"as any sociologist will attest , your childhood and the types of parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an adult . 

parents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives . 

but if your upbringing is marred with violence , hate and dysfunctionality , then your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome . 

`affliction' explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood . 

the man in question is wade whitehouse ( nick nolte ) . 

here is a man who is like any other citizen on the surface . 

he is a productive member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you and me . 

but as you scratch beneath the surface , something scary and evil begins to rear its ugly head . 

we see that he is a mean-tempered person . 

he has a hard time taking control of his emotions , which usually gets the better of him . 

he is quick to apologize for his actions and wants to be a gentle person , but something is sparking a tendency towards violence . 

he also has tremendous problems with relationships . 

he is divorced and his only connection to love is his daughter . 

but his bearish persona and stature alienates her . 

he is visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves him . 

his demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl ( sissy spacek ) at risk . 

she tries to remain true to him and supportive , but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this kind of person , relationships will ultimately end like sentences ending with an exclamation point . 

finally , he is spiteful and vindictive . 

as a rejected father , he initiates a custody battle that seems hopeless . 

as the town's only police officer , he issues a speeding ticket to a man whose father has just died . 

we can see that this is a man that is both afflicted and living with pain . 

he is a prisoner and a slave to it . 

he is moving towards a level of madness and insanity that defies comprehension . 

what kind of force can move a man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who genuinely care for him ? 

we learn that the answer is his father ( james coburn ) . 

this is the kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any woman would be afraid to meet . 

he is an overbearingly misogynistic and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist . 

we see his tyrannical behavior through flashbacks . 

to heighten the father's churlishness , the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken by a very frightened person . 

very effective . 

today , wade's dad is quite elderly , but still manages to instill fear into a grown man . 

the influence that the father possesses is inescapable , and its unsavory effect clamps down hard on the tortured wade . 

the result is every son's nightmare ? becoming like the father that one has always dreaded to be . 

this is a terrifically presented piece of psychological drama , and nolte turns in a strong performance as a man whose pain seems to become a detriment as well as a necessity . 

he's a hulking person who is still reduced to whimpers when in the presence of his father . 

coburn displays heft as the bitter dad . 

but , it's most certainly not saturday-night-friendly fare . 

there's nothing light or fluffy about this film . 

that may turn many moviegoers away . 

but it's certainly worth noting that this is a well-acted drama showcasing nolte's and coburn's raw acting talents .

"bowfinger is a good movie about the making of a very bad one . 

the screenplay , written by co-star steve martin , skewers everything in hollywood from cheesy science-fiction movies to chop-socky fight sequences , and all in a crafty and accomplished manner . 

anyone who knows of , or has had any association with movie-making should thoroughly enjoy this clever comedy for it's entire duration . 

the central premise behind the film is an inspired and promising one . 

bobby bowfinger ( martin ) , a cheapskate and small-time hollywood producer , has always dreamed of making a successful motion picture but has never attained the proper tools to do so . 

a new script , an alien invasion story entitled chubby rain , has caught bowfinger's eye . 

after confronting a big-name producer named jerry renfro ( robert downey jr . ) in a restaurant , an agreement is made to finance the movie . 

but first , bowfinger must get renowned action star kit ramsey ( eddie murphy ) to sign in on the project . 

kit turns the offer down immediately , but bowfinger still has the intent to shoot the film . 

after emptying out his life savings , the hapless producer tells the remaining cast and crew that ramsey is involved , and then prepares to film the movie without the star's knowledge . 

the actors confront ramsey on the street , saying their lines as hidden cameras peek through bushes to capture the footage . 

the unknowing star , who is terrified of aliens and being abducted , is brought to believe there is actually pod people after him . 

when the conditions become even more treacherous , bowfinger is forced to hire a kit ramsey look-alike named jiff ( also murphy ) , a sweet-natured dork who runs for coffee in-between shooting vital scenes . 

these include attempting a suicide run across an 8-lane freeway , and one of the `hot' scenes involving supporting actress daisy ( heather graham ) removing her blouse . 

bowfinger takes it's sweet time getting started , but when the plot switches into high gear , great things happen . 

certain scenes are so precisely executed , perfectly framing moments that are absolutely fall-down funny . 

no , hilarious . 

standouts include the chase through a parking garage in which ramsey , who's supposed to be being followed , keeps checking behind him to investigate a strange tapping noise ( it's actually bowfinger's dog in high heels ) . 

and just try not to laugh in the climactic kung-fu sequence , featuring jiff in an excerpt from another bowfinger classic entitled fake purse ninjas . 

while the entire 97-minutes of bowfinger isn't always on target , individual scenes may have you rolling in the aisles . 

masterful comedy director frank oz ( dirty rotten scoundrels , in and out ) , who has never made a bad movie , ensures a quality final product and is aided immensely by martin's sharp-edged script . 

however , the real on-screen star is eddie murphy . 

this is the actor's finest work since his breakthrough into the hollywood market in the early 80's . 

murphy excels at every corner , not only succeeding with presenting believable paranoia in the eyes of kit ramsey , but in creating a likable buffoon in jiff as well . 

these three talented comic minds have squeezed every morsel of potential out of this premise , and the reward is a virtually guaranteed helping of hearty laughs . 

steve martin generates the power behind bowfinger , but murphy fuels it . 

this is a summer-time comedy that , unlike something such as american pie and south park , doesn't break any rules . 

but it's still just as uproarious , or perhaps even more side-splitting than anything we've seen this season . 

the supporting cast , including christine baranski as a work-loving actress and jamie kennedy as the cameraman , all perform well within their limits . 

the only presence that demands real attention when placed next to martin or murphy is the beautiful heather graham , as the young film star who has plans to sleep her way to the top . 

graham , attempting to further her stardom after appearing as the new powers' girl in ap2 , displays a cheerful but naive persona that nicely corresponds with the wackiness of the screenplay . 

i wouldn't be caught dead buying a ticket for chubby rain , but watching how it all came about is certainly entertaining enough .

"i have nothing against unabashedly romantic films . 

when done right , with at least slightly evident restraint , they can be engaging , sweeping , appealing . 

but it's a hell of a shame when someone botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless in seattle , a hollow , boring romance that should appeal only to the most gullible of viewers ; the ones willing to buy into ephron's whiny views of life and romance . 

tom hanks and meg ryan , two of hollywood's most likeable stars play sam baldwin and annie reed , repectively . 

baldwin's wife recently died and he moved to seattle with his son , jonah , seeking to get away from the familiar surroundings which remind him of his late spouse . 

jonah senses tension and calls a talk radio show to tell the world about their problems . 

sam seems ready to strangle his son for calling the show , but when he gets on the phone he begins pouring his heart out . 

ephron has him do this so that annie reed ( meg ryan ) can hear it . 

annie is a happy woman . 

she is engaged to walter , an allergy-prone working man and seems to be perfectly content . 

but after hearing sam the widower on the radio show , she becomes convinced that he is her destiny and is willing to risk her engagement for it . 

five years after this movie hit theaters , hanks , ryan and ephron would team up again in the far better , although still sub-par romantic comedy you've got mail , which is about people who hate each other in real life falling in love on the internet . 

at least that movie had a sense of spontaneity . 

here it seems that the first one hundred minutes exist solely to set up for the last five . 

the fact that sam and annie will finally meet is so excruciatingly obvious that everything else is perfunctory . 

sleepless in seattle is full of wonderful performers ; from its two leads to supporting stars like bill pullman and rosie o'donnell . 

but none of them can save the film from being a bore . 

its characters are dull and empty , its script isn't funny or particularly charming . 

the script has a fundamental problem : annie gives up , for little reason , her life with walter to pursue "" sleepless in seattle , "" whom she has never even seen . 

it's the kind of life decision that real people don't make , and its a major , unforgivable plausibility sacrifice . 

in essence , this movie's purpose is to head towards a goal that shouldn't even exist . 

it's a ten minute short film with ninety-five minutes of filler . 

if you were to show me sleepless in seattle and i didn't have to review it , you could just call me "" asleep in philadelphia . ""

"according to hollywood movies made in last few decades , life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being . 

even worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark , god-forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience . 

on the other hand , it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america , because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view . 

this film is amarcord , 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini , which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages , and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life . 

the film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense . 

instead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs , as well as series of local , often very colourful characters . 

although many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator , movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist , 14-year old boy titta ( played by bruno zanin ) and chronicles his sexual frustrations , obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca ( played by magali noel ) , problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family , as well as troubles his father ( played by armando brancia ) have with mussolini's fascist regime . 

amarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film , and it probably explains why it is very popular , even among those people who actually don't like federico fellini's work very much . 

every member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film , because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible . 

distortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film - word "" amarcord "" is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase "" i remember "" in local italian dialect . 

in the same way the word is distorted , so is the past in memories of those who remember it . 

after the premiere , fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film , but it doesn't matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini's childhood or not ; any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film . 

fellini's views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film . 

even the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images . 

characters look like caricatures , actors playing them often deliberately overact , and women , especially those who fuel titta's sexual fantasies , often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions . 

every now and then , scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie's characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters' visions . 

because of that , almost everything in this film looks different , and in most cases better , than it would have looked in the real life . 

even the fascism gets fellinian make-over - fellini views mussolini's totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle ( explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history ) and opportunity for comedy . 

when fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents , even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour . 

unlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s , who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda , fellini doesn't care that much about politics . 

lack of self-righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini's humanistic approach to his characters . 

each of them , regardless of age , gender , social class or physical appearance , is given opportunity to express his or her views , dreams and fears . 

fellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection , even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people . 

because of this warmth and democratic spirit , amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th century , and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable , melancholic and even tragic moments . 

fellini couldn't produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie . 

vignettes aren't memorable because of the characters only ; fellini uses camera , painting film in bright colours , especially in the scenes that depict character's fantasies . 

fellini also knows how to use locations , whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel , bright-coloured beach or rural countryside . 

even the down-to-earth streets of rimini , where everyone knows everyone , gets magical dimension during the snowfall . 

on the other hand , lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene . 

this atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellini's long-time associate nino rota . 

his amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable , most popular and most relaxing and uplifting pieces of film music ever produced . 

that music alone should be the reason to view amarcord as one of the indisputable classics of seventh art .

"synopsis : a maniac , crazed by virulent microphage , slaughters more than twenty people , including a street gang and heavily-armed troops , with a small knife . 

even with a handgun , however , he can't take out the two cops who are after him , despite having shot one of them a total of seven times . 

comments : the most notable aspect of adrenalin : fear the rush is that it marks a striking career move for natasha henstridge . 

not only does she manage to keep all her clothes on ( her trademark in earlier films such as species and maximum risk was to strip naked as often as possible ) , but she actually puts on even more clothes as the film progresses . 

this will probably disappoint many henstridge fans , but i welcome the change because henstridge is an attractive , capable actress who deserves less exploitative roles ( though , i admit , it doesn't show in this mess ) . 

henstridge , just like every other actor in the film , delivers a wooden performance in this monumental turkey . 

 ( the cast also includes christopher lambert , who has appeared in the highlander and mortal kombat films . ) 

how on earth this movie got two big-name stars to appear in it is beyond me . 

adrenalin : fear the rush is set in boston ten years in the future ( 2007 ) . 

boston has changed dramatically in those ten years . 

it is now home to a bunch of interred foreigners and policed by cops who drive around in small cars with "" policia "" printed on their doors . 

some guy has a really bad virus , and he's killing people because of it . 

so , the brave good guys ( lambert and henstridge ) go after him . 

that's it . 

76 minutes never seemed so long . 

this is a drawn-out chase scene through dimly-lit abandoned buildings turned into an entire movie . 

the plot development is nil ; we learn absolutely nothing about lambert's character and very little about henstridge's character . 

the dialogue is littered with unnecessary obscenities and concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguments over who will go down the next dark corridor/tunnel/airduct next and who will carry the flashlight . 

a subplot does exist involving henstridge's character's illegal attempt to get her son out of boston . 

in her opening monologue , a monologue which sounds as though henstridge was reading from cue cards , we learn that she has gone to great lengths to secure a fake passport for her son . 

twenty minutes into the film , i wondered if the movie would have been better if it focused on this plot . 

in a defining scene of the movie , however , i changed my mind . 

this fake passport drops to the ground . 

lambert's cop immediately recognizes it as a fraud from six feet away . 

must not have been a good fake . 

this emphasizes another fault with the film . 

things just defy common sense . 

lambert's cop , for instance , is shot seven times , yet he is still able to talk and slide about . 

adrenalin : fear the rush ends in a trite manner that doesn't seem to even fit the mood that the filmmakers were trying for . 

i found myself rather bored with this film , which will disappoint both sci-fi/horror fans and fans of henstridge and lambert . 

don't fear the rush . 

fear the movie . 

watch something else .

"jet li busted onto the american action movie scene , when he stole the show in 1998's lethal weapon 4 , with his wicked looks , his nasty moves and his undeniable charisma . 

it only took another two years for mega-producer joel silver to set him up in an all-american movie , primed to take over some of the empty action-hero seats left by alleged coke-head van damme and that pudgy guy named steven seagal . 

would this film take li past his rival asian action counterparts , namely chow yun-fat and jackie chan ? 

let's find out . 

plot : rival chinese and black gangster organizations fall further out of favor from one another , when members of their respective families start turning up dead . 

that's when badass jet li blasts into the picture to find out who the men were behind his brother's death and to exact some of his own style of revenge . 

critique : three words : not enough action ! 

simple enough ? 

not enough hong kong kickass jet li action to compensate for a horribly predictable screenplay , bad actors , crappy dialogue and oh-so many over-the-top melodramatic moments . 

and a romance angle ? 

why , one must ask . . . why ? 

i love fight scenes and i really dig jet li too , but this little ditty barely contained three memorable action sequences , and jet , well , the poor dude was barely in the movie . 

and i thought this was supposed to be his big break ? 

how 'bout giving the slickster some more opportunities to show us his kung-fu fighting chops , slap him in a few more scenes , and give him more chances to practice his acting/english abilities ? 

what a letdown . 

even black mask was more entertaining than this glossed up , empty shell of a film . 

in fact , i am sure that more time was spent gathering the "" hits "" for the soundtrack of this film , than were on the so-called "" screenplay "" . 

i felt like i was watching a soundtrack rather than a movie most of the time . 

the sad part about the bad script is that it wouldn't matter so much if the film actually had some decent actors spouting out the tacky lines . 

but no , save lindo and aaliyah , who weren't too shabby , i thought the rest of the cast was picked primarily from their inability to deliver lines convincingly . 

and what was the deal with the whole nfl franchise deal run by some 15-year old looking guy , acting like he's the overlord of a drug ring ? ! 

what a mess . 

then again , i don't want it to seem like i'm complaining solely about the story which was completely foreseeable , since we all go to see these movies for the action anyway , not the story . 

well , i guess that's what disappointed me the most out of this film . 

there were a couple of cool fight scenes with li , but simply not enough to satisfy my overall craving . 

also , as much as i love the way they incorporate wires and special effects in some of their stunts , a couple of the exaggerated fight scenes were simply too obvious a stunt . 

it should be seamless , fellas , not necessarily against the laws of gravity ! 

the one cool thing that was original in the movie was the way in which the director showed us some of the inside cracklings of the human body when penetrated by a blow , but that simple creative touch couldn't save the rest of this film's uninteresting plot movements . 

i'm disappointed for jet li that this film didn't give him the real opportunity to star in a good story with many great action scenes . 

hopefully , the next time will be a charm for this charismatic actor . 

for now , i just hope that for his sake , the film's title isn't a premonition of the movie's ultimate fate at the box-office .

"waiting at the train station near the beginning of fury , joe says : `after all , we're human . ' 

in the context of events to transpire , joe's line is prophetic , foreshadowing the internal conflict of the protagonist in the latter half of the film . 

does being human necessarily imply humane behavior ? 

through the baseness of human character exemplified in the formation of a mob , fritz lang prompts the viewer to consider whether our inclination towards impulsiveness supersedes our civility . 

expressing his abhorrence towards the rise of nazism in his homeland , lang takes great care in creating a sense of discomfort during the scenes of mob hysteria . 

in the scene prefacing the lynching , the mob achieves critical mass at the bar . 

deputy meyers is brought in as an exalted informant , but when he is unable to augment the mob's myth of joe , he is quickly renounced from his position as town gossip . 

we see in a shot where two bar patrons are arguing that the deputy looks around nervously at the growing monster and then carefully slips out of the bar . 

what is quietly horrifying is the realization by both the audience and the deputy that the crowd no longer exists within the confines of reason and has succumbed to what the barber referred to as impulse . 

what once was excitement to the deputy has turned into fear with the realization that he is now powerless . 

to the audience , the deputy's quiet exit concurs with their own sinking feeling of uneasiness as the mob's delirium crescendos . 

lang educes this discomfort not through movement of the camera , but rather its stillness . 

the shot's composition places the audience equidistant and directly across from the pair of arguing patrons and the deputy effectively becomes a mirror to our own apprehensions . 

as the intensity of the mob closes around deputy meyers , it does so around the viewer as well . 

the stationary camera in this shot heightens our fears because when the deputy escapes , we are deserted by our reflection and the viewer becomes the sole proprietor of sensibility amongst a swarm of irrationality . 

because the camera does not track the deputy's movement , we are left with an amplified perception of desertion and vulnerability . 

as the bar scene progresses , the camera pans 180 degrees to reveal the fury of the mob . 

this shot is unique because it is a point-of-view shot where the audience , not a character in the film is the subject . 

while a long , or dolly shot may objectively reveal the size of the mob , panning from the mob's belly distorts the audience's spatial reference and exaggerates the claustrophobia of the scene ; we feel we are at the epicenter of something infinitely large . 

we see close shots of people's faces , contorted by their rage . 

with the pivot of the pan being in the center of the mob and angry members within a short radius of the pan , lang offers the viewer a sense of what it feels like to be the subject of a lynching . 

in this shot the audience is at the mercy of the mob ; lang's camera makes us feel vulnerable and powerless as joe must have felt in the jail . 

in some greater sense , it must have been what lang felt when he saw his countrymen overcome with unjustifiable hatred towards their own humankind . 

lang's observations of his fellow man succumbing to mob behavior left him with an indelible image of malevolent human behavior . 

as joe faces his peril , trapped in his burning cell , his dog rainbow rushes to be by his side . 

lang makes rainbow a martyr to contrast his humanity against the recklessness of his human counterparts . 

using his camera to create shots that elicit disturbing images of mob mentality , lang depicts man's volatility and `impulse' towards inconceivable cruelty . 

reprising joe' s line at the train station , we are induced to question why our primeval impulses so easily transcend our humanity .

"there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom , surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong-worded attack on a group of stoic doctors . 

when i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way , i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture . 

you see , patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries . 

i hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it , and i actively hate it now , days later , with the simpering , superficial , nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories . 

i hate every element of the film , beginning with tom shadyac's shameless direction , and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey . 

the badness of patch adams is stupefying . 

it's confounding . 

i can't believe a film can be this bad . 

and yet , it's based on a real man who probably has a good point to make . 

in the film , patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams , in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human . 

in the beginning of the film , patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn't want to kill himself . 

while there , he notices that the doctors don't care about the patients , and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings . 

so , patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients . 

he goes to medical school , where he meets truman ( daniel london ) and convinces him that it's good to help people . 

he also meets carin fischer ( monica potters ) , the anti-male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor . 

naturally , the dean of the medical school ( bob gunton ) hates patch , and wants to thwart his plans , even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams . 

so patch decides that he's going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have . 

and that , my friends , is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998 . 

on a superficial level , the film is not particularly bad : i wouldn't say the cinematography bothered me , and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for ( i actually liked potter's performance , even if she is wasted ) . 

but the film fails fundamentally in execution . 

every scene swells with grand , "" emotional "" music , played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard . 

take , for instance , the first scene , which shows patch sitting on a bus . 

we don't know patch yet , but there's sad music , and it's supposed to make us really sad that he's sad . 

later on , patch makes a lot of progress : he helps a dying patient ( peter coyote ) to enjoy the last days of his life , and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively . 

and when that patient finally dies ( spoiler alert ! ) , the music is very very sad . 

but the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions . 

real drama is character-based . 

you grow to like someone , and then something bad happens , and you feel it . 

we don't ever grow to know the dying patient ; he's simply a vehicle for patch's greatness . 

real drama doesn't seem forced , or present just to make the audience cry . 

that's why patch adams is not real drama . 

it goes for every cheap tear imaginable , wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene . 

even scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman's sickening musical score . 

sentimentality like this is indeed bad . 

but it's not as bad as half-baked , simplistic themes . 

you see , patch is a really great student . 

he aces his tests without studying , and does it so effectively that people think he's cheating . 

but patch doesn't think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor . 

 "" why don't we see patients until the third year ? "" he bursts out every three seconds . 

well , patch , that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients . 

not everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort . 

most of us have to study . 

and a doctor who really wants to help , but doesn't know a toe from a finger , probably won't be too successful in preventing death . 

oh wait , i almost forgot : the point of doctors is not just to "" prevent death , "" but to "" improve the quality of life ! "" 

yes ! 

that is true ! 

and you can not do that without studying . 

you can not do that without going to medical school . 

what patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe , just maybe , it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later . 

follow the rules ? 

bah ! 

who needs the rules ! 

only uptight doctors follow the rules . 

the real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants . 

and then there's the free clinic issue , which i find shockingly , frighteningly idealistic . 

a free clinic . 

in the middle of the forest . 

where patients can be taken to be helped . 

for free . 

how will patients be transported to the free clinic ? 

will it have an emergency room ? 

or is it just for mental patients ? 

and who , may i ask , will pay for it ? 

the film does give some token attempts to question patch's motives ( i think another character asks him how he's going to pay for it , in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance ) , but they certainly don't explore or challenge patch's ideas to any meaningful extent . 

reader , please understand this : i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams . 

i know nothing about him . 

if his beliefs mirror those of this film character , then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them . 

but regardless of what the real patch adams believes , the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony . 

and in the last scene , the big , obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus , patch does a lot of shouting . 

actually , robin williams does a lot of shouting . 

he shouts a lot about helping people , and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words . 

i won't tell you that you can't be moved by his words , because i , too , was moved by his words . 

i was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap and phony a cinematic experience can be . 

patch adams is the cheapest of them all .

"phil ( radmar jao ) has a hairy problem . 

his beard is growing so rapidly that he has to shave every hour . 

he recently met the author of a non-fiction book on lycanthropy , also referred to in the movie as werewolfism , and phil now believes that his problem is that he has become a werewolf . 

using enough chains and handcuffs to be a hit at a sadomasochists convention , he ties himself in at night lest his urges overcome him . 

and phil is just one of the many quirky characters that inhabit shopping for fangs . 

made on a pittance , the film features an almost exclusively asian-american cast . 

as directed by quentin lee and justin lin , the movie is so amateurishly bad that it could almost be a parody of indie films . 

jeanne chin plays katherine , a meek and soft-spoken wife , who worries that her husband is unhappy with her because she is not giving him enough sex . 

we know this through the endless scenes of her confessing her sins , real and imagined , to her therapist . 

as her husband , jim , clint jung plays a muscle man with a macho crudeness . 

the picture is filled with stereotypes . 

there's a mysterious , loud-mouthed waitress with a big , platinum blonde wig who brags to everyone she meets that she's a lesbian . 

she spends most of the movie putting the moves on her favorite customer , a gay guy . 

and the lone white with a major role , the author on werewolfism , has wildly unkempt , orangey blonde , curly hair . 

from its opening scene of an attempted rape at knifepoint to its easy to guess ending twist , the script rarely has anything to offer . 

the story is so minimally developed that it feels almost like the actors were ad-libbing . 

one can only hope that the directors' next film will have some substance and some credible acting . 

shopping for fangs runs 1 : 30 . 

it is rated r for sex , violence , and profanity and would be fine for older teenagers .

"it was a crazy time in france , what with the french revolution right around the corner . 

king louis xv would soon die , and his son would become king louis xvi . 

such is the setting for beaumarchais : the scoundrel about the controversial playwright , spy and playboy pierre-augustin caron de beaumarchais . 

beaumarchais was the author of the plays , "" the barber of seville "" and "" the marriage of figaro . "" 

today people think of them as quaint and harmless operas , but , back in 1773 when the movie takes place , they were so scandalous that beaumarchais was thrown into prison more than once . 

the movie beaumarchais : the scoundrel takes a light-hearted approach to its subject , resulting in an inviting motion picture . 

one of france's most expensive productions ever , the movie was a huge hit when it opened there last year . 

now in theatrical release in the united states , it eschews the seriousness of most art house films with a romping good story . 

the secret of the film's success , other than the lavishness of sylvie de segonzac's costumes , has to be the performance by fabrice luchini as beaumarchais . 

with his glistening eyes and his infectious smile , he mesmerizes the camera and the audience . 

his wry little lips seem always to hint at some unspoken deviousness he is planning . 

in a land where court intrigue determines one's destiny , constant scheming was a way of life for the aristocracy . 

as our story starts , we learn that beaumarchais has bought himself a judgeship . 

into his court comes a member of the nobility demanding an immediate sword fight . 

beaumarchais , who has been having an affair with the man's wife , makes him wait until the current case on the docket is decided . 

that over with , the fight is on . 

with luchini's charisma , it is hard to root for anyone other than him . 

audiences may remember him from the marvelous colonel chabert , in which he played the attorney . 

although he does not have half of the good looks of his assistant gudin , played by manuel blanc , he dazzles the women and the viewers with his grace and style . 

michael epp's warm and intimate cinematography provides a nice accompaniment to jean-marc kerdelhue's lush but realistic looking sets . 

jean-claude petit's music , especially the hauntingly lovely flute solos , make for an enchanting time at the movies . 

director jean-claude brisville , who wrote the script along with edouard molinaro , fleshed out a play by sacha guitry which , according to the press notes , was just a series of historic vignettes . 

the disorganization of the play still comes through at some points in the movie , but the actors smooth it over with their good-hearted style . 

typical of the scenes that come out of nowhere is the one in which a rotund benjamin franklin appears in a large pot of hot water , taking his bath . 

one episode has beaumarchais working with a renegade spy who may or may not be a man . 

another has beaumarchais using his personal fortune to aid the american revolution . 

all of this may sound like a dull historical drama , but it is anything but . 

the story plays more like theater of the absurd than a movie based on historical facts . 

the radiantly lovely sandrine kiberlain plays marie-therese , the real love of beaumarchais's life . 

but he is so likable that members of the audience may want to compete with her for him . 

still , with his beguiling smile , one can never quite be sure if you should trust him . 

the movie , on the other hand , can be trusted to deliver a high old time . 

beaumarchais : the scoundrel runs 1 : 41 . 

it is in french with english subtitles . 

the film is not rated but would be an r for some nudity and sex , and should be fine for most teenagers .

"bruce willis needs to stay away from straightforward action pictures . 

mercury rising adds to a growing list ( including such stinkers as the jackal , last man standing , striking distance and the last boy scout ) of stale actioners he has headlined . 

and though mercury rising tries to spice things up by throwing an autistic kid in the mix , it is every bit as stale . 

art jeffries ( bruce willis ) is your typical tormented fbi agent . 

you know the type , haunted by his job , yet so good at what he does that even physically assaulting another agent merely gets him a slap on the wrist . 

enter simon ( miko hughes ) , an autistic boy , who , like rain man and all other autistic people , is a savant . 

he can merely gaze at a super-encrypted message , and , while little computer beeps go off in his head , he can understand what it says . 

naturally , this talent has brought him to the attention of the federal government . 

lt . col . nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) , an nsa official bubbling over with evil , has spent countless time and money implementing the newest "" unbreakable "" code , mercury . 

however , when two of his underlings ( robert stanton and bodhi pine elfman ) publish a mercury-encrypted message in a puzzle magazine as a final test of its effectiveness , simon cracks the code . 

naturally , this infuriates kudrow , who sends a terminator-like hitman ( l . l . 

ginter ) to eliminate the security hazard . 

and that's where art jeffries comes in . 

for some reason that's never explained in the film , the fbi is called in to help , and through a series of intricate machinations , art becomes the sole protector of the young autistic boy . 

in a few unrealistic sequences , he enlists the aid of a stranger , stacey ( kim dickens ) , to help out , but she is given very little to do overall . 

the central concept behind mercury rising is ludicrous . 

why bother trying to kill the kid . . . i 

mean , who would know ? 

it's not like the kid ( or anyone else for that matter ) knew he was cracking a government super-cypher . 

and even if he is eliminated , what does that help ? 

he's already proven that mercury can be broken . 

there's always the chance that someone else would crack it . . . but 

i guess without a kid in jeopardy , there's not much of a movie here . 

for all its faults , the film actually starts relatively well ( once you pass the painfully familiar teaser ) . 

the film flirts with developing real characters , and a semblance of a plot . . . then 

mr . terminator the hitman appears and everything begins going downhill . . . quickly . 

miko hughes does a decent job , for his age , at creating a touching performance . 

however , don't go to this film looking for any new insights into autism ( not that many people will ) . 

instead he merely becomes the latest unique partner in a routine buddy-cop movie ( think cop and a half . . . with a twist ! ) 

willis and baldwin are just overplaying to type . 

rather than creating a nuanced character , baldwin simply oozes sliminess . 

and for willis' part , he simply recycles the stock role of the loner cop/fbi agent ( which he has honed in the die hard series ) . 

as almost an afterthought , about halfway through , the film carelessly gives him a character trait ( an addiction ) , and then drops it in the next scene . 

but the biggest problem with mercury rising is the screenplay . 

this film wasn't well thought out at all . 

the film goes to extraordinary lengths to pad in as many convenient coincidences as possible . 

the carbon paper scene alone is unworthy of the most gullible audience member . 

at first the bad scenes just trickle in , but by the gruesomely bad finale they're a veritable flood . 

the film's few decent moments come in the form of bad jokes ( mainly from the geeks who developed the supercode ) . 

but they're not nearly enough to make the film worthwhile . 

mercury rising is a thriller that you're more likely to groan at than cheer . 
"
"i didn't realize how apt the name of this movie was until i called the mpaa ( the motion picture association of america - the folks who decide what's g , nc 17 , pg , r or x ) to ask why the preview was rated r . so that we can make some sense of their response , let me tell you about the movie itself . 

 "" the celluloid closet "" is a documentary about how homosexuality has been portrayed in the movies over the past several decades . 

it's brilliant , funny , naughty and extremely poignant . 

it tore at my heart to watch a gifted lesbian screenwriter explain that , as a rule , gay audiences hunger for any hint of homosexuality on screen . 

regardless of how veiled - or how sordid - the presence of a gay or lesbian person allows others to lessen their sense of isolation and makes them feel as if they're not quite so invisible as america seems to want them to be . 

the movie itself is rated r - and for good reason . 

it contains scenes of bloody , violent gay bashing and graphic , uninhibited , sex . 

as with any movie , i appreciate knowing about these things ahead of time , so i can decide for myself whether to see the movie with a friend , a date , my 11 year old niece , alone or not at all . 

but , that's the movie . 

now back to the preview . 

prior to this film being theatrically released ( it was originally filmed as a documentary for hbo ) i had seen the coming attractions trailer for it at least six times . 

there was no nudity , no violence , no bad language , nothing that i could see that would be offensive or inappropriate for a general audience ( okay , whoopi goldberg did refer to someone "" boning "" someone , but the last i knew that wasn't one of the seven words you can't say on tv ) . 

except for a scene of two fully clothed men kissing . 

hmmmmm . 

when i inquired about the rating on the trailer , a very nice woman at the mpaa quoted from "" the handbook "" that a trailer approved for all audiences could contain "" no homosexuality or lesbianism and no going down on someone . "" 

hello ? i was in the office and it was the middle of the day . 

bravely , i pursued . 

 "" i've seen that trailer , oh . . . 

probably half a dozen times , "" i gulped . . . 

 "" and i don't remember that scene . "" 

 "" well , "" she chirped . 

 "" it's there . 

our little eyes are trained to see that . "" 

no really . 

in the words of dave barry , "" i am not making this up . "" 

they are "" trained "" to "" see that ? "" 

when someone who was shocked at the rating the first time and made a note to watch it carefully the following five times or so managed to let it slip past her ? 

gosh , i certainly don't mean to question the mpaa , or "" the handbook "" . 

i would , however , like to suggest that it's they who are in the closet on this one . 

and the light ain't good in there . 

but , having seen "" the celluloid closet , "" and being one of a handful of straight people involved in a primarily gay and lesbian weekly bible study ( email me and i'll give you the details ) , none of this was any big surprise . 

the point of the movie was that homosexuality , even in the politically correct 90s , is ridiculously perceived as a threat to a mostly heterosexual society . 

a point well made in this candid and honest film . 

now , i could go off on the mpaa's ruling that a trailer must contain "" no homosexuality or lesbianism "" and ask how that is defined , particularly in light of some of the things , both sexual and non-sexual , that i've watched straight people do in trailers . 

i just don't feel the need to go there , because it seems so obvious . 

i'll instead suggest that the mpaa re-evaluated their evaluation criteria . 

let the ratings reflect not subject content , like "" sex "" and "" violence "" . 

let them reflect attitude content . 

in the future , i'd be interested in knowing whether the movie is rated d for disrespectful or s for stereotyped . 

then i'd truly be able to make an informed decision about how i spent my time .

"around the end of 1998 , a japanese cartoon came to the usa television , and really wasn't that big . 

in fact not many people even knew what pokemon was , but in 1999 it hit big with kids and adults alike , and became one of the biggest franchises and merchandise seller of all time . 

in fact it even spawned a big screen adventure pokemon : the first movie which for what it was , wasn't all that bad . 

it grossed $31 million in its opening weekend , and went on to make almost $90 million . 

fans thought it was great and now is a second movie in the pokemon craze , "" pokemon : the movie 2000 "" which is far inferior to the original animated movie . 

first up is the plot , which there really isn't much of , in fact the plot what there is : a bad guy trying to destroy the ancient never before seen pokemon , lugia , is about it , except the fact that ash kethcum the worlds best pokemon trainer must try and stop him before he destroys this one pokemon forever . 

well there you go , of course ash is followed by his friends misty , brock , gary and his pokemon friends , pikachu , squirtle , charizard , the usual . 

even though the first movie wasn't a great film , it was definately an enjoyable well-made movie with an actual thin storyline . 

this new movie however is nothing but garbage , there is nothing good to it storywise , and its only good thing comes from some plush animation and colors . 

compared to the first film , this movie is awfully bland , from its opening titles , to the end titles it tries its best to work , but fails miserably at every corner . 

the characters are 1-dimensional , the story thin as chicken broth , and the writing very lame . 

even the so called action scenes are extremely lame , and falls before it even gets a chance to go . 

the voices even aren't that good and almost feels like the stars don't want to be there , like they can tell that this is an extremel bad movie . 

which it certainly is . 

the film has one thing going for it and that is the animation , although not up to disney standards , it is still very good with some interesting cgi's and very colorful animation , the colors jump out at you very fast , and seem very nicely put on film . 

why a film this bad got such a good treatment with its animation is still a question to be answered , hopefully pokemon 3 next year will be much better than this trash . 

for now watch the first one . 

its much much better .

"if you haven't plunked down your hard-earned money yet for "" wild wild west , "" the latest summer holiday offering from will smith , let me say right now that your money will be better spent on a starbuck's frappacino or on a ben & jerry's sundae . 

these treats are great relief from the summer heat . 

in contrast , this film made me simmer in disappointment . 

i can accept the fact that summer movies tend to put more weight into special effects and that good stories and flavorful characters usually take a back seat . 

this was true of star wars episode i , but at least in that film , the story and the characters were still in the back seat . 

in this film , they are no where to be found . 

what remains are hundreds of male extras costumed as gunslingers and foppish aristocrats , lots of female extras who look like can-can dancers , and a clunky , 80-foot tall instrument of destruction that resembles a mechanical tarantula . 

two men are asked to stop this threat . 

one is artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , an inventor who uses his intellect and array of disguises to best his opponents . 

among his creations are false breasts and the bulletproof vest . 

the other man is jim west ( will smith ) , who prefers the shoot-first-then-shoot-some-more method of investigating . 

although their individual talents must be combined to achieve success , their interaction with one another merely seemed like a second rate , two-man vaudevillian act . 

for example , there is a scene where west , being more debonair than the reserved gordon , notes that the fake breasts should be filled with water rather than buckwheat , which is what it is currently filled with . 

 "" now touch my breast , "" west says . 

gordon does so and then softly coos his approval . 

i found myself groaning at this kind of silliness . 

the script fails to generate any sense of drama , humor , or fun for that matter . 

i did enjoy kline's reserved performance , but was surprised at how much latitude they gave to smith . 

could it be that will smith is just so bankable that he's not even required to act ? 

it was as if the director was yelling "" will smith , do your own thing . . . and 

action ! "" 

here's an example . 

in this scene , will smith is about to be hanged by a group of angry white people . 

he must endear himself to the crowd to escape . 

the director yells , "" will smith , do your own thing . . . and 

action ! "" 

in another scene , he has to masquerade as a belly dancer in order to save his comrades . 

 "" will smith , do your own thing . . . and 

action ! "" 

worse still , the final battle scene aboard the mechanical tarantula is a horrid mess . 

there are cogs spinning and pulleys pulling and levers going up and down everywhere you look . 

there's actually a lot of imagination at work in this film . 

there are some genuinely clever inventions and gizmos introduced , but all of this imagination is wasted in a film that is visually cluttered and dramatically flat . 

and that's too bad because if there was more focus on the story rather than will smith just doing his 'thing , ' this film might have been palatable . 

as it turns out , "" wild wild west "" is the wild , wild worst and receives my vote for biggest disappointment of the year .

"many people dislike french films for their lack of closure . 

while possibly shallow , i've often had a desire for a sense of epiphany , or at least a resolution , in the films which i view . 

there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional ; however , the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion-denying protagonist , stephane ( daniel auteuil ) . 

stephane ( daniel auteuil ) is a master violin maker . 

he is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing . 

even the relationship between he and his boss , maxime ( andre dussollier ) is a controlled , and almost manipulated association , highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches . 

in the beginning of the movie , stephane is a closed , solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man . 

camille kessler ( emmanuelle beart ) is a master violinist and the new love of maximes . 

maxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife . 

like stephane , camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved , sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges . 

when stephane and camille meet , there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals . 

however , whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane , stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him . 

stephane ignores his feelings for camille , which the audience cannot help but to see is present . 

as the movie progresses , the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another . 

these two people , with very similar approaches to life initially , react to their new circumstance very differently . 

stephane becomes even more rational and controlled , while camille becomes more tempestuous , until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship . 

however , their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation . 

the audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well , due to his relationship with a master violin teacher . 

however , apparently , he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing . 

consequently , stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays . 

in contrast , camille had almost given the violin , years earlier . 

however , with the aid of her manager , she has progressed to being almost one of the world's finest , successfully submerging herself to her playing . 

during the course of the movie , we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions . 

stephane attempts to remain unchanged . 

however , we do see subtle hints of his transformation . 

one of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash . 

the development of all of the characters , many of which is not included in this synopsis , is incredible . 

american movies , with rare exceptions , have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development . 

in its essence , this movie is about the development and growth of the characters , camille and stephane . 

the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie , including a death , is to further the development of camille's and stepahne's characters . 

i am not sure why berardinelli says , "" at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified , and it is to auteuil's credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty . "" 

this movie is not about judging stephane's actions as being right or wrong , but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are . 

i find the ending appropriate ; unfortunately , i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling . 

this portion of the film is where the "" sense of closure "" could have been successfully accomplished . 

unfortunately , there is a hurried and almost a soap opera-type surge of emotions from all of the characters . 

while ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart , ravel has his day in this film . 

the synergism of the tension of ravel's music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen . 

the directing in this movie is wonderful . 

the actors and actresses are excellent , each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth . 

emmanuelle beart's personality is beautiful . 

and needless to say , i must say that emmanuelle beart , herself , is beautiful . 

besides the near ending , the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral . 

i almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of . 

the one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot , has their attitude towards love changed ? 

i have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at , but i am unsure of which the director is espousing . 

in summary , this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship . 

in the process , we see their attitude towards life and other people . 

in itself , i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie . 

where it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we , as americans , have preconceived american notions of relationship , love , and people . 

i do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture . 

however , i , bringing my american preconceptions , enjoyed the film . 

i would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it . 
"
" "" quest for camelot "" is warner bros . ' first feature-length , fully-animated attempt to steal clout from disney's cartoon empire , but the mouse has no reason to be worried . 

the only other recent challenger to their throne was last fall's promising , if flawed , 20th century fox production "" anastasia , "" but disney's "" hercules , "" with its lively cast and colorful palate , had her beat hands-down when it came time to crown 1997's best piece of animation . 

this year , it's no contest , as "" quest for camelot "" is pretty much dead on arrival . 

even the magic kingdom at its most mediocre -- that'd be "" pocahontas "" for those of you keeping score -- isn't nearly as dull as this . 

the story revolves around the adventures of free-spirited kayley ( voiced by jessalyn gilsig ) , the early-teen daughter of a belated knight from king arthur's round table . 

kayley's only dream is to follow in her father's footsteps , and she gets her chance when evil warlord ruber ( gary oldman ) , an ex-round table member-gone-bad , steals arthur's magical sword excalibur and accidentally loses it in a dangerous , booby-trapped forest . 

with the help of hunky , blind timberland-dweller garrett ( carey elwes ) and a two-headed dragon ( eric idle and don rickles ) that's always arguing with itself , kayley just might be able to break the medieval sexist mold and prove her worth as a fighter on arthur's side . 

 "" quest for camelot "" is missing pure showmanship , an essential element if it's ever expected to climb to the high ranks of disney . 

there's nothing here that differentiates "" quest "" from something you'd see on any given saturday morning cartoon -- subpar animation , instantly forgettable songs , poorly-integrated computerized footage . 

 ( compare kayley and garrett's run-in with the angry ogre to herc's battle with the hydra . 

i rest my case . ) 

even the characters stink -- none of them are remotely interesting , so much that the film becomes a race to see which one can out-bland the others . 

in the end , it's a tie -- they all win . 

that dragon's comedy shtick is awfully cloying , but at least it shows signs of a pulse . 

at least fans of the early-'90s tgif television line-up will be thrilled to find jaleel "" urkel "" white and bronson "" balki "" pinchot sharing the same footage . 

a few scenes are nicely realized ( though i'm at a loss to recall enough to be specific ) , and the actors providing the voice talent are enthusiastic ( though most are paired up with singers who don't sound a thing like them for their big musical moments -- jane seymour and celine dion ? ? ? ) . 

but one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good . 

aside from the fact that children will probably be as bored watching this as adults , "" quest for camelot "" 's most grievous error is its complete lack of personality . 

and personality , we learn from this mess , goes a very long way .

"some movies ask you to leave your brain at the door , some movies ask you to believe in the impossible to really have a good time . 

playing god asks just one simple , eensy , teensy thing so it can fully entertain you , it's accomplished in just four easy to follow steps : crack open your skull , scoop out your brain , squish it under your foot several times and reverse steps two and one . 

congratulations , you now have all the necessary requirements to fully enjoy a whole lot of nothing . 

some movies fail at the box office but you manage to see why the producers thought it could have been a good movie , others are simply good ideas that are badly executed . 

then there's playing god , which enters the esteemed category of movies which seem to have grown from the union of a drunk director , actors satisfied in the knowledge that this horrible flick will have no lasting impact on their careers and a bunch of rip-offs ( or homages as they like to call it ) from other , better movies that end up looking like an unflushed toilet . 

harsh ? maybe . 

justified ? 

hell yes ! 

this is a movie that is not just satisfied in ripping off other movies but feels the need to remind us of that fact every ten minutes . 

for example , a gunman bursts into a garden with the two guns in his hands firing away . 

this does look moderately kool , but the camera lingers on the actor for so long you can almost hear the director yelling : "" oooh , look look ! 

john woo ! 

two guns blazing ! 

slooooow motion ! "" 

and if that wasn't enough , you can also hear the script grunting under the effort it must take to try and make every single line of dialogue sound like something deep and meaningful like in a tarantino movie . 

poor timothy hutton gets to deliver most of the corny lines , you have to admire the effort he puts into it , this guy deserves better . 

unlike most movies this one does not suffer from "" stupid bad guy "" syndrome , just to make things a little different this time we get stupid heroes . 

example : duchovny manages to distract a bad guy by making him go into the bathroom to get some bandages . 

now the bad guy is , like , stoned , man , so he leaves his shotgun next to our hero . 

 ( term used as loosely as possible ) 

survival instincts and a good dose of common sense seems to suggest grabbing the shotgun , which our hero does , but only after contemplating it for about thirty seconds . 

even when he does grab it he seems unsure how to hold it , going so far as to actually wonder if he should place a finger near the trigger . 

mind you , i've never fired a shotgun in my life but believe you me that the bad guy would be missing most of his vital organs , be he stoned or not . 

some will argue that our hero does not have a killer instinct , the hell with that ! 

two fbi guys have just been shot in front me , along with one bad guy and the other looks like he might go ballistic at any second . 

solution ? 

boom ! 

i'll take the time to feel sorry about it later thank you very much . 

another prime example of the idiot hero syndrome : 

our boy duchovny needs to reach his girl before something bad happens to her . 

he knows the head bad guy has her on the tenth floor of a building and that he might be running into a room full of people with itchy trigger fingers . 

he still has his shotgun , bring it along you say ? 

no thanks , i'll just ditch it in the back of my car . 

and the real kicker is this : when he reaches the room and people start shooting at him he has the nerve to look surprised ! 

while we are on the subject of getting shot , why in hades were those fbi guys sitting with their backs to the door ? 

i've got no formal training but even i know you never sit with your back to the door . 

ask mr . wild bill , the first and only time he did not sit with his back to a wall cost him his life . 

this is the major problem with this movie , any mook could have thought of a hundred ways to make it better . 

is it so much to ask that hollywood actually put a little common sense into their characters ? 

for instance : 

our heroes hide at duchovny's summer home , now the bad guys could come knocking at any moment . 

ok , this time our hero does get himself a gun and has it at his side most of the time . 

but see , our hero is a drug addict and guess what ? 

he chooses now to go clean and suffer through dt . 

oh sure , he'll be really impressive when the bad guys come calling . 

going clean is really honorable of him , but i would have waited until i did not need to be conscious or being able to fire a gun . 

for an enjoyable performance by timothy hutton , plot holes the size of godzilla , getting our intelligence insulted and several "" oh come on ! "" 

moments .

"kevin smith is like a big kid . 

his humor is that of a sophisticated juvenile's . 

he grew up idolizing star wars and loves comic books , having also written a few . 

he also has a cult following , mostly composed of teenagers , college students , and smith's own fellow adolescent-minded grownups . 

smith is hilarious in person and in writing , but when he tries to be earnest and moralize , that is when he goes wrong . 

kevin smith is a better writer than director , and he'll be the first to tell you that . 

that might also be part of the reason why his moralizing comes across as so heavy-handed . 

great directors show us their theses instead of having the characters sermonize them . 

this was true in the overrated chasing amy , and it is true for dogma as well . 

that is not to say smith's message is a bad one . 

in dogma , smith tells us that problems arise when people believe beyond any doubt that their insight into god and god's desires is superior to anyone else's . 

basically , dogmatism is bad . 

changing the minds of the dogmatic is virtually impossible , and since the dogmatic believe that they have special insight , they also know what is best for you , whether you like it or not . 

this is not exactly a new message in movies ( see inherit the wind ) , but i have no problems with recycling old ones , particularly since dogma's protesters are proving smith's point . 

smith's own problem with delivering this message is that he beats us over the head with it like we are reading a dogma for dummies book . 

but this is smith's personality , and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret the bible ( or koran , etc . ) correctly ( or if there even is a correctly ) and how one settles disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns . 

the story concerns abortion clinic worker bethany ( linda fiorentino ) being chosen by voice of god , metatron ( alan rickman ) , to prevent the destruction of the universe by two fallen angels , bartleby ( ben affleck ) and angel of death , loki ( matt damon ) . 

along the way , forgotten thirteenth apostle , rufus ( chris rock ) , stripper muse serendipity ( salma hayek ) , and slacker duo jay and silent bob ( jason mewes and kevin smith himself ) come to bethany's aid . 

fallen muse , azrael ( jason lee ) , proves to be the behind-the-scenes manipulator for all the chicanery . 

the logical but convoluted plot only exists as an excuse for the jokes and to make smith's points , and in itself , has little dramatic momentum . 

among the supposedly outrageous claims made by the film is that god is a woman , jesus was black , and the bible was written by a bunch of racist , misogynistic white men . 

of course , kevin smith does not necessarily subscribe to these ideas himself . 

they are a metaphor for the fears and insecurities of the dogmatic . 

smith says as much in his amusing disclaimer that precedes the movie . 

when harvey weinstein asked smith to put it into the film before cannes , smith thought it might give validation to protesters' claims that the film was sacrilegious , but then he rethought it and turned the disclaimer into a joke . 

the film's humor is uneven . 

some parts are very funny as when bethany goes for a fire extinguisher when metatron makes a burning-bush kind of entrance . 

but many of the film's jokes just bomb , as in virtually anything involving salma hayek's serendipity . 

also , some of the jokes can be seen coming from a mile away . 

still , smith keeps the zingers coming at a sufficiently rapid pace . 

among the actors , fiorentino and rickman stand out by far . 

fiorentino virtually by herself gives the film emotional weight . 

damon and affleck are fairly lackluster . 

rock and hayek exist in the film pretty much only as comic relief as are mews and smith . 

but the latter duo fare much better because jay and silent bob , who recur in all of smith's movies , are much more in line with smith's brand of humor . 

bud cort , george carlin , janeane garofalo , guinevere turner , and alanis morissette all make cameo appearances . 
"
"well , what are you going to expect ? 

it's a movie about a big snake that eats people . 

that's what i should have been thinking when i viewed this film , because maybe then i would have enjoyed myself more . 

instead , i ended up wishing a giant snake would come along and eat me , too . 

anaconda is about a documentary film crew sailing down a south american river . 

led by anthropologists dr . steven cale ( eric stolz ) and terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) , the crew is attempting to locate a lost tribe of natives . 

along the way , they find poacher paul sarone ( jon voight ) , and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda . 

to simply say that this is the world's largest snake wouldn't be doing it justice , since the anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide . 

if this isn't a good reason to avoid picking up hitchhikers , i don't know what is . 

at the beginning of anaconda , we find that flores and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past , but that seems to be more or less over now . 

i expected that fact to play a key part somewhere down the line , but it ended up being a set-up for nothing . 

cale chokes on a deadly wasp ( don't ask me how that happens - i don't know ) and is put out of action , relegated to being the person whom the rest of the film crew must get back to civilization for medical help . 

this minimally helps to add a sense of urgency for the plot , since this goal now comes in direct conflict with sarone's plan to capture the snake . 

however , this is negated by the fact that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film , and in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle . 

most bad characters are either annoying or stupid . 

in this movie , they're both . 

since this description applies to all the characters except sarone , it's hard to find someone to root for . 

you're supposed to back the good guys , but you really end up cheering for sarone because he's smarter than everyone else . 

or maybe he's just not as dumb as everyone else . 

at times , i almost found myself rooting for the snake . 

there are no standout performances here . 

everyone seems to be reciting lines written for stock characters . 

even voight appears to be doing his best impression of christopher walken for some reason . 

no matter , as in most monster movies , the snake is supposed to be the real star anyway . 

in most of the scenes , the snake is computer generated , and the effects crew did a decent job of making it look real . 

however , the realism is thrown off by some pretty unrealistic occurrences . 

sometimes , for example , the snake just moves too fast . 

it catches a guy jumping off of a waterfall , for crying out loud . 

then there's another scene where the snake eats one of the characters , and we see the snake's skin drawn so tightly over its prey that we can see the victim's pained expression from within the snake's belly . 

absolutely ridiculous . 

a testimony to the film's bad direction is the inclusion of a scene early on the in the film , where we get to see just how dangerous the mighty anaconda is . 

in a scene totally unrelated to anything else , we are witness to the big snake winning a showdown with a panther . 

the anaconda wraps itself around the powerful feline as if it were a stuffed animal and squeezes it so hard , one of the panther's eyeballs pops out . 

eeeewwwww . 

above and beyond the sick factor , however , this scene surprised me because it actually showed the face of the snake before a quarter of the movie had even passed . 

in films like these , a sense of mystery surrounding the monster must be maintained . 

if the characters are reacting to something they fear more than see , we as an audience must experience that feeling along with them . 

to show us the monster early on is to let us in on something the characters don't know about , and therefore allow us to get used to the danger before the pivotal moment when man and beast have their climactic showdown . 

in a case like that , the showdown just ends up being a letdown . 

when i saw the snake for the first time , i decided to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume that the snake i saw wasn't the real danger . 

this one was just a decoy , and there was actually a bigger snake waiting to make its appearance just when everyone thought they were safe . 

no such luck . 

okay , maybe anaconda is actually a decoy , and there's really a better movie waiting to make its debut .

"starring ben stiller , elizabeth hurley , maria bello , janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz , based on the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz 

permanent midnight is a pretty bad movie , though it took me a few days to conclude this . 

the film is more masturbatory than bleak , with its main character intent on confounding us with his stupidity . 

 ( he has a $6000 a week drug habit . ) 

ultimately , as adapted by veloz , jerry stahl comes off as one of those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age of twelve ; you are less mystified by his self-destructive nature than bored into a stupor yourself . 

ben stiller plays stahl , a young author who arrives in l . a . with ambition and a nasty drug habit . 

he eventually gets a gig for $5000/week writing for a sitcom called mr . chompers ( a thinly veiled stand-in for "" alf "" : chompers looks just like alf except he's blue ) , marries a producer ( hurley ) so she can get a green card , and hooks up with a spanish mother ( liz torres ) , who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons . 

insert proverbial downward spiral here . 

permanent midnight is structured mostly as a flashback , with recovering addict bello meeting stiller ( at a fastfood restaurant , where stiller works the drive-thru as part of rehab ) , taking him back to a hotel , and between bouts of serious screwing , listening to his life story . 

i've spent the last week trying to figure out why stiller never seemed to find the frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive-worse , i've been trying to figure out why hurley did find stiller attractive . 

as stahl , stiller displays none of the charm or wit one would expect ( post-there's something about mary ) of either the actor or a comedy writer . 

what separates stahl from the hundreds of other hollywood punk-junkies , it seems , is that stahl wrote a book about his idiocy . 

watch stahl shoot heroin next to a baby ! 

watch stahl spoil numerous pitch meetings with smack-fueled babble ! 

stiller gives a technically flawless performance : the film could double as a documentary on how to be a junkie . 

but permanent midnight is mostly soulless . 

when the movie poses the question will stahl be saved ? 

and then answers it in the form of bello's character ( basically a shrink in black panties ) , could a person care less ? 

in the film version of his autobiography of the same name , stahl doesn't need saving , he needs someone who will sit there and listen to him go on about himself . 

if you learn anything about the other characters in this movie , it's that they are the most incredibly tolerant hollywood-types known to man . 

 ( stahl also seems to be the only person at schmooze parties doing drugs . 

is this hollywood . . . california ? ) 

i learned very little about the entertainment business from permanent midnight and a whole lot about an egotistical lunkhead . 

of course you know that stahl triumphed because he lived to talk about his problems . 

so , basically , his drug habit got him a book deal , a movie based on his life , and now he's apparently collaborating with stiller on future projects . 

so much for the moral of that story . 

temporary midnight is more like it .

" "" battlefield earth "" is the best comedy of the year . 

it has to be . 

the other prospect is just too horrifying to consider . 

bad movie syndrome struck me again , so after witnessing how much "" battlefield earth "" has been proclaimed a train wreck in both critical and popular circles , i felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster first-hand . 

is it as bad as advertised ? 

oh yes , very much so . 

the plot is incomprehensible . 

the acting is atrocious . 

the special effects are mediocre . 

the action is dull . 

the implausibilities are legion . 

the dialogue is cringe-inducing . 

the whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny . 

i don't even want to continue reviewing this movie ; i'd like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible , but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory , so here it is : 

the premise is basically a rip-off of "" planet of the apes , "" only minus the apes and philosophical discussion , and plus a race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo . 

the year is 3000 , the psychlos have conquered earth , and the human population has been enslaved . 

only a handful of humans escaped to radiation-rich areas to escape the aliens ; they live out their lives in fear . 

one man , johnny goodboy ( i know , i know ) tyler ( barry pepper ) , ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos . 

there he confronts the psychlo head of security : a big , ugly , klingon-looking creature called terl ( john travolta ) . 

pressed into slavery , johnny vows to lead a revolution and take the planet back . 

meanwhile , terl is faced with his own problems : he has recently learned that he's stuck living on earth ( which he hates ) for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big man's daughter . 

he decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology ( this is where the plot gets ridiculous . 

 . 

 . ) 

so the "" man-animal "" can lead a mining expedition into places the psychlos can't go . 

terl then plans to keep the mined gold for himself . 

of course , his plan doesn't work . 

so many things wrong with this movie -- where to begin ? 

how about with travolta , whose hollywood clout brought about this , the cinematic version of scientology guru l . ron hubbard's sci-fi novel ? 

early previews for "" battlefield earth , "" with constant shots of a makeup-laden travolta cackling like lex luthor , had me ( and several audience members ) remarking , "" what the hell is travolta thinking ? "" 

the movie did nothing to stem such remarks . 

all that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here : terl cackles after nearly every line , and so does every other psychlo . 

of course , this makes every scene hilariously overwrought , no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary . 

the psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america , but ceos generally don't laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees . 

 ( "" you were going to be promoted -- but now you're not ! 

fwahahahahahahahaha ! ! ! ! ! "" ) 

it's no big surprise terl loses to the humans -- he's an idiot . 

he breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book . 

he underestimates his enemies , assuming he'll win just because he's smarter . 

 ( he uses the word "" leverage "" like some sort of scientologist mantra . ) 

not content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero , he hooks him up to a machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos' language and technology . 

 ( why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me . ) 

he then appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him . 

no wonder this guy never got his promotion . 

the plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention . 

why do the psychlos build an earth base in which both they and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive ? 

how come the psychlos are wasting their time mining for gold when the doors of fort knox are wide open ? 

how in the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in a hangar for 1 , 000 years ? 

and how do all these previously brain-dead cavemen learn to fly them so quickly ? 

there's a whole lot more to scratch one's head about in "" battlefield earth . "" 

bring a scorecard to track the plot holes . 

director roger christian shoots "" battlefield earth "" in the most distracting way possible , tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason . 

all the characters appear to be standing on the walls , and it's awfully difficult to watch a movie when you must tilt your head just to watch ordinary passages of dialogue . 

the action sequences are atrociously edited , every one turned into an endless slow-motion parade that drains all potential excitement . 

are these things really so hard to construct ? 

my respect for supposed "" lightweight "" action directors has grown by leaps and bounds after witnessing in "" battlefield earth "" how badly an action sequence can be shot . 

this movie is an absolute headache . 

it's not just the shot selection and editing ; the movie , quite frankly , makes no sense . 

for most of "" battlefield earth's "" running time , i just didn't know what was happening . 

it didn't have anything to do with me finding the events stupid or illogical ( though they certainly are ) -- i really had no idea what the hell was going on . 

when i pieced the plot together later , it didn't look any better . 

here's how much of a disaster this is : "" battlefield earth "" is already the worst movie of the year , and it's going to take something really , really inept to top it . 

the only thing we can take comfort in about the film is that no one will be suckered into joining the church of scientology because of it . 

in fact , i'd think that hubbard's cult would want to distance themselves from this bomb as fast as possible . 

that'll teach me to give into bad movie syndrome again . 
"
"bruce willis is a type-casted actor . 

in die hard , he played john mcclaine , a rough and tough chicago cop who gets caught in the wrong place at the wrong time . 

again , in pulp fiction , as butch coolidge , an over-the-hill boxer , he steps on the wrong guys toes . 

in luc besson's the fifth element , willis plays korben dallas , a new york cabby who takes in the wrong passenger at the worst possible time . 

a stylish science fiction epic , the fifth element's complex plot begins right away , in the deserts of egypt ( think stargate ) in 1914 . 

an enormous spacecraft lands above a pyramid where the "" 5 elements "" are stored and takes them away , vowing to return them when the evil comes back . 

cut to present day , which is our future . 

the year is 2023 , and new york is the city . 

the only basic differences between besson's futuristic depiction and the real life new york is that the smog is thicker , the buildings are higher , and the traffic floats ! 

anyway , the "" evil "" comes back as a ball of fire to wreak havoc on the fair citizens of the earth , so back come the tortoise-like aliens to return the "" 5 elements "" to earth , in order to defend themselves against the "" evil . "" 

in the process , however , the ship is intercepted by 2 fighter pods and is destroyed before landing . 

when officials arrive at the site , all that remains is a hand . 

what can you do with a hand ? 

hey , its the 21st century here-dna reconstruction ! 

this hand turns out to belong to a beautiful , but mysterious woman named leeloo ( milla jovovich , dazed and confused ) . 

she escapes and , attempting to escape the police by swan diving off of an enormous skyscraper and crashing through the roof of korben's floating cab . 

it's love at first site , as korben and leeloo elude the lazy-as-always cops . 

when leeloo begins mumbling about a cornelius ( ian holm , night falls on manhattan ) , korben searches the "" yellow pages "" and delivers her to the door of the good reverend , the only man who knows of her background and duties . 

now , korben , leeloo , and cornelius must journey to a foreign planet to board a cruise ship ( special effects were spectacular here ) to find the remaining four elements . 

it is here , where they discover that they have been followed by the evil jean-baptiste emmanuel zorg ( gary oldman , murder in the first ) . 

he , too , wants possession of the elements , as do a group of pig-like warriors ( think the gamorreans in return of the jedi ) . 

in a spectacular ending , with time running out , leeloo is faced with a problem-why should she save a people who live to destroy each other ? 

the question is a good one , and one that could be pondered . 

but enough of that . 

when korben points out his love for her , leeloo is inclined to become the "" 5th element "" and save the world from total destruction . 

the fifth element features good performances by willis and holm , an excellent portrayal of a comedic villain ( who reminded me a lot of jack nicholson's the joker in batman ) by one of the masters of villainy , oldman , and a heartfelt offering by relative newcomer jovovich . 

the supporting cast , which includes brion james ( tango & cash ) , tim "" tiny "" lester ( no holds barred ) , luke perry ( buffy the vampire slayer ) , and chris tucker ( friday ) , added a comedic effect to the film . 

although besson's the fifth element can be criticized for the outlandish use of cliches , it is a solid motion picture with a definite point . 

some other directors ( like anaconda's luis llosa ) should take a lesson from this guy-using ideas from epic motion pictures the right way . 

ideas from star wars and stargate were utilized for the improvement of this film . 

sci-fi fan or not , any movie-lover should see this wonderfully stylish motion picture .

"
"lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode 4 : episode 1 is a boring , empty spectacle that features some nice special effects . 

after the familiar 'a long time ago . . . . ' 

opening , the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game . 

the plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo , ruled by queen amidala ( portman ) jedi knights qui-gon ( neeson ) and obi wan ( mcgregor ) are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade . 

however , this simple blockade is not all it seems , and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers , including facing the evil darth maul ( ray park . ) 

they also meet the future darth vadar , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) 

star wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking : script , direction and characters . 

the script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic . 

the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star , and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more non-existent . 

there's no underlying tension , and no urgent need to see what the outcome is . 

the film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story , which doesn't help . 

there's no snap to make the film work , it moves at a plod . 

the script is boring : all the characters speak in morals , especially anakins mother . 

there's no group spirit evident here , and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders , it's evident that not much is going to happen . 

the two leads are hideously boring , static characters given little to do and too much time to do it . 

qui-gon and obi-wan hold no presence on film , and give little for the audience to root for . 

the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul , if he had been given more screen time . 

maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history , even if he does provide the only 'straight' plot line in the film ( all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy . ) 

anakin is annoying and unlikeable . , 

instead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended . 

it's probably not surprising that his hateful little boy , unfortunately blessed 'ani' by everyone he knows , joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible . 

the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks , although in the end none is provided in the film by him . 

although his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys , the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny . 

the only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a 'pod' racer , because i knew he wouldn't be able to talk for a while . 

queen amidala is a nothing in the film , she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must 'serve her people , ' and go goo-goo over anakin . 

again , her role will become more important in the later episodes , and is given little to do here . 

the actors don't help the movie much either . 

liam neeson seems bored and embarrassed , and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible . 

mcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy , with little charm . 

the casting director must have chose him because he's scottish like alec guinness : there's little other explanation for it . 

natalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script , but she delivers a spunky performance . 

and jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice . 

there's very little talent evident with him , it's hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there . 

he's not even very 'cute . ' 

the main claim of the film , the special effects , are okay . 

there's nothing impressive about them , yet they complement the story well . 

the cgi takes away much of the human element , however . 

the battle droids for example , the replacement for the stormtroopers , are characterless little computer graphics , lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers . 

episode 1 is just disappointing . 

it's got high production values , but little else . 

the music is meandering , except near the end . 

the plot gives us no-one to root for , or even care for . 

the effects are nice , but dull . 

the plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should . 

there's an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair , and many clich ? s are catered for throughout the film . 

apart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence , episode 1 is a dry affair that serves little purpose , except to make money and to get us to watch episode 2 to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film . 

disappointing is barely the word .

"in tim burton's `sleepy hollow' , there is a mysterious headless horseman who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name . 

he rides a beautiful black steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the wound of his victims with an immediate swipe . 

burton's update on washington irving's classic tale of `the legend of sleepy hollow' offers us the mystery of the horseman , when the screenplay should have merely settled on the aspect of the horror . 

writer andrew kevin walker ( `seven' ) throws in perhaps too healthy a dosage of sherlock holmes , but the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing , as burton offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and stirring to examine . 

as `sleepy hollow' opens , we're greeted with a juicy cameo from martin landau , who won an oscar in burton's `ed wood' . 

landau plays a prominent citizen of sleepy hollow , who , on a fateful carriage ride through the forest , is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider . 

after two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town , constable ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is sent in to investigate . 

landlord baltus von tassel ( michael gambon ) explains to crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case , and that they believe the murderer is a dead hessian trooper ( played briefly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken ) who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods . 

crane is not a man of great superstition , and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets ( things i was not surprised to find in a tim burton movie ) . 

first and foremost , `sleepy hollow' is a fun horror film . 

as with virtually all burton movies , we are treated to a wonderful score by composer danny elfman , who has once again poured excitement and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly . 

the horseman f/x are stylish and impressive , particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors . 

but why did i enjoy `sleepy hollow' as much as i did ? 

although enjoyable , it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore that spurted left and right . . 

it was the light comic touch that burton applied . 

the film has the sweetness of a candy apple , usually channeled through depp's wonderful performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane , who is no longer a mild-mannered school teacher but still attains his cowardly qualities . 

this is certainly not the only alteration that's been made . 

as the film progresses , it becomes apparent that walker is more concerned with the mystery of the murders than the murders themselves . 

the momentum is slowed considerably once crane begins piecing the mystery together , because for the audience , it's not an issue we particularly wish to be solved . 

it's more effective for the headless horseman to be an elusive demon than an elusive demon with an ulterior motive . 

still , we are still captivated by the breathtaking technical detail and burton's keen eye to capture our attention . 

the costuming is exceptional , and the dialogue is crisp and effective throughout ( it's recognizable that the script was refined by award-winning playwright tom stoppard ) . 

the supporting cast exhibits more color and playfulness than many . 

a blonde christina ricci is in fine form as von tassel's daughter katrina , and an unlikely romance between she and ichabod is surprisingly consistent . 

walken , michael gough ( who appeared in burton's `batman' films ) and miranda richardson are all enjoyable in tackling their separate roles . 

i suppose the strengths behind `sleepy hollow' lie within the central trio : director burton , constable depp and the headless horseman who hunts him down with ruthless accuracy . 

all of this is not to be taken seriously , of course . 

`sleepy hollow' is a lavish , frightening and altogether amusing reworking of a classic tale that many people cherished as children . 

if you've got a decent head on your shoulders , you'll have the good sense to gallop off to the theater and enjoy it one last time .

"cashing in on the success of white men can't jump and the failure of most of their solo vehicles ( including the cowboy way and drop zone ) , wesley snipes and woody harrelson have reteamed , hoping that they can strike up the same success . 

sadly , if this dismal , cliche ridden and mind-numbingly boring action pic is anything to go by , they haven't got a chance in hell of even coming close . 

this time out , the duo play foster brothers who are transit cops . 

following several run-ins with their tyrannical boss ( robert blake ) , who is obsessed with the "" money train "" --a train which carries all the subway's takings--and will let nothing stop it ( now * there's * an original plot device ) , harrelson's character decides to try and take off with the cash . 

along the way , both of them fall in love with the same woman--another transit cop who also hates her boss . 

this leads to the typical sibling rivalry crap that you usually find in a film of this standard ( 'you were always the better brother' etc . etc . etc . ) , and doesn't help to add anything to the film . 

given a better script , better performers in supporting roles and a shorter running time ( the film almost went for two hours--or did it just feel like it ? ) , this film might ( and i mean * might * ) have turned out okay , but as it is , it is stocked with the worst action film cliches , whose only purpose appears to be to pad the film out to its painfully long running time . 

robert blake , who plays the evil boss , has got to be the most pathetic bad guy in film history ! 

he sounds like wayne newton , and appears to think the best way to appear evil is to have your eyes bulging as though they are about to burst out of their sockets ! 

but this is only one of money train's problems . 

if you look at the script as if it was an action film , it lacks originality and suspense . 

but if you try to look at it as if it were a heist film , it is even worse . 

the final robbery sequence is almost trivialised and the characters definitely ain't butch and sundance . 

the film isn't all bad though . 

snipes and harrelson , when they aren't using the dumb cliches that the script gives them , make an agreeable duo , and some of the stunt-work is indeed excellent . 

but good stunt-work cannot save a bottom-of-the-barrel action movie . 

if you're a really undemanding action freak , there's a chance you'll like this . 

but if you're looking for something original , or suspenseful , try somewhere else--i doubt you'll find it here .

"my first press screening of 1998 and already i've gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list . 

what an auspicious beginning ! 

welcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l . a . and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere . 

firestorm , the directorial debut of dances with wolves's academy award winning cinematographer dean semler , is the first of the new year's crop of movies . 

as our story opens , the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are "" smokejumpers . "" 

we then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl , where one of the gung-ho guys is taking a romance quiz from "" cosmopolitan . "" 

having the time of their lives , they then jump into the middle of a burning forest . 

when , even in the beginning , the director can't get the small parts right , you can sense the movie is in trouble . 

with the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasoline-filled cars , smokejumper monica ( christianne hirt ) tells them to get away from their soon-to-explode vehicles . 

not bothering to shout nor even get close to them , she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people . 

miraculously , they manage to hear her and move away . 

in a movie that specializes in cheap shots , the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building . 

as it does throughout , overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f . windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl's face . 

our show's two heroes , the crew's chief , wynt perkins , played laconically by scott glenn , and his second-in-command , jesse graves , played by howie long in a weak attempt to be the next steven seagal , enter the burning house looking for the little girl . 

in a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames . 

the manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse . 

this mawkish show cuts back to monica , who has a life-or-death decision to make . 

the chopper with the fire-retardant chemicals has only enough to save one group . 

will it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monica's two firefighting buddies ? 

she has only seconds to decide who will be saved . 

yes , she goes for the majority , but , miracle of miracles , the other three come out alive anyway . 

not content with a traditional firefighting story , chris soth's screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape . 

 ( "" hoods in the woods , "" is what the "" ground-pounders "" yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire . ) 

along the way , shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis , who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father , who was a marine drill instructor . 

most of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing . 

he flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck . 

arguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside . 

using a ramp , he shoots straight out of the top of the building's attic , and when he hits the ground , he just rides off in a cloud of dust . 

when the film isn't using some stock footage of actual forest fires , the simulated ones look hokey . 

editor jack hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions . 

the ending , with its sick twists , manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie . 

perhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby , "" it's not as bad as some of the television sitcoms . "" 

firestorm runs mercifully just 1 : 29 . 

it is rated r for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers .

"all great things come to an end , and the dot-com era embodies that perfectly . 

beneath a mound of bankruptcy paperwork lies the remains of a former dot-com darling , the company kozmo . com , 

an online convenience store stocked with ice cream , porn videos , and other basic necessities of a urban dweller , all hand-delivered by couriers within an hour . 

designed in 1997 by two college roommates -- joseph parks , a 27 year old goldman sachs banker , and yong kang - kozmo flamed out in three short years , raising more than $280 million in venture capital funding and from partnerships with such bigwigs as starbucks and amazon . com . 

by december 1999 , the company boasted 4 , 000 employees in 11 cities , its barking ceo park attracting all kinds of media attention . 

the company was set for an ipo in may 2000 . . . 

until april 14 , 2000 , the day the stock market took its first big dive , ending the internet era . 

by april 13 , 2001 , kozmo was out of money and ceased operations . 

unlike the earlier , similar documentary startup . com , which chronicled the rise and fall of another dot-com , govworks , e-dreams focuses both on its original founders , especially park , and on the common folks that ran the day-to-day operations . 

the contrast is amazing , showing how a cult persona can convince anyone that any idea is the next big thing . 

the film's director , wonsuk chin ( too tired to die ) , expertly juxtaposes upper management company meetings with on-the-spot interviews with the bike messengers , general managers , and floor staff that kept kozmo humming . 

the film's images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise . 

the most satisfying part of the film comes in understanding , to a degree , the expectations of numerous ceos commanding these titanic-type businesses . 

in the film's final interviews with park , we learn what happens when the money dries up and backers don't return phone calls . 

in the end , the name of the game was profit , and if you couldn't make money , even the dreamers got the axe .

"you know that a movie has issues when most everyone in the audience comes out laughing . . . and 

it's not a comedy ! 

and what a strange career path for director chuck russell . 

he starts his career off with a decent take on the "" nightmare on elm street "" series with his debut as director on installment number three . 

he follows that up with the blob the very next year , but waits another six years to do his next piece , a little film called the mask starring jim carrey , and then one more star vehicle in eraser two years after that . 

so then he thought , "" let me wait another five years , get a weak script jammed with cliches and hope that jimmy smits and kim basinger could pull it out of its ashes "" ? ! ? 

strange dude and one crappy flick . 

plot : a six-year old girl is believed to be some kind of mysterious prophet sent down from god . 

a satanic cult wants the girl to switch over to their side , while the girl's aunt wants to . . . well , 

save her from those damn devil worshippers ! 

enter one occult expert agent , plenty of bobo cops and lots of nuns praying , and you've just about got the gist of things here . 

critique : with plot holes the size of my ass , this movie barely squeezes any sense out of its clich ? -ridden plot , with wasted talent , cheezy effects , bad dialogue and unintentional laughs to boot . 

what's good about this movie ? 

well , rufus sewell is pretty fun to watch as the head of a creepy runaway children's shelter/satanist supreme , with seriously wicked eyes and just enough ham in his performance to go with all of the cheese lying around . 

the little girl is also pretty good but unfortunately her character doesn't really do all that much . 

and believe it or not , i was actually enjoying some of the film's first half hour , which starts off with some promise , but not before bonehead moves after bonehead moves from our protagonist , basinger , just drown the film's entire basis of believability . 

for some reason , it takes her more time than anyone to figure out that her niece is gifted , and even longer to figure out that every move that she makes . . . is 

a dumb one ! 

add that to the entire police force of incompetents , save for jimmy smits ( whose talent agent advised him that playing the exact same cop character from nypd blue would be a good career move ? 

at least change the clothes , jimmy ! ) , zero scares , zero thrills and even less actual drama , and you've got yourself a pretty bad movie . 

and why would respected actors like christina ricci and ian holm take bit parts in this movie ? 

did they owe the director a favor or something ? 

together , they barely have five minutes of screen time , but i suppose that ricci's hospital room scene might be worth a look for some of you horn-dogs . 

the worst part about this movie is its hilariously unbelievable ending , which features police officers coming up with the brilliant idea of "" sneaking up "" on a man's house , who they know to be guilty of a crime ! 

uuuhmm . . . how's 

about knocking on the door and arresting his sorry ass , officers ? ! 

anyway , i don't usually inscribe spoilers in my reviews but the stupidity of some of these characters is just too difficult to describe without validating it with solid idiotic proof ( and there was plenty to go around ) . 

and did basinger lose some of her acting "" talent "" during her hiatus from the profession after her 1997 oscar win ? 

difficult to say if it was her lines that were really bad , or if she just delivered them poorly . 

either way , little originality , very obvious computer effects , little thrills , little drama and very little entertainment value , certainly bestow the honor of one of the worst movies of the summer upon this film . 

but if you really don't mind a rehashed gobbledygook of various satanic and "" kid "" -based thrillers , and enjoy watching films that don't bring anything new to the table . . . well , 

drink some beers , smoke some beans and rent this video , because it may just be one of the funnier thrillers of the year .

"disconnect the phone line . 

don't accept the charges . 

do anything you can to avoid the wretched , melodramatic sisterhood dramedy `hanging up' . 

i figured i needed to get in touch with my feminine side , and `hanging up' seemed like an ideal opportunity to do so . 

the film features an incredible palate of female talent , and the capability behind the camera brought to mind such sparkling gems as `sleepless in seattle' and `unsung heroes' . 

meg ryan , diane keaton and lisa kudrow play a trio of sisters who , once separated by career judgments over family ties , must reunite when their father ( walter matthau ) is admitted into the hospital with alzheimer's disease . 

while this may read like an optimum opportunity to rekindle their relationship and reflect with poignancy on the past , the script by sisters delia and nora ephron is exasperating , shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery . 

`hanging up' has the overall effect of a tele-marketer pestering you for two hours , while you don't have the option of doing as the title suggests . 

for the first half-hour , the ephron sisters use telephone conversations for a basis of character development . 

this is an annoying and ineffective device . 

cell-phones ring every five minutes , and everyone hurriedly rushes along , leaving marginal time for the frustrated viewer to relate to the sisters' issues and problems . 

if `hanging up' was an apple pie , then i felt as if we were getting the mere crust of the story . 

granted , there are a few genuine and sincere moments in the film . 

but they only help to establish that the remainder of the strained emotions are nothing but inferior dramatic muck . 

the most outrageous strategy in `hanging up' is that , after a series of largely unrealized attempts at character development , we are expected to exhibit compassion and courtesy toward the sisters as they join for a melodramatic finale . 

we are able to identify with eve ( ryan ) , the most open and caring daughter , because she is the one who stayed by her father's side as everyone else moved forward to pursue a impending career . 

georgia ( keaton ) , the eldest daughter , is celebrating the fifth year anniversary of her magazine called . . . . 

`georgia' . 

maddy ( kudrow ) , the soap opera actress , spends time either contemplating her possible path to stardom or nursing her dog . 

ryan's convincing performance and diverting cuteness are two of the more agreeable aspects of `hanging up' . 

kudrow , so delightfully eccentric as the off-kilter airhead phoebe in `friends' , is totally wasted . 

ditto for keaton , who is serving a double shift as co-star and director - a time slot that can be a difficult priority juggle . 

her frenzy is apparent . 

for a chick flick , there is a distressing lack of chuckles . 

the reliable matthau is reduced to chaotic shtick that , given his character's situation , seems more depressing than amusing . 

even so , the peak form of humor in `hanging up' is represented by some of matthau's nasty quips and ryan's eternal battle to have the aforementioned pooch swallow a pill . 

that about accounts for the three or four chuckles you will expel during the film . 

my curiosity has suddenly been tweaked to discover how such a promising and star-studded approach could turn so viciously sour . 

but really , it's no mystery . 

the predictable , melodramatic filth that is `hanging up' is certainly not the fault of these actresses . 

pin it on the screenplay , which attempts to clear up vital issues in three or four minutes , while spending the rest of the running time in an annoying flurry of phone conversations . 

it's certainly a far cry from what one would label as a rewarding experience , but `hanging up' should have at least been enjoyable . 

uh-uh . 

it's a wrong number from the beginning . 
"
"all feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos , please raise your hands . 

thank you for identifying yourselves ; now would you all please go away . 

your influence has to rank as one of the most annoying trends in filmmaking in the last decade , and it shows no sign of abating any time soon . 

it isn't just the strobe light quality of your twenty-cuts-per-minute editing , or the numbing over-use of popular music artists on the soundtracks which makes me suspicious of any film advertised "" featuring the music of . . . "" no , it is a kind of cynicism you have perfected , banking on the idea that no one will care about the lack of a story if you include enough bells and whistles . 

welcome to the club , scott kalvert . 

your adaptation of the basketball diaries is loud and one-dimensional , serving only as the vehicle for a performance by leonardo dicaprio that is better in pieces than it is as a whole . 

dicaprio stars as jim carroll , the new york poet/songwriter/ performer on whose autobiographical writings the film is based . 

as the film opens , jim is a budding high school basketball star given to petty thievery and getting drunk with buddies mickey ( mark wahlberg ) , pedro ( james madio ) and neutron ( patrick mcgaw ) . 

one night , jim graduates from inhalants to cocaine , and shortly thereafter to heroin . 

jim's addiction to the drug starts him on a downhill spiral , as he is kicked off the basketball team by his coach ( bruno kirby ) , kicked out of his home by his mother ( lorraine bracco ) , and drops out of school . 

along with mickey and pedro , jim becomes a victim of the street , living from fix to fix and sinking lower and lower . 

the basketball diaries has been bouncing around as a project for years , but the sticking point has always been that jim carroll as a character was too unsympathetic and too much a loner . 

screenwriter bryan goluboff created the three characters who act as carroll's posse , resulting in a jim carroll who is just as unsympathetic , but now with equally unsympathetic friends . 

as a film , the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as a cautionary tale , a 100 minute long "" just say no "" public service announcement , but as drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is impossible to care much about anyone in the movie . 

jim is sort of a jerk even before he becomes a junkie , but i suppose that his pseudo-sensitive poetry and his devotion to his terminally ill friend are intended to balance that out . 

perhaps we are expected to see jim as one of those "" good kids who falls in with the wrong crowd "" that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be ; i saw him simply as part of the bad crowd . 

without a character who changes in any appreciable way , the basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into a collection of crimes committed by jim and his strung-out cohorts , all choreographed to an oppressively loud soundtrack . 

director scott kalvert doesn't have many scenes with intrinsic dramatic impact with which to work , so he substitutes silly slow-motion photography , self-consciously funky camera angles and choppy editing . 

on only one occasion , when a steady pan around a room where jim is trying to detox makes it appear that the walls are closing in , are any of the gimmicks effective . 

mostly , they just draw attention to how hollow the story is . 

they also don't allow leonardo dicaprio's performance to be as strong as it could have been . 

for every impressive moment , like his desperate attempt to get his mother to give him money , there is a scene where kalvert pulls too much of the focus to his own camera theatrics . 

dicaprio is most effective when he is playing off other actors , particularly a fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an ex-junkie who tries to help jim straighten out , but kalvert won't let character interaction define this story . 

he wants to turn dicaprio into a rock star , shooting him in dramatic fashion but denying him the opportunity to do much acting . 

at isolate moments , the basketball diaries is a fine showcase for dicaprio's talents . 

far more frequently , it looks like kalvert is trying to imagine what a long form velvet underground video might have looked like .

"billy crystal reappears in yet another high concept comedy . 

he tries to infuse some life into it , but it gets bogged down with sentimentality and a lack of sophistication . 

sammy ( billy crystal ) is a struggling agent at the end of his ropes . 

he's separated from his wife , serena ( kathleen quinlan ) , and down to his last serious client . . . in a low-budget film shooting in romania . 

but in a turn of bad luck , sammy wrecks his car . . . only 

to be mysteriously saved by a giant ( gheorghe muresan ) . 

but this giant has a heart of gold . 

he leads a solitary life , helping out the monks at a local monastery . 

his only longing is for his long lost love , lilianna ( joanna pacula ) , who has since moved to america . 

sammy , seeing a golden ticket , convinces max to become an actor ( represented by sammy , of course ) , and come back to america . 

and so sam and max bounce from pathetic job to pathetic job , with sammy dangling a meeting with lilianna as a carrot before max's nose . 

but slowly sammy's deceptions begin to haunt him . 

but will he develop a conscience before the innocent max becomes disillusioned . 

the humor in my giant isn't the world's greatest . 

mostly , it falls under the category of "" boy . . . he's 

so big ! "" , 

and that can only go so far , no matter how hard the talent tries . 

still , its slightly amusing parts are longed for when the movie gets bogged down in sappy moments . 

the film's best moment ( and that's not saying much ) is a bit part by steven seagal , playing himself . 

between executive decision and this , all of seagal's best roles have been cameos . 

maybe he should consider a change of work : steven seagal , the character actor ! 

gheorghe muresan isn't a natural actor at all , and his thick cotton-mouthed accent certainly doesn't help . 

in fact the only thing he adds to the role is his immense stature . 

originally , the concept was designed several years ago for andre the giant . 

andre also had a hefty accent , but he displayed a knack for comedy in the princess bride . . . something 

muresan should have studied for some pointers . 

why does billy crystal continually get caught in these pathetic comedies ? 

he's proven that he can be much funnier than these formulaic films allow him to be , and yet , like a glutton for punishment , he keeps coming back . 

that doesn't mean we have to .

"spoiled rich kid kelley morse ( chris klein ) receives a new mercedes for a graduation present . 

he and his buddies take it for a joyride to a small nearby town , where he proceeds to torment the locals simply because he's rich and they're not . 

he ends up provoking jasper ( josh hartnett ) into a race and as a result , the local gas station and diner are destroyed when they crash into it . 

kelley is sentenced to rebuild the diner , and has to live with jasper in a spare room over his family's barn . 

jasper's girlfriend sam ( leelee sobieski ) soon takes a liking to kelley however , despite the fact that 1 ) it was her family's diner that was destroyed and b ) all kelley does is sit around , sulk , and smart off to the townspeople . 

but when she sees him sweaty and shirtless , that's apparently all she needs to lose her feelings for jasper ( whose only fault seems to be a perpetual case of hat hair ) . 

so sobieski soon falls in love with kelley , especially after the day she follows him through the woods and hears him giving his graduation speech ( which he was unable to deliver because he caused the destruction of property and nearly killed dozens of people ) . 

in the speech , kelley quotes a poem by robert frost , which just so happens to be sam's favorite poem as well . 

awwwww . 

soon they're frolicking around in the fields and for some reason waste no time letting people in town ( especially jasper's best friend ) see them together . 

kelley continues to make an ass of himself in town , especially when he shows up at the town dance , drunk and steaming because sam went with jasper . 

kelley runs off and decides to leave town . 

sam catches up to him at the bus station and he asks her to come to boston with him . 

jasper shows up and tearfully confesses to sam just how much he loves her , and sam , without even breaking stride basically says "" see ya ! "" 

and takes off to boston with kelley . 

here on earth goes in so many wrong directions from the start that by the time its fairly decent ending comes around , its completely worthless . 

chris klein and leelee sobieski are two of my current favorite young performers , and it's because of their presence that i watched this film in the first place . 

however , not long into the proceedings i wanted to just reach into the film and strangle them both . 

i shouldn't have such feelings towards people i like , but their characters are so infuriating that . . . 

well trust me , you'll feel the same way . 

even though both of the lead male characters are usually in the wrong , kelley is hands down the more unlikable of the two , simply because his jerkish actions are calculated . 

he intends to be a jackass each and every time he does it . 

jasper on the other hand , only reacts to kelley's provocations , and afterwards comes across as being truly sorry for his impulsive actions . 

but , as in life , nice guys finish last . 

for the entire film we watch sam fall in love with the guy no one likes while the film's only sympathetic character gets completely crushed . 

then , a cancer subplot comes into play ( where things get even more infuriating , if you can imagine that ) . 

what , things weren't depressing enough for you mr . screenwriter ? 

who greenlit this project ? 

who "" on earth "" thought this would entertain anyone ? 

perhaps if the film had been structured where kelley perhaps felt some remorse after he caused the destruction of property and nearly killed dozens of people . 

but even after he's destroyed these people's lives he continues to be a snob to them , and ruins one more for good measure . 

here on earth is available on dvd from fox home entertainment . 

it contains the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions . 

extras include jessica simpson's music video for "" where you are "" , a commercial for the film's soundtrack ( which by the way is the only good thing about the film ) , the original theatrical trailer and five tv spots , trailers for other fox releases ( anna and the king , anywhere but here , the beach , drive me crazy , ever after , romeo + juliet , simply irresistible ) , as well as that new fox promo touting their upcoming dvd releases that i really enjoy . 

the picture and sound quality on the disc are fine . . . 

nothing that will challenge anyone's audio/video systems of course . 

fans of this movie ( if any exist ) should enjoy the dvd release . 

here on earth is not entertaining nor is it compelling . 

no joy or entertainment value can be derived from any of the events of the film . 

it is merely a waste of time , money and talent . 
"
"expectation rating : a bit worse than expected ( mainly because i found the middle part to be a bit dull ) . 

roger ebert gave it a four star review , and while he is a critic that uses the full scale , and i often agree -- such as dark city being the best film of 1998 , he must have seen a better film . 

i read the book about five years ago and hugely enjoyed it . 

the opening of a simple plan reminded me a bit of the sweet hereafter . 

the landscape is snowy and cold , and is filmed what i feel is in a rather crisp manner ( which also reminds me of fargo ( which i loathed ) ) . 

one can almost sense the cold . 

but the movie far from the eye popping delights of the quick and the dead , instead raimi has made a more constrained film -- which probably is for the better . 

this is probably not a movie that would have been improved by lots of odd shots . 

the movie also reminded me of affliction , as the lead characters all seem to be hoping for and seeing a possibility to lead a better life than their father , and they see a chance for such a dream to come true . 

this chance is uncovered in a snow covered field , where an airplane has crash landed . 

in the plane three men find ? the american dream . . . 

in a gym bag . ? 

affliction too was set in a snowy landscape . 

it really seems very simple . 

just hold on to the money until spring , and if no one claims it , they'll be safe to spend it and their hope of experiencing the american dream can come true . 

but the snow melts , and so might several of the character's hopes . 

as in ? return to paradise ? , some of the characters are presented with a chance to do the right thing . 

but doing the right thing might not result in a better result than something more selfish . 

the movie's biggest strength is that it fact makes sense . 

i have seen many movies based on books that just seem like selected scenes from the book visualized , eschewing anything remotely resembling a coherent story -- for example clear and present danger . 

the biggest problem seems to over-familiarization with the story . 

the writer perhaps feels that he doesn't have to present scenes that are clear to him , but the lack of which only baffles an audience which has not read the book . 

this is definitely not the problem with a simple plan , even though the screenplay is by the book's author . 

the movie is always clear on where it's going , and always makes sense . 

i'm sue a lot was cut , but really i can't remember what . 

even a minor scene involving a man complaining that he has paid for too much grains is included . 

the man only comes in on mondays , but he claims that he has been charged for one purchase too many . 

turns out . . . 

well , see the movie . 

one should be warned against seeing the trailer . 

it reveals several scenes from the ending moments ( which yes , like in the book , it is a downer ) , several plot developments , and much of the beginning . 

but much of this is not spelled directly out during the trailer , so if you're lucky , you'll have forgotten about all of this when you see the movie .

"perhaps if the impostors didn't have so much going for it , it wouldn't have been such a tremendous disappointment . 

written , directed , and produced by one of its two stars , stanley tucci , whose last picture was the indie smash hit , big night , the impostors almost never catches fire . 

sputtering like a two-day old campfire , the story plays like an ad-lib sketch that was never polished or completed . 

the film's other star , oliver platt , was hilarious as the senator's aide in bulworth . 

the bloated supporting cast is a veritable cornucopia of acting talent , including woody allen , steve buscemi , hope davis , alfred molina , campbell scott , lili taylor and tony shalhoub . 

all are wasted save allen , who plays a theatrical director who stares in disbelief at the bad acting before his eyes . 

 ( the audience will easily identify with allen's sentiments . ) 

with the exception of a single original joke involving mirror-imaged subtitles , the movie engenders little genuine laughter . 

the stale humor is so embarrassingly bad that you will find yourself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it . 

the plot for the movie involves two starving actors , maurice ( oliver platt ) and arthur ( stanley tucci ) , who accidentally end up on a cruise ship . 

in order to escape an angry shakespearean actor ( alfred molina ) , who is chasing them , they dress up as ship's stewards . 

the over-the-top script has the subtlety of a sledgehammer . 

when the leads hide from their pursuers , arthur covers maurice's mouth as he suffers an unending sneeze . 

at other times , we have the typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else , while darting in and out of staterooms . 

with the film's chapters introduced like placards at a vaudeville stage , it is clear the movie wants to be taken as farce . 

the press notes describes how everyone that came on the set remarked at what a good time all of the actors were having . 

too bad they weren't more concerned with the audience's potential enjoyment . 

the jokes , frequently framed in silence , fall like stones with such intensity that one can almost hear them hitting the ground . 

one wonders if anyone ever viewed the film's dailies . 

surely , if they had , they would have realized what leaden results they were producing . 

it is tricky having good actors play bad ones , but , if they couldn't pull it off , they should have just given up . 

 "" the show is over for this fella , "" steve buscemi's character says towards the end . 

the mystery is why they didn't all give up in the beginning . 

there must have been a better script somewhere for such a wonderful cast . 

the impostors runs 1 : 42 . 

it is rated r for a little profanity and would be fine for kids around 12 and up .

" "" tina ! ! ! fetch me the axe ! ! ! "" 

a favourite book of mine called the golden turkey awards relates the story that when mommie dearest was unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in 1981 , paramount soon realised they had a problem on their hands . 

it wasn't just the film's disappointing box office performance . 

indeed , in the coming years some people would be going back to see it two , three , even six times . 

no , the main problem was that what was intended as a serious biopic of screen queen joan crawford was turning into the laugh riot of the year . 

in a desperate attempt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of events , some publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print advertisements screaming : "" mommie dearest : the biggest mommie of them all ! "" . 

executives at paramount were appalled and soon had the ads withdrawn , but it was all too late . 

mommie dearest was already cementing its place in camp cinema history . 

unfortunately , faye dunaway's energetic , at times ridiculously over-the-top performance is about the film's only redeeming feature . 

based on daughter christina crawford's trashy biography , mommie dearest chronicles a series of mainly private events in the life of her moviestar mother . 

if you believe this movie , it was a life was racked by obsession , lonliness , child abuse and rampant egomania . 

the film begins with crawford adopting two children , and concludes in the office of her lawyer where her now grown-up daughter and son find out they have been left out of their mother's will . 

joan always wanted her kids to be able to fend for themselves , you see . 

but that's about the only thread in the narrative that manages to survive to the film's end . 

the script - laboured over by four writers , a bad sign in itself - is a poorly connected series of episodes that builds little dramatic momentum . 

frank perry's direction is no more than competent , and dunaway's bitchy lines aside , the dialogue is flat and uninvolving . 

in fairness , the film's second half ditches some of the cartoon hysterics and does develop a degree empathy for its characters . 

when the adult christina moves out of home into her own modest dwelling , joan visits and keeps in touch , not helping her financially but encouraging christina's own acting and career ambitions . 

crawford does seem to care about her daughter , but you can sense the emotional distance and feel some of their pain . 

you also get glimpses of what the film could have been in the hands of better writers . 

ah , but there is dunaway's performance . 

and what a delicious piece of campery it often is . 

having just been sacked by her studio after a run of box office duds , crawford storms home late at night and proceeds to go ballistic in the garden . 

she has the maid drag the kids out of bed to come down and clean up the mess she's making . 

spotting a young tree she doesn't like the look of , she turns to the trembling christina and utters the immortal line "" tina ! ! 

fetch me the axe ! ! "" 

with which she proceeds to enthusiastically dismember the poor sapling . 

in the film's most outrageous scene , joan realises that some of her daughter's clothes are hanging on wire coat hangers . 

oh dear ! 

sounds like the perfect excuse for another temper tantrum , doesn't it ? 

this time she gives her daughter a horrible beating while delivering another classic outburst : "" no . . . wire . . . hangers . . . . ever ! ! ! ! "" . 

and later , when the board of her late husband's company pepsi cola tries to divest her of her directorship , she displays a superb grasp of business etiquette by jumping to her feet and roaring : "" don't fuck with me , fellas ! ! "" . 

oh joy ! 

something of a camp classic , then , but if that's not you're cup of tea then mommie dearest doesn't have too much to recommend it . 

better you see the real crawford in the women ( 1939 ) , mildred pierce ( 1945 ) or whatever happened to baby jane ( 1962 ) . 

great films distinguished by great performances , and a far more eloquent testament to this great woman than frank perry's shrieking piece of tabloid froth .

"any movie that kills emilio estevez off in the first fifteen minutes has something going for it . 

unfortunately , this and the familiar theme music are the only worthwhile things about mission impossible , directed by brian depalma . 

the first problem is that this film has absolutely no connection with the tv show whatsoever , aside from the music . 

the tv show was about an impossible mission force whose deft teamwork , orchestrated by jim phelps , allowed them to counfound evil dictators of mythic banana republics from inflicting their sordid schemes upon the world . 

teamwork was the key . 

this film is set up as a cross between james bond and depalma's "" blow out , "" where the john travolta character was the victim of real and imagined conspiracies from all directions . 

it was travolta's vulnerability that made that film so exciting and claustrophobic . 

in this film , tom cruise is basically omniscient ( believe that ? ) and so there's no fun going on here whatsoever . 

the story is about as contrived as contrived gets , and is full of holes . 

there are basically two memorable sequences : one involves breaking into a kubrickesque computer room -- a task that could have been made much easier had the characters a whit of common sense ( suffice it to say that the alarm system is disengaged when the computer operator is in the room ) ; the second involves a high-speed train , a helicopter , and the chunnel and does not have to be seen to be disbelieved . 

the actors are all miscast , especially emannuelle beart as jim phelps wife , who cannot act , and ving rhames as a computer hacker ( ! ) , who looks lost and embarrased to be in this movie . 

tom cruise is no james bond , and jon voight looks more like bobby "" the brain "" heenan than jim phelps . 

brian depalma's career has been bafflingly erratic . 

at his best , he beats hitchcock at his own game ( "" blow out , "" "" carrie , "" "" body double "" ) but this is not his best . 

the screenplay was partly written by robert towne , who wrote the best scenario of the seventies in "" chinatown , "" but this script is perfunctory at best , and terrrible at worst . 

the cinematography has a comic book red/blue emphasis , which is nice to look at , but the suspense sequences are all telegraphed and this movie even features the old "" killer who talks too much before shooting thus giving the victim time to think of an escape "" trick . 

please don't spend your money on this ; it'll only encourage hollywood to make more .

"what are the warning signs of a * terrible * movie ? 

making it's debut at the dollar theater ? 

locally , chairman of the board did just that . 

having the annoying prop comic scott thompson ( better known as carrot top ) in the lead role ? 

chairman of the board , once again . 

how about an overly exhausted , paper thin plot approached with utter incompetence ? 

did somebody say chairman of the board ? 

that's right , carrot top's long dreaded major motion picture debut ( at least for a starring role ) is poking up in a handful of theaters across the country . 

chairman of the board stars the obnoxious , wannabe-zany king of redheaded standup comics as a lazy but creative , inventive but uneventful generation x- er named edison . 

living with a pair of surfer dudes in a small , rented house , edison bounces from job to job , always squandering away the money on his eccentric ( to say the least ) inventions and ignoring crucial responsibilities such as rent . 

this has the crabby landlady , ms . krubavitch ( estelle harris , best known as george constanza's mother on "" seinfeld "" ) , threatening an eviction if past due expenses aren't furnished post haste . 

as luck would have it , edison soon meets armand mcmillan ( jack warden ) , an old surfer dude who just so happens to be president of the multi-million dollar mcmillan industries . 

sharing a passion for more than just riding waves , armand is deeply impacted by the young inventor's notebook of dreams and ideas , and when the old man dies soon afterward , edison learns he is named a benefactor in armand's will . 

predictably , edison acquires the entire corporation and has to maintain productivity with absolutely no knowledge of the business world . 

predictably , there is a bitter nephew ( larry miller ) whose lesser inheritance fuels resentment that will lead to an elaborate sabotage plot . 

predictably , there is an attractive employee ( courtney thorne-smith ) whose initial repulsion will transform into love for our doofy protagonist . 

predictably , the man who knows nothing will fight against the odds and give the company it's most profitable and successful turnaround ever , all because he ran things by common sense and not greed . 

it's as though writers turi meyer , al septien , and alex zamm ( meyer and septien also wrote leprechaun 2 together ! ) 

pulled a plot out of a hat and worked carrot top into it . 

the jokes , the "" surprises "" , the developments - all of them run such a predictable path , it may only be carrot top's signature brazen red hairdo that sets this one apart from the myriad of similar films . 

a movie this bad speaks for itself . 

what's left to say when every element the movie possesses is a shameful retread of movies past ? 

the script is 100% recycled , the direction is hokey , and the acting is absolutely horrible . 

it is only thorne-smith who seems to take her job seriously , an accomplishment which surely deserves the medal of honor . 

she certainly went beyond the call of duty - she has to kiss carrot top ! ! ! ! ! ! 

 ( barf bag , please ! ) 

movies like this give the audience nothing to do but ponder just how many synonyms for "" bad "" there really are . 

chairman of the board , without a doubt , deserves each and every one . 

the only way this won't end up on everybody's "" bottom ten of the year "" list , is if they were lucky enough never to have seen it . 

just because you can't miss his outlandish fiery mane , don't skimp on avoiding this abhorrent feature .

"take two old and dying men , a lifetime of regrets , a house full of sins , a thoroughly despicable man , enough lies , insecurities and other character defects to keep a team of psychiatrists gainfully employed , then add a inexplicable meteorological and amphibian-based phenomenon and you will have summed up magnolia , the newest film from paul thomas anderson ( boogie nights ) . 

the movie tells multiple stories , weaving them together , or overlapping them during the course of its three hour running time . 

would that the stories were worth the telling . 

earl partridge ( jason robards , a thousand acres ) is dying of cancer . 

bedridden , in much pain , it is obvious that his time is growing short . 

his much younger wife played by julianne moore ( an ideal husband ) is surprised to find herself struggling with his impending death . 

having married for money , she discovers that she has actually fallen in love with the old guy and regrets having cheated and lied . 

earl regrets having cheated on his first wife and estranging himself from his only son ( tom cruise , eyes wide shut ) , now a misogynist self-help guru who teaches men how to "" seduce and destroy , "" his sexual and vulgar perspective on male/female relationships is so over-the-top as to be utterly unbelievable . 

meanwhile , jimmy gator ( philip baker hall , the insider ) is also dying of cancer . 

not as physically incapacitated as earl , jimmy is still able to perform his duties as the lovable host of a long-running quiz show which pits adults against children . 

the current whiz-quiz-kid is stanley spector ( jeremy blackman in his film debut ) who is tired of the pressure of performing and is willing to call it quits . 

on the other hand , quiz kid donnie smith ( william macy , mystery men ) would like nothing more than to return to the spotlight when he was a "" somebody . "" 

his pathetic life is souring as he can no longer capitalize on his brief 15 minutes of fame which stanley is all too eager to relinquish . 

jimmy has his own family crisis as his drug-addict daughter ( melora walters , boogie nights ) refuses to have anything to do with him for reasons which are not disclosed to us until the end of the film . 

grabbing at one last attempt at happiness she reaches out to a softhearted cop ( john c . reilly , never been kissed ) even as she tries to push herself away from him because she deems herself not worthy of his affection . 

this dysfunctional group carries on for what seems to be an interminable two-thirds of the movie . 

and then it gets worse , literally raining frogs . 

yes , frogs . 

assuming it to be an intended deus-ex-machina device , it is an ineffective one because it doesn't seem to faze the characters much . 

oh , they may step gingerly around the splattered frog corpses littering the streets , but otherwise , the frog shower didn't seem to change their behavior or pattern of living ( or dying ) . 

there is simply too much going on in this movie and most of it is distasteful to watch . 

mr . anderson further obscures the film by incorporating a loud and intrusive sound track that often drowned out the dialogue , a character who apparently rapped a significant clue to a plot development which was completely unintelligble , and a heavy handed segment of "" historical "" occurances containing ironic twists which set up absolutely nothing . 

one of the recurring themes is found in a line donnie quotes : "" we may be done with the past , but the past is not done with us . "" 

this is an absolute lie . 

god is in the forgiveness business . 

in fact , as we humbly ask for forgiveness and repent or change our offending mindset , god's word says that he not only forgives , he also forgets . 

 "" i , even i , am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake , and will not remember thy sins . "" 

isaiah 43 : 25 [kjv]

"the u . s . army utilizes a number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done . 

one particular field manual is known as the fm 22-5 , which among other things , covers the practice of saluting . 

under the "" saluting "" section is a sub-section which covers how a salute is rendered by a military work detail in the presence of a superior officer . 

the salute is rendered by the highest-ranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail , and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail . 

in any event , the salute is rendered only by the man ( or woman ) in charge , rather than by the whole group . 

almost at the very beginning of the general's daughter , we see a general's motorcade passing a work detail . 

everyone salutes . 

it looked impressive , but it just wasn't right . 

that little bit showed me that someone either didn't do the appropriate research , or made the conscious decision to go with style over substance for the scene . 

in fact , this would serve as a metaphor for the rest of the picture , as it seems director simon west tried so hard to craft a film with atmosphere and flash that he forgot a coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to a good movie . 

what results is a film that looks good , but like that one scene , just isn't right . 

the first fifteen minutes of the film is a good example . 

paul brenner ( john travolta ) is an agent for the army's criminal investigation division , undercover at a georgia army base to investigate an illegal arms sale . 

prior to the transaction , the buyer gets a whiff that brenner isn't the unscrupulous supply sergeant he's supposed to be , and later that night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat on which brenner is living . 

so ensues a cat and mouse action sequence which ends like a certain scene in raiders of the lost ark ( we'll just say that it involves propellers ) . 

brenner then receives new orders when the commanding general's daughter , captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , is found naked , bound , and dead on one of the base's training ranges . 

he is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder . 

what i want to know is why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary . 

it gives no insight into brenner , other than the fact that he's a little cocky . 

does the arms subplot turn up later ? 

no , so why add this extra running time to the film ? 

the answer : it looked cool . 

or how about the "" atmosphere "" ? 

the beginning of the general's daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south - thick trees , dirt roads , sultry colors over water - all backed up with bayouesque music . 

nice immersion in the setting , but it soon doesn't matter , for when the film's plot shifts over to the murder investigation , so does the entire mood . 

no attention is paid to the location of the story , and the music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme . 

did the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie ? 

instead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film , we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another , just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside . 

the above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie . 

as i've already mentioned , an entire section of the film doesn't jibe with the rest , and the characterization only adds to the difficulty . 

brenner , who comes across as a man with little respect for authority , suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell ( james cromwell ) and utters some of the corniest "" yes , sir "" s i've ever heard . 

he even delivers an emotion-charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general's daughter , even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous . 

sunhill , who initially comes across as a professional investigator , utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information , and even revels in her ingenuity . 

both characters are protagonists , but it's hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place , and in some cases , simply unappealing . 

i could imagine that during filming , west would shoot a scene , then take the actors aside and tell them , "" let's do it again , but this time , i want more . "" 

i say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good , in this film they overact in most of their scenes . 

an even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the general's aide , colonel fowler . 

i swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention . 

a far cry from his days as linc in "" the mod squad "" , i can't help but think he was acting from west's direction . 

a couple of side characters including a west point psychologist ( john beasly ) and a young female private ( ariyan a . johnson ) make their scenes nearly impossible to bear . 

the only two actors who seem to have escaped west's influence are james woods , who provides a good performance as colonel moore , elisabeth's mentor at the psychological operations unit , and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police . 

woods relishes the role of a man whose job is playing with people's minds , and does so without ever taking it over the top . 

hutton just kind of hangs around , but at least he wasn't overacting . 

i haven't read the nelson demille novel on which this movie was based , but i'll bet more than a few dollars that the story was better in book form . 

the movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space , or provide bits of information which seem to neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished . 

every time we're presented with some new aspect to the case , west gives us more of that flash by playing it up like it's the most momentous discovery ever , but the information is not used by the investigators at all . 

instead , when conclusions are drawn , they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts , but lucky guesses instead . 

the army should have saved time by bringing in brennan and sunhill , letting them play a game of twenty questions with the suspects , then letting them guess who the killer was . 

would've been over in a half hour . 

the film finishes with a sort of bookend , featuring the same style and southern scenery as the very beginning . 

literally during the closing credits , we get to see brennan get in his car and drive off , then we get to see sunhill get in her car and drive off . 

they both seem kind of happy . 

maybe they were driving away from simon west . 
"
"it stands as a moment one will not soon forget : a giant , green ogre flips through the pages of a cliche fairy tale , narrating it with every bit of dull inspiration that the story holds . 

this leads one to believe that this serves as the prologue to shrek , dreamworks' second computer animated feature , but in a pricelessly hilarious bit of cinema , a page of this tale serves as that ogre's toilet paper . 

from this opening moment , one can infer shrek's defying of all expectations regarding it as a standard , disney-esque fairy tale . 

although rampant moments of hilarity dot shrek , the true charm of the film lies in the bold elements of friendship , courage , and acceptance , excelled by outstanding direction , stunning actor voice work , and most importantly , a witty screenplay with more going on than meets the eye . 

while shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward adults , positive friendship values aimed at younger children fulfill the storyline : shrek , the previously mentioned ogre , holds a position of absolute nothingness within his community . 

the jolly green giant meets a fellow outsider , known only as the donkey ( his species ) who talks , and although he remains reluctant to warm up to him for a good portion of time , shrek eventually comes to a mutual understanding with him by acknowledging their common state as outcasts of the world . 

the pair team up to retrieve princess fiona from a castle guarded by a dragon for the powerful lord farquaad , learning quite a bit about each other and themselves along the way . 

their friendship exhibits the core theme of the need for someone to lean on , exemplifying to any child who may witness the film that acting as an honest companion can unquestionably affect someone . 

shrek and donkey endure as supposed freaks of nature due only to their differences from others but cling to each other for support and guidance along their journey . 

courage demonstrates itself within two major storylines : along the journey to rescue fiona , donkey's immeasurable cowardice reveals itself . 

whether he encounters walking over a shaky bridge or living alone , donkey withholds fears that he continuously puts aside without self-acknowledgment . 

but the yapping donkey must face his phobias when presented with the giant , fire-breathing dragon guarding fiona ; either he dies from terror or he triumphs with courage . 

he wisely chooses courage by pretending as if no dangerous situation actually faces him , allowing the donkey to overcome a horror that likely only continued due to his insistence of them . 

secondly , upon shrek's and donkey's redeeming of princess fiona , the ogre finds the princess has plans for whomever saves her : to satisfy her desire for a ( human ) knight in shining armor . 

throughout this storyline , shrek faces his deep , perpetual misgivings of inhering as an ogre and struggles to determine how he will reveal his true identity to fiona . 

an ongoing struggle occurs between himself and his reluctance of the truth , but eventually , shrek courageously conquers his fear by telling the forbidden secret to fiona . 

children can realize from donkey and shrek that fear remains only as complicated as one makes it ; if one sets his/her mind to overcoming something in particular , endless possibilities exist . 

after the friendships and courage prevail , the three central characters at the heart of shrek must take one more stretch of development : acceptance . 

surprisingly , fiona holds a dark secret of her own : due to a spell cast upon her years ago , she transforms into an ogre by night . 

in this storyline , fiona must learn to hold acceptance for herself , and she must realize what beauty truly means : to simply act as one's self . 

upon fiona's learning of shrek's desire to pursue a relationship with her , fiona , knowing that acceptance of herself serves as the only platform for her love with shrek to work , gives in to her inner demons of self-ridicule and hatred . 

any child can pull from fiona's transformation the meaning of beauty and the meaning of self-acceptance . 

on the technical side , shrek triumphs . 

directors adam adamson and vicky jenson pace shrek in a consistent and satisfying manner , evenly distributing the lessons learned by the central characters . 

these central characters spring to life thanks to brilliant voice work from mike myers ( shrek ) , eddie murphy ( donkey ) , and cameron diaz ( princess fiona ) . 

myers creates his shrek as a lovable and troubled ogre whose green color not only serves as a skin color but perhaps his envy of other , "" normal "" beings . 

murphy succeeds with his donkey through recreating the high-strung persona that so many know the actor to have off screen . 

cameron diaz exudes charisma and innocence as fiona , giving the princess/ogre a sense of power that many female characters in animated films lack . 

while the direction and voice work certainly elevate shrek , the ultimate factor in the film succeeding lies in the screenplay , written by ted elliott , terry rossio , joe stillman , and roger s . h . 

schulman . 

the script never underestimates the intelligence of the viewer , combining the three previously spoken of elements with humor for adults and children alike . 

capping it off with a constant tongue-in-cheek feel that pokes fun at classic disney animated features , the fresh and entertaining screenplay delivers . 

with shrek , dreamworks executive jeffrey katzenberg has certainly one-upped himself by creating an instant animated classic that will live on for ages to come . 

the smaller children will laugh and cheer ; the adults will laugh even harder and leave understanding much that their children did not . 

a film that breaks stereotypes and creates a definite standard of its own , shrek can certainly endure as one for the ages . 
"
"martin scorsese's films used to intimidate me . 

because of his reputation , i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks . 

as much as i enjoyed them , i usually felt like i missed something . 

i learned from scorsese's casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story . 

no mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies . 

for example , in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other . 

there was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on . 

or toward the end , when he uses three quick dissolves to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building . 

again , the simple , mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing . 

i don't mean to say that his techniques are not creative or good-looking . 

but he simply uses the best tool for the job . 

it shouldn't have surprised me , then , that kundun , a film about a mystical religion , actually turned out to be quite straightforward . 

the movie follows the life of the 14th dalai lama , the spiritual and political leader of tibet . 

the movie's title is another name for the dalai lama which means "" ocean of wisdom . "" 

his story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story . 

 ( one of which makes an interesting statement : pay attention to the film's opening shot and watch where it is repeated . ) 

we first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old . 

his curiosity and self-assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama . 

a test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before . 

several items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items . 

the child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own . 

the boy picks correctly , proving that he is the new , and the old , dalai lama . 

scorsese and long-time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk . 

before selecting an item , he would look at the monk , perhaps for some sort of confirmation . 

sometimes he picked right the first time , and sometimes he made a second choice . 

either way , whether through reincarnation or quick human perception , the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise , perceptive leader . 

>from this point on , the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lama's spirit and the future leader of a nation . 

it is a great weight to put on the mind of a child . 

in the u . s . it might be grounds for a call to social services . 

but the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage . 

neither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable , well-rounded person . 

certain patterns take shape over the years . 

for example , the dalai lama is fascinated by technology . 

radios , clocks , and telescopes are some of his favorite toys . 

when he is old enough to accept his leadership , he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet . 

he also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain , including herd animals . 

it's nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter . 

but the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibet's gigantic neighbor , china . 

tibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china , as , first the propaganda , then the political pressure , and finally the armies , come across their common border . 

the chinese invasion is so successful that the lama's life is in danger if he stays . 

the movie ends when , after much agonizing , the dalai lama leaves tibet for india . 

the story doesn't lead up to a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do . 

it just doesn't fit that mold . 

if it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie ( perhaps more like seven years in tibet , which is good in its own right ) . 

the pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that . 

the structure of the film is made to fit the characters and events , not vice-versa . 

perhaps because the pace is slower , we have more time to notice the beautiful art , vestments , and architecture of tibet . 

a mandala , ( tibetan sand painting ) with beautiful , vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie . 

the robes and hats of state are bright red and gold . 

the bricks are a rich reddish brown , not unlike the skin tone of the tibetans . 

even the touchstone pictures logo before the movie ( which is usually light blue ) is the red and gold of tibet . 

philip glass composed the music for kundun , and he was the perfect choice . 

for those who don't know of glass , his music is like a tibetan mandala . 

his building blocks are lots of small notes , tiny grains of music , which are first grouped , then repeated in patterns . 

these patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of a larger composition . 

people won't be flocking to kundun for it's great ending , or talking about its outstanding plot , but it does have a lot to offer : an interesting lifetime , exotic sights , rich cinematography , and innovative music . 

it gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes a warm look at the dalai lama as a person . 

on top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese , who gives the film a strong , beautiful , consistent look . 
"
" ( dimension films , "" scream 2 "" 's distributor , has asked press to say extremely little -- if anything -- about the film's twisty plot . 

that's no easy task considering the wit that deserves to be mentioned here , but i will do my best to be vague ( now , there's a first ) . ) 

 "" the first one was [good] , but all the rest sucked , "" said a cinematically-savvy teen in last winter's wes craven thriller "" scream , "" her statement referring to the films of the "" nightmare on elm street "" series but really putting down franchise overkill in general . 

the comment certainly carries clout : for every truly great sequel , there appears to be a couple of duds , making one wonder if writers are better off sticking solely with fresh ideas . 

but like it or not , along comes "" scream 2 . "" and believe it or not , it's a doozy -- a slick , sinister , madly subversive good time at the movies , as intent on sending up hollywood's sequel syndrome as much as its prequel poked fun at slasher conventions . 

 "" scream 2 "" is definitely that rare movie thing -- a follow-up that can stand along side its original with pride . 

it's been two years since a pair of overzealous horror movie fans clad in edvard munch-esque get-ups carved their way through the young populace of woodsboro , california . 

those surviving the ordeal have gotten on with their lives . 

plucky heroine sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) is a drama student at the midwestern windsor college ; her pop culture-whiz pal randy meeks ( jamie kennedy ) has tagged along . 

trash tabloid reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) has written a best-seller based on their ordeal , the basis of which has been turned into a ( very bad ) movie called "" stab . "" 

and dewey riley ( david arquette ) , still suffering from wounds inflicted during "" scream , "" has left his job as a police officer for a while . 

life is tranquil . . . 

at least for a while . 

several sudden murders bring sidney , randy , gale and dewey together again , but with suspicious eyes cast on each other and most of those in their surroundings -- if these four people learned anything from the past , it's to trust no one . 

thus , the possible victim/potential killer list includes said quartet , as well as : derek ( jerry o'connell ) , sidney's new beau ; cici ( sara michelle gellar ) , a chatty sorority gal ; joel ( duane martin ) , gale's cameraman who's not too thrilled with her blood-soaked past ; hallie ( elise neal ) , sidney's sassy roommate ; debbie ( laurie metcalf ) , a local reporter who gives gale some not-too-friendly competition ; and mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , randy's good friend and fellow film student . 

cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , the man sidney wrongly accused of her mother's murder in scream , also shows up on campus -- but why ? 

like the first scream , craven and screenwriter kevin williamson inaugurate things with a bang . 

this time , it's an extended sequence that finds an african-american couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a sneak preview of "" stab , "" making sly references about everything from sandra bullock to the lunchmeat non-roles of blacks in slasher cinema . 

before tragedy ensues at the screening , the movie-within-a-movie setup allows for plenty of jokey moments , including a scene from "" stab "" which turns scream's now-famous drew barrymore prologue on its ear . 

 ( "" b---- , hang up the phone and star-69 his a-- ! "" 

pinkett yells at the screen . ) 

it's funny , creepy stuff ( i don't think i'll ever feel safe in a movie theater again ) that effectively foreshadows the ratio of smart scares and spoofy laughs down the road . 

another flawless example of this is a riotous cell phone-assault of the killer on randy , dewey and gale in broad daylight ; it builds comedically and ends with genuine terror because of the emotional investment made on these delicious characters . 

there are other superb set pieces , but explaining them risks ruining their effect . 

there are more players this time around as to provide both a higher number suspects and a staggering body count . 

it's something of a trade-in -- the new characters are too large in number to be as fully-developed as the original "" scream "" gang , but this movie packs in knowing performances ( especially by kennedy and cox ) and more death for your dollar . 

it can be argued that , while the original might outclass it by a tad , scream 2 is both scarier and funnier . 

it certainly doesn't skimp with shocks -- a major one being the killing of one cast member very near and dear to my heart ( i actually questioned craven and williamson's judgment here , considering how much this person has added to these films ) . 

sometimes you wish that more could have been done with stab -- the two scenes we're shown are dead-on -- but for film fans , there are plenty of subtle nods to movies like "" the usual suspects , "" "" aliens "" and "" the empire strikes back . "" 

still , "" scream 2 "" does so many things right , it's petty to quibble . 

its penchant for parody is irresistible , discussions of the merits of film sequels and all . 

the attractive , solid cast is a definite bonus . 

and the denouement ( while not as shocking as "" scream "" 's ) is priceless ; the film's final revelation incorporates bits of a particular horror film prominently referred to in "" scream "" with one of the best bad guy motives ever put on paper . 

all this and a "" scream 3 "" is in the works . 

knowing the series' tendency for self-reference , perhaps one of its characters will again discuss the concept of sequel justice . 

mentioning "" scream 2 "" 'll help them in their argument .

"what makes reindeer games even more disappointing than just a predictable , lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project . 

most of the people involved in reindeer games just came off terrible slumps with excellent comeback performances in their most recent films . 

john frankenheimer , who made the unforgettable cold war drama the manchurian candidate way back in the early 60's , recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some magic left in his directorial skills when he created the brilliant car chase scenes in ronin . 

screenwriter ehren kruger gave a remarkable first impression when he wrote the script for the underrated arlington rd . 

ben affleck displayed his comedic talents in dogma and boiler room , and even on saturday night live directly after the horrible forces of nature and 200 cigarettes . 

even charlize theron , who i was convinced couldn't act , did a decent job in cider house rules . 

when all of these bright stars come together , one would assume that the movie will have great potential to be entertaining . 

after coming out of the theater showing reindeer games , disbelief was my first reaction ? then frustration . 

the movie could have premiered on cinemax at two in the morning starring an all-rookie cast and still would have been equally lacking in entertaining . 

the acting is so pitiful and the script so dull , i may have to rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are . 

it seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given a fair amount of improvisational rights . 

we have all seen ben affleck have some fun on the set , it is so apparent in a number of scenes in good will hunting when he exchanges jokes with his friends at a bar . 

the actors in that movie were having fun and , from that , the audience had fun . 

reindeer games is the complete opposite ; the actors don't seem to want to be their characters ( even danny trejo , who will do practically anything , doesn't look like he is enjoying himself ) , causing the audience to quickly lose interest . 

evidence of public disapproval was noted when a woman behind me yelled "" boy this movie is horrible ! "" 

and when there were scattered giggles during the most dramatic moments . 

the story follows a man , rudy ( ben affleck ) , who is leaving prison in a few days along with his best friend and cellmate nick ( james frain ) . 

nick has been exchanging love letters with a beautiful woman , ashley ( charlize theron ) , and cannot wait to leave prison and meet her in person . 

when nick is killed in a prison riot , rudy decides to pretend to be nick and take ashley out on a date for the christmas holidays . 

unfortunately ashley's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) interferes with their relationship . 

thinking rudy is nick , he kidnaps rudy and threatens to kill him unless he helps rob a casino , which nick use to work at as a security guard . 

now rudy must pretend to be nick so he can protect ashley from her brother gabriel . 

confused ? 

the movie only gets more complex as it goes on , until it gets way , way too complex at its climax . 

but reindeer games makes its first serious mistake during the first half an hour . 

the hero commits a greedy , selfish act when he decides to pretend he is his dead cellmate in order to date ashley . 

some hero . 

the point of a hero is to do the morally correct thing , a person for the audience to relate to or admire . 

when rudy lies and cheats his way into trouble , instead of gathering support from me for him to ultimately succeed in getting the bad guys , i felt more like he was getting what he deserved and even wanted to see him fail at times . 

the most irritating part of the film ( besides the fact that this is a christmas movie released in february ) is the number of chances the bad guys get to kill rudy but fail or delay for some idiotic reason . 

the routine in which the bad guy must explain his genius plan to the hero before attempting to kill him with some elaborate machine is getting so tired nowadays , especially when i eagerly want to see the hero dead . 

the only saving grace keeping this movie from receiving zero stars is an amusing but pointless cameo from isaac hayes as a prisoner upset with his food . 

why he was in this movie for such a pointless role beats me . 

why any of these people had anything at all to do with this movie beats me .

"8mm is not going to enlighten your day . 

it's a dark , grimy and disturbing portrait of underworld snuff films and filled with excessive violence . 

not only do you need the stomach to make it through this bloated mess , you'll require a lot of patience as well . 

nicolas cage seems to be doing quite a bit of overacting as of late . 

he wore a bizarre get-up and did a lot of yelling in the terminally awful snake eyes , and here he attempts a performance that can relate to someone completely losing their grip on reality . 

cage plays private investigator tom welles , praised for his secrecy and reliability . 

at home , welles is a family man , with a wife ( catherine keener ) and a small daughter to take care of . 

his new assignment is a bizarre one : the wife of a formally deceased millionaire has hired him to solve a mystery regarding a film found in her husband's safe . 

the film appears to be some kind of cheap pornography involving a teenage girl and a masked man , until the girl is brutally murdered . 

or so it seems . 

welles , of course , begins to burrow deeper and deeper to uncover the truth . 

and the more he becomes involved in this disturbing case , the more he gets in over his head . 

he hires an adult book store clerk named max california ( joaquin phoenix ) to be his guide through the ugly underworld of pornography . 

max knows what welles is getting himself into , and explains , `you dance with the devil , the devil don't change . 

the devil changes you . ' 

these turn out to be very wise words . 

8mm has a premise that begs for a better execution . 

the set-up is slick and well played , as cage uncovers the identity of the girl and travels to hollywood to locate her . 

this is where everything goes awry . 

although director joel schumacher succeeds in frightening us with his grotesque portrait of the `real world' , he forgot to inject any interest or excitement to the formula . 

everything about the movie becomes dull and lifeless , repelling the viewer like the effect of bug spray to insects . 

although it had enormous potential , the third act of 8mm is a total bust , leaving intrigued audiences in a baffling state of extreme disappointment as the proceedings spiral out of control . 

cage is the film's sole flame of energy . 

his performance is actually believable , but soon the director's demands start to weigh heavily on his shoulder and he begins stumbling along in desperation . 

still , you've got to give him credit for holding this project together as long as he did , for that is no easy feat when you consider the problems at hand . 

welles' trail soon leads him to a bizarre filmmaker ( played convincingly by peter stormare ) who is notorious for the hardest-hitting snuff films in the industry . 

this is where cage goes over the edge into a serial killer-like phase , in which he must take revenge on all those who murdered the innocent girl in the film . 

he tracks down the masked man responsible for the killing ( chris bauer ) , and they have a bloody brawl in the local cemetery , a fight sequence that would look more at home in a schwarzenegger movie . 

written by andrew kevin walker , 8mm dissipates into a poor man's seven , with all the violence but little of the effectiveness that made the latter such a chilling masterpiece . 

furthermore , what has become of joel schumacher ? 

the director has recently experienced a major drought , slumming in the depths of dismal flop after flop ( batman and robin , anyone ? ) . 

this putrid thriller is certainly not going to revive his career , so perhaps schumacher should start exploring his lighter side .

"when i first heard of contact , the hype was building it up as a sci-fi blockbuster . 

now , with that in mind , coupled with the knowledge of jodie foster's involvement in the project , i thought "" what in the world is foster doing in a sci-fi blockbuster ? ? ? "" . 

as it turned out , my expectations were completely nullified and turned topsy-turvy . 

robert zemeckis , back from the euphoria created by his last film , forrest gump , once again proves his mastery in fusing tales of adventure with along the endearing lines of human spirit . 

don't get me wrong , contact is sci-fi ? but with a definite difference . 

based on the late carl sagan novel of the same name , the story delves itself in questions on science and god ; fact and faith . 

allie ( foster ) is a radio astronomer . 

she spends her time listening to the stars , via ultra-huge communication dishes in search of intelligent life beyond the solar system . 

her passion for `long-distance communication' is the result of her younger days being spent avidly in front of a ham-radio system ( a hobbyist radio communication device ) which her late-father bought for her . 

a scene which particularly strengthens the audiences' view of the passion is when she asked her father whether she could contact her late-mother through the ham-radio system in which her father replied "" not even the most powerful radio in the world can do that , now "" . 

allie's research is based on the seti project ( search for extra terrestrial intelligence ) , in which she listens to radio emissions from other galaxies in the hope of finding one which would suggest intelligent manipulation . 

her work has never been off the scrutiny of the us government , which considers it a waste of taxpayer's money and politically unviable , her supervisor ( tom skerritt ) pulls the plug on seti . 

undaunted , allie managed to gather a loyal group of `believers' and eventually found funding from a large private corporation . 

the following months were treacherous to their hopes and research as they are contantly pressured by the government but all that changed when one day , she caught an emission of a seemingly intelligent repeating sound-wave . 

the news of her find attracted hordes of alien believers , cultist , the media and of course , the government . 

the situation became intense upon her discovery of pictorial plans on building a form of transport which were embedded within the repeating sound emission . 

as the world join forces to build this transport , allie is desperate to be the one to go . 

she enrols herself among a few hopefuls , to represent the world when the transport is ready for operation . 

her eligibility for the spot failed when she is questioned on her beliefs in the existence of god by the president's spiritual advisor ( mcconaughey ) ; allie , being an atheist , a result of her belief in fact and science , refuses to budge upon questioning . 

at this point the movie plot thickens considerably as she is romantically involved with the president's spiritual advisor . 

a strong point which propelled the movie is the depth of its main characters played by foster and mcconaughey . 

from the very first meeting scene , it is obvious that the two of them was sort of kindred spirits but they were worlds apart in almost all aspects , foster being a person drawn to science and facts and mcconaughey being one who believes in faith , hope and the power of the unseen . 

the meeting of their worlds , added with the situation which they are put into makes the entire storytelling process near flawless . 

many people who read the synopsis of this film would find it a tad too ridiculous , but by actually immersing yourself in it , gives you an entirely different perspective ; one which is free from bias and pre-conceptions . 

zemeckis and his team of screen writers have done a remarkable job in telling this tale through film . 

contact works by not delving in controversy but rather , touches the thinking audience , urging them to ponder upon the questions raised in the film concerning fact and faith ; whether one can actually find compromise within . 

i consider contact as one of the must-sees for this year . 
"
"i'm not sure i should be writing a review of the witches of eastwick , because i'm not sure just what the hell ( pardon the expression ) was going on in it . 

however , i can express the most important observation i made of it , i . e . 

i didn't like it . 

if i had to summarize this film , i think i'd conclude it was an updating of one of those old new england folk tales of someone selling their souls to old scratch and how they try to get out of the deal . 

that's the kernel of it , anyway . 

tossed into this are little bits and pieces that occasionally seem to be saying something about men and women , feminism , the role of the devil , modern reformers , and friendship . 

unfortunately , little or no effort is ever made to follow up and elucidate on these concepts ; they're simply thrown out and then left to rot while the film goes on apace . 

actually , i think that most of the audience was even more confused than i was . 

they came in expecting some kind of supernatural comedy , on the level of ghostbusters , and were a bit confused to be getting a folk tale with philosophical overtones . 

they laughed , or tried to laugh , at moments that were either barely funny , or much more horrible than funny , as if that could bend the film away from it's rather frightening direction . 

three women ( cher , susan sarandon , and michelle pfieffer ) live in eastwick , a small midwestern town . 

one night , while drinking late into the evening , they begin wishing for the ideal man to drop into their lives . 

in seeming answer to their idle daydreams , a wealthy eccentric moves into a mansion on the hill and seduces each one by attempting to be everything they want him to be . 

he soon shows evidence of mystical--perhaps demonic--power , and his devotion to the women's merest fantasies or wishes has dangerous overtones . 

even worse , when ignored his moods become ugly , and he mistreats the women for spurning him . 

anyway , the problems : all three female characters are fairly uninteresting , and several are cardboard stereotypes , especially sarandon's character . 

we never get inside them , never feel sympathetic to them , because their dialogue and personalities seem pretty bland . 

as for nicholson , well , even the devil needs a direction to go in , and while darryl van horne is the most interesting character in the movie ( due to the grace of the screenwriter and , more importantly , nicholson's acting ) , he still can't be yanked in one direction and then another without making him a little vague . 

and then there's the special effects . 

not in themselves--they weren't that good--but their overuse . 

i was almost positive , until i saw the credits , that the witches of eastwick was either produced by alexander salkind ( who has turned out the slop named superman ii and iii and supergirl ) , because of the big name actors in dopy stunts , or stephen spielberg , after the 18th vomit scene and the nicholson-blown-down-the-street stunt . 

nope , it's another bunch of guys , and directed by george miller , who has shown great skill with stunts/special effects before ( the road warrior , "" nightmare at 20 , 00 feet "" episode of twilight zone : the movie ) but apparently doesn't know when to turn off the wind machine and let his people act . 

f'gawds sake , guys , this is jack nicholson ! 

let him loose ! 

let him grin demonically ! 

skip the splitting earth and fake lightning ! 

watching the scene where nicholson is tossed out of the car by the voodoo doll , all i could think of was , "" what a waste "" . 

if you're going to use slapstick like that , use it up on pee wee herman . 

nicholson does what he can with the role , and when he can find his bearings , can be extremely good ( the scene in the church , for instance ) , but most of the time , he seems a bit stiff , as if he's not sure what he should be doing next . 

and no wonder . 

this script goes all over the map , giving you the feeling that it'd just love to be allegory , but it's not sure about what-- maybe if you give it time it'll think of something . 

so what is the witches of eastwick ? 

a horror movie ? 

a folk tale ? 

a comedy ? 

a statement about women ? 

an examination of the religious right or comparitive morality ? 

i tend to think of the image that seems to dominate the movie for me . . . watching 

someone regurgitate half-digested bits of food and cherry pits all over rooms , people , the screen , and ultimately , the audience . 

in other words , a mess . 

 ( $2 . 00 ) 

if you like nicholson enough to watch him here ; maybe 25% of his charm is able to make it through the logjams of others . 
"
"did claus von bulow try to kill his wife sunny in their newport mansion ? 

that is the question reversal of fortune asks you to consider as it opens in a hospital ward , with a comatose sunny von bulow . 

she is the main narrator of the film , in a narrative trick that was extraordinarily risky for schroeder . 

the dramatic trick works , as sunny von bulow narrates a compelling story of murder , sex , unhappiness , and a lawyer's moral dilemma as he takes a case he thinks he cannot win . 

jeremy irons is claus von bulow , in what is his finest role , and one of the most devastingly evil performances in history . 

he is as hated as any man alive , as cold as a cucumber . 

his remorse for his wife's comatose condition is nonexistant , and it is no wonder that even his children have difficulty accepting his version of what happened during christmas , 1980 . 

the background to the case is such . 

during christmas of 1979 , sunny von bulow fell into a deep coma from which she recovered and awoke . 

the same situation occured in 1980 , only sunny never woke , and probably never will . 

when examined , it was found that she had 14 times the normal amount of insulin within her blood . 

claus von bulow is then accused of attempted murder by his stepson , convicted , and freed on bail . 

he immediately hires alan dershowitz , the renowed harvard law professor , to acquit him . 

ron silver is magnificent as a moral lawyer who cannot stand what has happened to him . 

we follow him through two very different cases ; the case of the johnson case , where two innocent kids are standing on death row for a crime they didn't commit , and von bulow , who he still hasn't figured out . 

dershowitz doesn't know what happened to sunny , and he is extremely hesitant to take the case . 

nevertheless , he does , based on certain things which happen during the investigative process that deeply upset him . 

together with a group of law students , dershowitz concocts a defense and ultimately get the verdict reversed . 

silver's performance is one of a handful of solid roles in this deep film . 

schroeder directs on many different levels , with multiple plot lines which blend in wonderfully in the mind of alan dershowitz . 

there are flaws ; at times , the film gets overly theatrical . 

yet , due to glenn close's troubled and brutally honest performance as sunny von bulow , the use of her comatose body as a narrator works here fairly well . 

the flashbacks are good , but at times schroeder doesn't fill in the blanks . 

the movie could have benefited with the increased attention of certain developments during the film , and it could have used a better ending . 

the film progressed wonderfully before ending suddenly , without any intelligent conclusion . 

the supporting characters are often neglected , and dershowitz's team should have been allowed to grow character wise , but schroeder over-simplifies the story and the characters . 

yet , for all these flaws , the film is deeply engrossing because of irons . 

as von bulow , he is brutally evil . 

anti-semitic , prejudiced , arrogant , protective , he is a rotten , lying monster , whose conviction may have been wrong legally , but morally he was to blame . 

irons plays him to a cold perfection , with pathetic attempts to gain moral support for his claims to innocence . 

he is an adulterous liar and a cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder . 

however , the genius of reversal of fortune comes in its distinction between moral culpability and legal responsibility . 

there is no doubt von bulow is responsible for his wife's death by years of neglect and coldness . 

however , legally , did he do the murder ? 

schroeder dares the viewer to make up his own mind . 

with all the character flaws , reversal of fortune is an engrossing puzzle because it is intelligent ; he wants the viewer to make up his own mind . 

schroeder taunts the viewer with contradictory revelations , and then mentions that the answer to this compelling puzzle shall be revealed when we join sunny von bulow , in death . 

for all the failed dramatic theatrics , this is one that works beautifully . 

we don't know what happened . 

that sense of legal ambiguousness , along with von bulow's obvious moral guilt , is why reversalf fortune works . 

in the end , von bulow is as sadistic as ever . 

irons is haunting , and that is why reversal of fortune is so good .

"capsule : five friends at a stag party are involved in the accidental killing of a prostitute . 

the cover-up attempt becomes a monster that eats up the friends , two wives and several innocent bystanders . 

this was a real audience pleaser at toronto , but it did not do much for me . 

 , low 0 ( -4 to +4 ) 

- directed by peter berg who acted in the last seduction and copland . 

- five buddies go on a stag outing to las vegas while cameron diaz works through the logistics of her upcoming wedding to one of them . 

one of the buddies accidentally kills a prostitute . 

- several people with no moral compass . 

they started out with a simple , innocent little cocaine party ( ! ) and by accident look what happened . 

they have one moral person among them ( daniel stern ) , and one totally amoral person ( christian slater ) . 

it is more selfish to let the amoral lead , so they do . 

- this film is strange , but not really funny or biting . 

black comedy should actually be funny as well as strange . 

there should be some element of satire . 

the satire is missing here . 

i did not find myself laughing here either . 

what we have is a strange crime tale . 

- one just does not care what happens to these people . 

- the same idea of people just getting themselves in deeper and deeper has been done frequently . 

if this film is popular it is just bringing a familiar plot to a new generation . 

- it begins like diner ( particularly with daniel stern ) and ends up like an extended horror/crime comic book . 

- there are several logical holes in script . 

if a security man goes to investigate a complaint and disappears , wouldn't the guests he was investigating be the first suspects ? 

someone framed for a crime in the way shown would be judged innocent after minimal forensic detective work . 

 ( i am desperately trying to avoid making this a spoiler . ) 

- popular and situation ethics get a real slamming . 

- some acting of grief is hammy and overdone . 

more yelling than humor .

"it's hard not to recommend "" the others . "" 

the supernatural thriller , written and directed by alejandro amen ? bar ( "" open your eyes "" ) , adroitly establishes and maintains a low-key atmosphere of menace . 

the cinematography , by javier aguirresarobe , is as good as i have ever seen and nicole kidman gives another in her growing body of fine performances . 

but the pacing of the story moves from deliberate to downright sluggish and the payoff of the tale left me less than satisfied . 

overall , the film plays like a very high quality version of any number of old "" twilight zone "" episodes where the characters spend a great deal of time wandering about looking afraid and disoriented , only to learn they are actually a child's toy , a military test subject or a department store dummy . 

watching those vintage shows and listening to the players chatter , i always wanted to shout , "" get on with it ! "" 

as much as i appreciated the atmosphere and acting in "" the others , "" my reaction was much the same . 

set at an island mansion off the coast of england during world war ii , the story focuses on grace ( kidman ) , who tends to her children anne ( alakina mann ) and nicholas ( james bentley ) and worries about her husband , charles ( christopher eccleston ) , a missing serviceman . 

anne and nicholas suffer from photosensitivity and grace patrols the estate with the keys to all 50 doors , protecting the little ones from excess light by making sure that only one door is open at a time . 

at the beginning of the film , three servants , mrs . mills ( fionnula flanagan ) , young , mute lydia ( elaine cassidy ) , and mr . tuttle ( eric sykes ) , an aging gardener , join the family . 

the two that speak seem agreeable enough at first , but it soon becomes apparent that they know something that grace does not . 

to make matters worse , the children are upset : nicholas is unusually jittery and anne claims to be seeing ghosts . 

grace attempts to blame the troubles on the new arrivals to her home , only to realize that whatever is happening is beyond them . 

that's essentially the whole story , with the tension growing until the pivotal moment when everything becomes clear . 

earlier , there is an outstanding scene where grace darts outside , only to be enveloped in fold after fold of shimmering fog . 

the visuals in the otherworldly sequence , courtesy of aguirresarobe , are simply astounding . 

i also enjoyed the presence of religion , a rarity in films dealing with the supernatural . 

grace is a christian and answers her children's questions about life and death with the assurance of a devout worshiper . 

when mother is away , though , the kids speculate whether her statements are fact or folklore , just as real children do . 

but those nice touches fail to enliven a film that is too slow or make up for a lackluster ending . 

 "" the others "" sets out to be a classic ghost story , but fails to grasp that special something that makes such films more than layers of mist .

"two party guys bob their heads to haddaway's dance hit "" what is love ? "" 

while getting themselves into trouble in nightclub after nightclub . 

it's barely enough to sustain a three-minute _saturday_night_live_ skit , but _snl_ producer lorne michaels , _clueless_ creator amy heckerling , and paramount pictures saw something in the late night television institution's recurring "" roxbury guys "" sketch that would presumably make a good feature . 

emphasis on the word "" presumably . "" 

_a_night_at_the_roxbury_ takes an already-thin concept and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking point--and that of viewers' patience levels . 

the first five minutes or so of _roxbury_ play very much like one of the original "" roxbury guys "" skits . 

with "" what is love ? "" 

blaring on the soundtrack , the brotherly duo of doug and steve butabi ( chris kattan and will ferrell ) bob their heads , scope out "" hotties "" at clubs , and then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrusts . 

there is one crucial difference , however--these guys speak . 

that little fact has been used as justification for the film's existence , that the butabis' newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors for the characters . 

the doors opened by director john fortenberry and screenwriters steve koren , ferrell , and kattan are new , that's for sure , but they all lead to comic dead ends . 

there is no story per se , only a loosely structured and linked series of subplots . 

the brothers literally run into ( or , rather , get run into , as in by car ) richard grieco of _21_jump_street_ fame , and through him they gain entrance into the exclusive roxbury club . 

there , they meet a hotshot club owner ( chazz palminteri , conspicuously uncredited--can you blame him ? ) , who takes an interest in an idea of theirs . 

meanwhile , the bros' overbearing father ( dan hedaya ) wants them to stop clubbing . 

when doug refuses and the dimwitted steve obeys his father , a rift is created between the two . 

the narrative messiness of _roxbury_ would have been forgivable if all that went on were the slightest bit funny , but virtually none of it is . 

the assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film , with the one big exception being a big laugh near the end . 

alas , the joke--a rather lazy takeoff on _jerry_maguire_--will only strike a chord with people who have seen that film . 

granted , a lot of people _have_ seen _jerry_maguire_ , but the fact that the film's best joke is completely dependent on one's familiarity with another film says a lot about _roxbury_'s lack of inspiration . 

that lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves . 

like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of _saturday_night_live_ , "" the roxbury guys "" is a one-joke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context . 

after watching one of the "" roxbury "" skits on snl , this is what you come away with from the characters : they bob their heads to "" what is love ? "" , 

bump unsuspecting women , and . . . that's all . 

after watching _a_night_at_the_roxbury_ , you'll be left with exactly the same .

"one of kyle mclachlan's earlier cinematic features , this movie has had an obvious influence on such films as the terminator ( 8/10 ) , species ( 7/10 ) and the more recent , fallen with denzel washington . 

plot : a science-fiction picture set in modern times , this thriller follows the exploits of an "" entity "" from outer space , who likes to inhabit human bodies , use them up until they are completely worn out , and then switch over to the next available receptacle . 

fbi agent ( mclachlan ) and local top cop ( nouri ) are charged with the capture of this "" thing "" before it's too late . 

critique : this fast-paced , urban equivalent of the thing ( 8/10 ) , checks in on all cylinders for ultra-violence ( god knows how many people died in this movie ) , action and an overall rock 'n roll attitude . 

then again , how can you go wrong with an "" alien "" that likes the ferraris , guns , heavy metal music and sexy girls ? ! 

granted , the plot isn't the most elaborate of tales ( alien bad , find alien , kill alien ) , but i can honestly say that i was never once bored during the viewing of this entire picture . 

i wouldn't recommend it to those who don't like car chases , murders , and bland acting , but for all the rest of you out there , those who enjoy putting away their brains every now and again , sitting back , slamming back some salsa'd nachos , and relishing in the cheeze some call film . . . 

have a blast ! ! 

two scenes to watch for are both within the first ten minutes of this gore-fest . 

the opening sequence is one of the most rockin' scenes to open any action movie , and the subsequent extra-terrestrial "" transformation "" is another eye-catcher . 

even the late 80's special effects were okay . 

followed by the hidden ii in 1994 . 

little known facts : this film was kyle maclachlan's first non-david lynch foray into the world of feature films .

"plunkett & macleane marks the directing debut of jake scott , brother of ridley and tony . 

naturally , this got me worried . 

would jake's talent be inherited from ridley or tony ? 

if it was from ridley , than the movie would be a thoughtful suspensor with action thrown in . 

if it was from tony , it would be wham bang drivel . 

unfortunately , the latter is true for this worthless picture with little charm . 

carlyle and miller are the titular highwaymen , plunkett ( carlyle ) who is poor and unruly , and captain james macleane ( miller ) a clean cut gentleman . 

as the tagline clearly wants to make known , they rob the rich and nothing else . 

the film basically follows the rowdy hold ups the two stage , along with romantic interludes with lady rebecca ( tyler . ) 

hot on both their tails is mr chance ( ken stott ) who wants to see them both dead . 

plunkett & macleane is an annoying little film that serves little purpose . 

although undoubtedly slick and fast paced , there's very little merit contained in the film . 

carlyle and miller are fun enough as the foul mouthed pair , although their characters are criminally undeveloped . 

it appears that much of the money has been spent on the expensive looking sets and costumes , but not on the script . 

the five ( ! ) screenwriters ( three credited ) have produced an still born movie : there's very little development in the story . 

also , major events , such as mr . cash finding out who plunkett and macleane really are , are so rushed that they barely happened . 

the story is a bit of a mess , frankly . 

the performances aren't bad : carlyle and miller are typical lads , but liv tyler is a huge disappointment as the love interest . 

her irritable , stilted performance sticks out like a sore thumb , and i was quite unsure on what accent she was trying to put on . 

she looks nice , though . 

more interesting is alan cummings as the campy lord rochester , and although his character amounts to nothing more than a two dimensional comedy gay character , he hams it up well . 

ken stott is suitably evil as chance , but again he is nothing but a flat character . 

i didn't particularly care when the predictable death sequence arrived . 

although a disappointment in writing , and a minor success in acting , the film certainly look lavish , with good costumes , and wonderful sets . 

but production design alone can't save a movie , especially a movie as bad as this mess . 

jake scott would be more suited to directing a music video rather than this failed update of a period drama : the only update seems to be the fact that everyone must talk dirty , with 'f * ck this' and 'stand and f * cking deliver' splattered all over the place . 

the mtv editing and direction are flash enough , but in the end decidedly empty . 

plunkett & macleane is a massive disappointment . 

although somewhat enjoyable during parts , it's so light it could float off the screen if it wasn't just images on a reel . 

there's no thought , no development , no plot , just a series of manic edits and quirky camera angles to make this film appeal to gen-xers . 

although it's a great idea : update a period drama to the mtv generation : it's execution is awful , and would more likely bore than excite . 

sloppy and occasionally off puttingly tasteless , it's hard to recommend plunkett & macleane as a movie , but easy to recommend it as a overlong music video . 

give it a miss .

"the happy bastard's quick movie review 

analyze this 

how does one do a comedy focused on the mob ? 

well , a few years ago , there was a sly little comedy called the freshman , which had marlon brando doing a romp of a send-up of his famous don corleone character and , recently , the utterly stupid ( in a bad way ) movie mafia ! 

failed to really get the joke . 

this time around , however , warner bros . may have gotten it right with analyze this , a movie that hits its targets more than it misses . . . and 

for plenty of reasons . 

the story goes like this . 

a mobster ( robert deniro ) finds himself receiving several panic attacks as of late , fueled by the stress of an upcoming mobster meeting and a near-death following a drive-by shooting . 

it's these attacks that prompt him to hire a psychiatrist ( billy crystal ) who's mostly reluctant to take the mobster's case for two reasons . 

first , of course , he's a mobster , but secondly , he's trying to get married and enjoy a quiet honeymoon with his wife ( lisa kudrow ) and kid . 

and , of course , he can't rest worth for a moment because the mobster's goons are always needing the shrink for something , be it a quick consultation or dream analyzation . 

fortunately , the movie is played out for plenty of laughs . 

director harold ramis ( who also helmed the comedy multiplicity , which wasn't half bad ) keeps the tone peppy and light , even if it's sometimes sprinkled by slight dramatic moments ( shootings can't always be taken for laughs , you know ) . 

deniro does some of his finest comic work since the king of comedy , giving off a somewhat similar performance to his role in goodfellas , but with a bit of a lighter heart . 

 ( a scene where he tries to display his anger over the phone and fails miserably is hilarious . ) 

crystal plays an excellent straight man to deniro's character , uplifting him from such bombs as father's day and my giant . 

kudrow is also a hoot as crystal's wife-to-be , who's on the verge of a breakdown thanks to deniro's presence . 

is the movie perfect ? 

not really , thanks to a simplistic ending and some slightly wasted moments with a character portrayed by chazz palminteri ( he's a comic actor , too , come on , give him some more ! ) , but it is an enjoyable romp that lets deniro do something different but same for a change , taking his dramatic act to a new field of comedy . 

kudos to crystal and kudrow for not just making it his show , either . 

line of the movie : crystal : "" when you said you needed family therapy , this is not the family i had in mind ! "" 
"
"based on the novel set in 1914 by joseph conrad , victory spins a tale of a pair of lovers , heyst ( william dafoe ) and alma ( irene jacob ) , who seek refuge on heyst's isolated island . 

however , their idyllic world begins to crumble upon the arrival of mr jones ( sam neil ) , martin ricardo ( rufus sewell ) and their servant , pedro ( graziano marcelli ) , who have come to steal heyst's rumoured plunder . 

while the novel is largely complex in characterization , the film sadly transposes conrad's characters into lacklustre leads , the most disappointing being heyst himself . 

conrad's heyst adheres religiously to his late father's ways of detachment and isolation . 

his ascetic lifestyle is thrown into question when he meets alma , a helpless orchestra girl who charms him with her voice . 

the struggle to embrace the arrival of alma into his solitude , however , is lost in mark peploe's ( director and writer ) diluted version of heyst . 

without properly establishing the crucial details of heyst's character , all that is left of conrad's main character is a very shallow treatment of his internal conflict between detachment and human involvement . 

on the one hand , actualizing the subtext is a mammoth task ( though not impossible ) , but on the other hand , dafoe's flat acting cannot be excused as an attempt at stoicism . 

in the end , we are supposed to witness heyst renounce his philosophy and finally come to an understanding of what it is to love another . 

the final transformation , while perceptible , lacks the cathartic revelation which is undeniable in conrad's novel . 

its absence in the film is unforgivable . 

the film seems more concerned about moving the plot along when so much has yet to be said about the relationship between the two complete strangers . 

alma is supposed to have overcome great emotional barriers in the relationship , namely heyst's underlying philosophy of detachment , which heyst himself grapples with . 

the struggle against heyst's ignorance of true human involvement accounts for much of the greatness of alma's love for him . 

jacob , fair-skinned , gentle and yet passionate , handles the role with precision , detailing nuances where possible . 

unfortunately , she is let down by a superficial script . 

the couple's relationship develops too hastily , leaving all subtlety effaced and replaced with a blatant show-and-tell approach . 

all we know of the characters are mostly explained by their lines alone . 

this is unsatisfactory when so much of the turmoil experienced by the two stem from their buried thoughts and emotions . 

the sketchy handling of their relationship stands out as sorely as dafoe's american accent ( an inappropriate one since heyst spent most of his life in london ) . 

the other characters such as schomberg ( jean yanne ) , the owner of a hotel , and mr jones ( sam neill ) , also fall short of conrad's meticulous characterization . 

while schomberg should have been more menacing and vindictive , mr jones should have been portrayed as something more of an enigma . 

sam neil's caricature of a slightly stout , effeminate and soft-spoken gentleman-at-large nullifies the effect intended by conrad who describes mr jones as "" an insolent spectre on leave from hades , endowed with skin and bones and a subtle power of terror "" . 

poor characterization aside , kudos goes to rufus sewell for his excellent portrayal of ricardo , secretary to mr jones , a reckless ruffian capable of murder . 

sewell , with his cockney accent and large expressive green eyes , becomes the true terror of the unholy trinity , masterminding deceitful plans behind jones' back . 

at the same time , we are entertained by the foolhardiness of his plans . 

despite the authentic setting and marvellous cinematography by bruno de keyzer , very few images are left behind for us to savour after the film has ended . 

sourabaya and its surrounding islands and volcanoes may have their charm , but mean nothing once the film fails to capture the essence of an epic , which is what victory deserves to be . 

the delicately inter-woven complexities in the love story are lost to an inadequate production . 

at the end of the film , we are told that perhaps alma's victory was in teaching heyst how to love . 

a hollow victory indeed . 

the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video . 

 * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! 

 * * * pretty good , bring a friend . 

 * * * * amazing , potent stuff . 

 * * * * * perfection . 

see it twice . 
"
"truman ( "" true-man "" ) burbank is the perfect name for jim carrey's character in this film . 

president truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide , in spite of ( or was it because of ) his stature . 

 "" truman "" also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war , an era when planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans . 

and burbank , california , brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc . 

if hollywood is the center of the film world , burbank is , or was , the center of tv's world , the world where our protagonist lives . 

combine all these names and concepts into "" truman burbank , "" and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world . 

truman leads the perfect life . 

his town , his car , and his wife are picture perfect . 

his idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from the sky . 

the radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart . 

 . 

 . 

but then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light ? 

the next day during the drive to work , the radio jams and he starts picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements . 

he is so distracted that he nearly hits a pedestrian . 

when the radio comes back to normal , the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully . 

his suspicion aroused , he wanders around the town square looking for other oddities . 

the world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to take the elevator . 

the elevator doors open up on a small lounge with people on coffee breaks . 

a grip sees truman him and quickly moves a paneled door , made to look like the back of an elevator , into place . 

two security guards grab him and throw him out . 

truman is really suspicious now . 

it gets even worse the next day when his wife , a nurse , describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge . 

 "" it's best not to think about it , "" she says , trying vainly to change truman's memory . 

truman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense . 

at every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town . 

his last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world . 

you know by now that truman's life is the subject of a television program . 

his actions are "" real "" but everything else is carefully scripted , from the death of his father to the choice of his wife . 

truman is determined to find out what the big hoax is . 

meanwhile , christof , the all-seeing creator of truman's world does his best to keep him unaware and happy . 

it's sort of like westworld told from the robots' point of view , or jurassic park from the dinosaurs' point of view . 

we root for the captive of the cage-world . 

our protagonist is counting on "" chaos theory "" to help him escape his elaborate trap . 

the story , written by andrew niccol ( writer/director of gattaca ) , introduces some interesting questions , such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life , or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake . 

although these questions came to mind , i don't think the film itself asked them . 

it certainly didn't address them or try to answer them . 

i was particularly disappointed that the film didn't deal more with the trauma of learning one's life is a tv show . 

carrey's performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman's pain , but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film's pacing . 

earlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well . 

the two seemed exclusive of one another , but weir and niccol didn't see it that way . 

perhaps it's not fair to criticize a movie for what it isn't , but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here . 

but on its own terms , the movie is well made . 

sight , sound and pacing are all handled competently . 

much of the first part of the movie is the truman show . 

the scenes are all apparently shot from hidden cameras , with snoots and obstructions covering the corners of the screen . 

one hidden camera is apparently in his car radio , the green led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen . 

the music is well-chosen and scored . 

the film opens with what sounds like family drama theme music , when truman's world is still beautiful and perfect . 

when the movie ends , the score sounds more like a frantic , driven , tangerine dream opus , while still keeping the same timbre . 

philip glass' epic music ( from powaqqatsi ) permeates truman's scenes of suspicion and awakening . 

 ( glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show . ) 

and the pacing of the story was brisk . 

there was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show , just a few quick title cards , a few interviews , and then right into the show , and the movie . 

one of the first scenes is of the studio light falling ; there was no token scene of truman's idyllic life before it falls apart , because it wasn't necessary , we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble , and no sooner . 

there's also no point in the movie where the plot slows down . 

it's a quick , straight shot to the movie's end . 

in terms of overall quality , i would compare the truman show to niccol's gattaca . 

both films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worlds . 

but neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas ; neither film "" clicked "" and became an instant classic . 

nevertheless , i look forward to niccol's next film , whatever it may be . 
"
"everything in the phantom you have seen many times before and there is nothing new presented here . 

wincer displays absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action sequence . 

billy zane is wooden as the hero . 

kristy swanson is given very little to do , and does very little with it . 

treat williams , looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse , is one of the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie . 

only catherine zeta jones , as one of williams cohorts turns in a good performance . 

she has energy and spunk , which the movie needed much more of . 

oh yeah , the phantom also has a secret identity but this is so poorly played out you won't even care . 

about the only things i can recommend are a good performance by jones , and some colorful scenery . 

however , if youre looking for a fun family movie , go watch the underrated flipper . 

this is not a good movie .

"plot summary : the year is 2024 . 

the ozone layer has long since gone and the earth is now protected from radiation by a shield invented by connor mccleod . 

the shield , although saving lives , has made the atmosphere hot and humid . 

connor is a mortal and a tired old man who has given up hope . 

on returning from the opera one night connor is accosted by the leader of a "" terrorist "" organisation . 

they have tried to find out what the company that now runs the shield unit are covering up . 

connor is then attacked by two assassins sent by katana from the planet zeist ( like zeit--get it ? ) . 

they fail and connor becomes immortal again by chopping their heads off . 

he then brings ramirez back to life in glencoe in scotland . 

both ramirez and connor are rebel leaders back on zeist and have been sent to earth as punishment . 

connor now has the option to return being the last one but opts to stay with his new found immortality and fight to find out about the company and the shield . 

katana meanwhile , fearing connor would return , sets out himself to kill the highlander . 

if you have never seen it . 

being a fan of highlander and mr . connery , i was in the cinema as soon as i could to see highlander ii : the quickening . 

i wish it had been quicker . 

i feel whatever else you can say about a film ( bad script bad music , etc . ) if you sit just plain bored through most of it then nothing much else needs to be said . 

the film was short but in my opinion only twelve minutes or so ( the time mr . connery is on the screen for ) is worth watching . 

the plot sounds a little ridiculous but i was willing to give it a chance . 

maybe they could pull it off . 

instead , i find that the characters have completely changed from those in the first film . 

it's as if they are different people with the same names . 

witness connor jumping into bed with the leader of the resistance -- where is the attitude of "" who wants to live forever , when love must die "" gone to ? 

the love sub-plot * must * have had footage cut out . 

the highlander and ramirez both seemed aware of powers they had never mentioned before . 

putting our heroes in deadly situations and then having them walk away because of some new power is very annoying . 

i still want to know why connor's coat becomes flame proof when he is immortal ! 

we are not given enough time on zeist to believe in it , nor are we told why advanced aliens still use swords to kill . 

why not dynamite or laser saws or just plain bullets followed by a quick chop to the neck ? 

i know the head needs to come off but you could at least immobilise your opponent with laser rifles first . 

to be fair one assassin tried this but he must be the world's worst shot . 

meanwhile connor develops luke-skywalker-like powers of laser beam deflection . 

as for "" bad guys , "" we see a rebellion on zeist , crushed easier than a grape and then the rest of the plot depends on katana being obsessed with killing mccleod in case he returns to zeist . 

two assassins are sent , presumably they are meant to be good at killing but an aged connor kills them both with no problems . 

no more assassins are sent . 

katana , supposedly a very powerful man goes himself to kill connor . 

has he no more assassins ? 

has he no better ? 

why was the rebellion crushed so easily then ? 

michael ironside is totally unconvincing ( bring back the kurgan ) . 

he seems like a cartoon character and really isn't that evil , just stupid and violent . 

we see the hollywood trick of the chief nasty threatening a child again and killing lots of innocents . 

yet he still seems like no threat -- perhaps because he seems too stupid to threaten connor , or maybe because his two best assassins wouldn't have been amiss with larry , curly and mo . 

so much for plot and characters . 

the music is atrocious . 

it is at best intrusive and at worst annoying . 

bring back queen . 

there was an audible sigh ( of relief ? ) 

when connor played a queen track in a juke box . 

i believe this at least is to be corrected for the american release . 

the acting is at best flat , except for mr . connery . 

lambert is uninteresting and when he delivered "" there can be only one "" this time around it just made me wish there had only been one -- highlander . 

michael ironside is unconvincing ; sorry , michael , i usually like you and everyone else was incredibly forgetable . 

so why 2/10 ? 

visually the film is interesting at all times . 

it has a blade runner feel to it and some of the special effects are quite stunning . 

add to this an irrepressible sean connery who smiles throughout the whole film -- or is he smirking to himself ? 

his lines and delivery might make the film worthwhile had it not been so obvious that he cannot take the whole thing seriously at all but hey -- * i'd * have done it for 12 million . 

oh , and i agree with a previous reviewer , she * does * look like sharon stone but i believe it is her first film . 

incidentally there is a line producer credited and i hear rumours of highlander iii : the wizard .

"seen at the 21st portland international film festival 

film title : supermarket woman director : juzo itami country : japan 1997 cinematography : yonezo maeda music : toshiyuki honda cast : nobuko miyamoto , masahitko tsugawa , shiro ito , yuji miyake , akiko matsumoto super features : typical itami film . . . 

funny and pointed in its own way . 

if you don't care how and what the food you buy goes through in your local supermarket , then this film is not for you . . . . 

maybe it is better to ignore it , as this strong and biting satire , as only juzo itami can deliver , will give you an insight as to what some foods go through . 

having , in the past , made films that pulled every punch imaginable , from the family traditions ( the funeral ) , to taxes ( a taxing woman & a taxing woman returns ) , to the diabolical gangsters ( minbo ) , to hospitals ( the seriously ill ) , juzo itami , this time takes on the supermarkets' own war , to get the consumers . 

and while this film has its funny side , in the crazy situations that it creates , it also shows another side , which is very much the attitude of a corporate structure that is more concerned with its profits than it is with any customer . 

goro has a supermarket . 

and a competitor comes into the neighborhood , trying to take him out of business by providing less expensive prices for everything that is sold in the supermarket . 

bargains galore , its name , has in mind the closure of goro's humbler venue , so that in the end it can mark up its prices in any way it can . 

goro hires hanako , a housewife whose talents seem to be better suited to management , than they are in anything else . 

hanako , as she gets familiar with the operation , discovers many of the tricks of the trade , done by many of the elders in charge of each section of the market . 

and the procedures , are not always "" fresh "" food , but a new packaging and a new date , to try and convince the customers that quality is on the shelves . 

hanako's ideas take hold , starting with a few of the women that work in the supermarket , being that they do not even shop there at all . 

and hanako discovers along the way that a few giveaways here and there make a bit of a difference . 

if not cause some serious problems in the running of the store . 

a price error , forces them to give away eggs for very low prices , and causes the store a few hassles , but , it brought the people in , and everyone knows that these customers will buy a few other things . 

as the operation gets stronger , the competition also has trickery up its sleeve , and it has been undermining much of the operation by paybacks to one of the store managers , as well as the meat and fish elder supervisors . 

eventually these people are found out , and hanako has to tread slowly and carefully , until in the end they all have a showdown . 

and here , the truth and honesty win out , and even one of the elders decides to stay rather than go to work for the corrupt opponent . 

in the process , they also find that "" freshness "" ( with some very funny jokes on this word as well ) becomes a much more important tool than they imagined . 

with some very nice performances , in this hectic , and fast paced film , this film gives us a sitting of two hours that is satisfying in many ways , although a failed love story between goro and hanako does not come off much , even though towards the end it is suggested . 

but this would take away from the satire and its strengths . 

with food gags all over the place , the film lets you have it . 

and what fun it is . 

worth seeing . 

 ( editorial ) the director of this film , juzo itami , died shortly after the film was finished , and he left behind a legacy of comedy and satire that is rare , and uncompromising . 

we would wish that he had been able to make one about film making , of which he must have had a few stories to tell , but we will have to do with much of the japanese society , and its many errant ways . . . . 

not to say that these things do not happen anywhere else . . . . 

america is no less guilty of any of these subjects at all , should anyone have the guts to tackle it . . . 

we could learn something along the way , too . . . . 

worth seeing , specially , is a taxing woman and its follow up a taxing woman returns . 

the funeral is also good , although not as funny as the later films . 

tampopo is also very enjoyable . 

all four of these films are available in video , which means your best local site for foreign film may have them . . . 

ask for it .

"fritz lang's first american film since leaving nazi germany , is an eye-opener about a lynch mob in a small town . 

joe wilson ( spencer tracy ) is a regular joe , a hard-working stiff , a decent guy , who is living with his two brothers , tom ( walcott ) and charlie ( albertson ) , in chicago . 

he is engaged to katherine grant ( sylvia sidney ) , but can't save up enough money to marry her . 

she takes the train west for a better paying job as a teacher . 

before she departs , she gives him the wedding ring her father gave to her mother , sews up his ripped trench coat , corrects him when he mistakingly says the wrong word for memento , and kisses him goodbye . 

a year goes by and joe buys a car and tells katherine that he will meet her to get married in capitol city , that he has quit his job and hopes to open a gas station . 

driving through the rural backroads and camping out at night while going to met her , he arrives at a near-by town called strand . 

but the deputy sheriff "" buggs "" meyers ( walter brennan ) comes upon him waving a shotgun and arrests him . 

he accuses him of the kidnapping of a little girl . 

the sheriff ( ellis ) finds salted peanuts on him just like the kidnapper had in his pocket , he also has a five dollar bill on him that matches one of the numbers of the ransom money , and he fits the general description of the suspect . 

locked in jail , he waits for the district attorney to look at his claim of innocence . 

in the local bar , the town citizens go into a rage when learning that an arrest has been made in the kidnapping . 

fueled by angry talk about getting back at the kidnapper and of having the deputy inadvertently telling them of the ransom money found on the suspect , a mob storms the jail , burns it down and dynamites it when they can't get through to the prisoner's jail cell . 

the sheriff called the governor for the national guard , but one of his political advisers countermanded that request , saying it wouldn't look right for the governor in an election year to call out troops for those he wants to vote for him . 

somehow joe escapes , but his dog rainbow dies . 

katherine hears what has happened on the radio and rushes to the neighboring town of strand only to see him engulfed by flames in his cell , and becomes convinced that he died . 

the next day the newspapers announce that the guilty kidnapper confesses . 

joe makes his way back to chicago and tells his brothers , who are startled to see him alive , that he wants revenge . 

he thereby supplies his brothers with the names of the 22 leaders in the lynch mob . 

an ambitious district attorney ( walter abel ) prosecutes the 22 for murder . 

katherine , not knowing he's alive , remains in a state of shock , but is asked to be a witness that she saw joe burning to death . 

the defense claims that it can't be a charge of murder without a corpse . 

the trial proves to be interesting , as the citizens in this close-knit , respectable community , lie under oath , providing alibis for each other to prove they couldn't have been at the jail . 

the sheriff also lies , saying he can't identify anyone in the mob . 

but proof comes by way of a newsreel cameraman who caught the whole incident on film . 

as for proof of the corpse , an anonymous letter is addressed to the judge enclosed with the wedding ring katherine gave joe . 

in the note , memento is misspelled , which makes katherine realize that joe is alive . 

when the sentence is announced , 20 of the accused are found guilty of murder , but joe marches into the courtroom and gives a pious speech about what happened . 

katherine forgives him , and this very strong film ends on a weaker note than i think it should have . 

but don't blame lang for all the changes in the film , of trying to take the town off the hook by introducing this wild revenge motive . 

mgm couldn't bear to have it made the way lang wanted it , that is , by having tracy die in the lynching . 

instead they wanted to stop short of condemning so many small american towns where lynchings actually do occur , and they thereby meddled throughout the entire script . 

to lang's credit , even if this film failed to be a masterpiece because of the interference , it still did not let the good citizens off the moral hook . 

his portrayal of the attempted lynching was powerfully done and was not compromised . 

you couldn't help get the feeling that the citizens didn't care that much that they almost lynched an innocent man , but cared more about protecting the reputation of their town and would do anything to keep their 22 vigilantes from going to jail , even perjuring themselves . 

their reaction to seeing joe alive was satisfying only in that it meant they weren't going to be convicted . 

lang by no means implies that the town has learned its lesson from this incident . 

he does imply that a dark side to joe wilson has been exposed , and the innocent , jovial good-guy , seen in the beginning of the film , has been largely altered forever by this traumatic experience . 
"
"on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento's much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with . 

in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his "" giallo "" murder mysteries . 

while it's certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller . 

the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book "" tenebrae "" . 

with the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems . 

the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa . 

he brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real-life horror around him . 

the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension . 

argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business . 

tenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento's scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here . 

it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play . 

in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes . 

needless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director's brilliance as a stylist . 

many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork . 

they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria . 

instead , tenebrae's set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world . 

and the soundtrack's mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment . 

so tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question . 

still , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative . 

some critics argue that logic doesn't matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don't deserve to feel cheated . 

by the way , if you don't want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs . 

about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious . 

we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none other than the author peter neal . 

he is insane , apparently . 

the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it's time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife . 

he is finally revealed to us as this "" second killer "" in the film's bloody climax . 

but argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively . 

you see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer's house . 

but thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway . 

bad cutting puts the timing way out . 

in other words , he's almost in two places at once . 

during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring . 

by the film's end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant . 

the injury ? 

he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock ! 

thus , the revelation of the "" hero "" as a killer ( and anti-hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking , but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled . 

helpfully , in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along . 

but there too is a problem , as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least . 

the story owes us a better understanding of franciosa's mind , his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage . 

tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies . 

for instance , a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike . 

we would assume the rider is the same boy , but it turns out to be some male character we aren't even introduced too ! 

that's careless filmmaking , pure and simple . 

why , you may ask , do i go on about the story's flaws ? 

because when it comes to visuals and set pieces , argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world . 

take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae . 

an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence and chases her across town . 

finally , as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine , she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer's lair . 

it's an absolutely masterful sequence , tense and exciting , and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone . 

and that's exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating . 

too often , it seems , argento's films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts . 

mind you , if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look . 

and if you're a fan of argento's unique style of giallo thriller then it's essential . 

see the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli . 

it's a stylish , great-looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative . 

a shame , because it doesn't have to be that way . 

take argento's more recent stendhal syndrome ( 1992 ) , where with the aid of co-writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache . 

proof that he can do it , if he tries . . .

"wyatt earp has a lot to tell and little to say . 

this story of the legendary lawman runs three hours and nine minutes and that's too long for this epic-wannabe that plays more like a tv mini-series than a movie . 

the story opens on the earp family farm , with young wyatt ready to run away from home . 

he wants to fight in the civil war , but his dad ( hackman ) has different ideas and wants his son to study law . 

time passes and wyatt heads west , returns home to marry , and , after a spell , begins his career in law enforcement . 

by the time he ( costner ) and his brothers ( madsen , david andrews , and linden ashby ) arrive in tombstone , wyatt has tried his hand at everything from hunting buffalo to dealing cards . 

wyatt earp is very appealing in places-- such as cast , costumes , and cinematography-- but an overstated story and overpowered score deaden most of the emotional impact . 

who can be moved by scene after scene after scene of swelling strings and suffocating speeches ? 

somber is fine-- just ask clint eastwood-- but this film that boasts not one , not two , but three , count 'em three , hammy death scenes ! 

still , a little bit of earp goes a long way and the life and times of the legendary lawman are from uninteresting stuff . 

his , uh , unusual relations with women , for example , are an intriguing contrast to his character's credo of "" nothing counts as much as blood . "" 

equally amusing is a buffalo-hunting ( and skinning ! ) 

sequence that is decidedly non-pc . 

director lawrence kasdan takes a refreshingly realistic approach to the gunplay . 

the infamous gunfight at the ok corral is both brutal and brief , devoid of almost any theatrics . 

don't look for much glorified violence here . 

despite some large exclamation points in the story , the characters * do * come to life . 

the diverse cast includes everyone from betty buckley ( ! ) to mackenzie astin ( ! ! ) . 

kevin costner is very good in the title role . 

dances with whitney nevers get as steely as the role requires , though , but his transformation from lighthearted law student to stoic sheriff is fun to watch . 

he was tougher in a perfect world . 

his foil is dennis quaid , who pulled a deniro by losing 40+ pounds to play the tubercular terror doc holliday . 

gaunt * and * gamely , he's a scene stealer who's seen too little . 

other familiar faces include tom sizemore ( looking like bruce mcgill ) , bill pullman ( looking like jeff daniels ) , and lea thompson ( looking like someone other than lea thompson ) . 

both gene hackman and isabella rosselini appear and disappear like magic , while late entries catherine o'hara and jobeth williams are surprisingly solid . 

though the story and score should've tried "" less is more , "" all other credits are technical tops . 

production designer ida random , art director gary wissner , and costume designer colleen atwood are some of the vips who helped spend what must've been an enormous budget . 

clearly no expense was spared .

"quiz show , an almost perfectly accurate true story , is based upon the events of the popular television show of the mid-50's , "" twenty-one "" . 

on this trivial game show , contestants were placed in isolation booths and then answered questions corresponding to a category of their choice , on which they wagered an amount of points on . 

the game went on until a player reached twenty one points on felt they had earned enough points to win . 

but , after ratings began to fall when players were struggling to break the zero mark , the producers decided to fix the game by giving the answers to a contestant before the game began . 

quiz show illustrates the true stories of two particular contestants , herbie stempel and charles van doren . 

stempel ( john turturro ) , a former g . i . 

and your jewish man raising a family . 

stempel has been the reigning champion on "" twenty-one "" for many weeks and has accumulated thousands of dollars . 

in his mind , he is the best thing on television and the people love him . 

although , in the mind of the show's producers , herbie stempel is getting old . 

dan enright ( david paymer ) , in particular , feels that the people are tired of seeing a "" jewish guy from queens with bad teeth "" and that the kids need someone better to look up to . 

therefore , they need to find another contestant whom would be a worthy role model and the people will look up to and cheer to win . 

someone who can defeat stempel , even if they have to resort to cheating . 

enter charles van doren ( ralph fiennes ) , a well-educated professor from a widely recognized family . 

van doren had decided to try out for the game show "" tic tac dough "" because his friends thought he would be good at that sort of thing . 

but when albert freedman ( hank azaria ) , enright's assistant , spots van doren , the two decide that they have found their soon-to-be-ruler of the "" twenty-one "" kingdom . 

van doren is not too keen on the idea of receiving the answers ahead of time , so enright tells stempel that he is going to give the wrong answer , on purpose , in order to lose the game . 

after stempel loses the "" throne "" to van doren , he starts to feel cheated ( which he should ) . 

meanwhile , on his own , dick goodwin ( rob morrow ) , a harvard law graduate , has decided to start an investigation on "" twenty-one "" to try and find out if there have been any wrongdoings . 

his investigation yields shocking results and leads to a trial for enright and the others involved . 

quiz show is an extremely well done movie , and robert redford's direction is especially superb . 

the performances turned in by john turturro , ralph fiennes , and rob morrow are very good , although it seems that turturro stands out more than any . 

quiz show is also very precise when it comes to explicating the true events that inspired the film . 

definitely a film you should not miss .

"this movie about two dysfunctional families never really gets off the ground , despite some good performances from a basically competent cast . 

eddie ( sean penn ) and maureen ( robin wright penn ) are a not-so-happily married couple down on their luck . 

living in rented rooms in the seedier part of an unnamed city , they spend what little income they have at the local bar , owned by shorty ( stanton ) , eddie's best friend , and his wife georgie ( mazar ) . 

maureen and eddie share an odd relationship marked by eddie's frequent disappearances . 

on his return , he promises her the world and professes his undying love . 

their manic reunions all too soon lead to new lows , as eddie disappears again . 

like a junky craving the next high , maureen suffers through the lows to reach the next high . 

their relationship is further complicated by maureen's pregnancy . 

she wants the baby and the father , but deep down seems to sense the inevitability of losing the latter . 

during one of eddie's absences , maureen is attacked by kiefer , her neighbor , who gets her drunk ( with her cooperation ) and then insists on intimacy . 

she leaves badly bruised and in fear of what eddie might do -- not to her , but to kiefer . 

she lies about what happens to ensure that no harm will come to eddie as the result of his inevitable rage . 

he lashes out as she expects , and ends up in an institution for what he believes to be 3 months -- but in reality is 10 years . 

during this decade , maureen divorces eddie and remarries a more solid and reliable individual , joey ( travolta , in a small role ) . 

her life falls apart again when eddie is released from the institution and comes to find her . 

joey insists on bringing eddie into his home and making his wife choose between her husband ( and father of two children ) and stability ( joey makes a good living , drives a cadillac , and they live in a large house in the suburbs ) and the love of her previous life . 

she chooses her past , and sacrifices not only her new life but her old ( by giving up her and eddie's daughter to joey ) . 

but the eddie that she knew is gone , replaced by a mere shell of the man he was . 

maureen is herself a mere shell , more an automaton than a woman -- as if she had gone through whatever therapy and treatment eddie was given along with him . 

perhaps these two really do need each other and can find happiness ( or maybe the lack of sadness ) together , but the movie's denouement was not convincing . 
"
"there is a striking scene early in "" city of angels , "" where all the angels who live unseen in our midst , gather at the beach to watch the sun rise . 

the camera moves above them , showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women , all garbed in black . 

then the camera moves in on the face of seth , an angel played by nicolas cage , and as the sun rises , he smiles and his entire face lights up . 

you see , the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets , but they cannot feel a human touch . 

it is an important scene for several reasons . 

first of all , it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible . 

the film presents these fantastic beings as normal-looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth , watching what goes on with little interference . 

there are none of the standard , hokey angel references used in recent films like "" angels in the outfield "" ( 1994 ) or "" michael "" ( 1996 ) . 

the angels here are stark and believable . 

this early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition , for its shows how god's angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot , and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures , like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs , or the smell of the salt in the air . 

there is an inherent tragedy in being an angel , although there is much beauty in it as well . 

they eternally walk the earth , listening to our thoughts , touching us in our pain , and leading the dying to heaven . 

like human existence , being an angel is often confused and unsure . 

 "" city of angels "" is essentially a love story , between seth and a human , a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan ) . 

he first sees her when he is in her operating room , waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven . 

maggie is distraught , doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table , and seth is moved by her efforts and , more importantly , her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies . 

angels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain , and seth does what he can with his invisible touch , but it's not enough . 

he wants to be with her and share her pain , not just stand back at a distance . 

he learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to "" fall "" and become human . 

he learns this from another fallen angel , played by dennis franz ( "" n . y . p . d . 

blue "" ) in a touching and humorous performance . 

sitting at a diner together , franz tells cage's character about how wonderful it is to be human - to be able to taste food , feel another person's skin , smell the air , and most importantly , have a loving wife and children . 

of course , there is pain to go along with all this , but for seth , it will be worth it . 

 "" city of angels "" is something of a reinterpretation of wim wender's haunting 1988 film "" wings of desire . "" 

wenders' film was more like a poem - it was the feeling , the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened . 

the americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles , and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human . 

and , unlike most foreign films that are re-made into hollywood fare , it doesn't suffer extensive damage . 

this may be because director brad silberling ( "" casper "" ) and screenwriter dana stevens ( "" blink "" ) wanted to make "" city of angels "" its own movie - inspired by "" wings of desire , "" but not an attempt to copy it . 

and yet , "" city of angels "" is not a typical hollywood movie . 

it is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale ( "" the english patient "" ) , whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world . 

seale creates many striking visuals : in addition to the beach scene , there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around , looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by . 

while the film travels along a charted plot , it takes time to develop its characters and situations ; it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly , and shows just how thin those boundaries are . 

both cage and ryan give soulful , soft-spoken performances . 

ryan , who is usually so bouncy and energetic , truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch . 

cage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple , heartfelt gazes , and speaks with the comforting , knowing voice that only an angel could have . 

what is most striking about "" city of angels "" is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay , which is both unexpected and challenging . 

it's not a formulaic hollywood ending , because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time . 

it doesn't give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance . 

instead , it offers something much better , something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive .

"much ado about nothing . 

ah , how sweet the irony ! 

it's accepted wisdom in some circles - among english literature nuts , mainly - that whenever a critic knocks shakespeare they are only doing so through ignorance . 

he just doesn't "" understand "" shakespeare , you will hear them say . 

the bard's work is apparently beyond criticism . 

what a load of old cobblers . 

if these arbiters of public taste think kenneth branaugh's film of shakespeare's "" comedy "" much ado about nothing is comedy in any modern sense of the word , it's time to get a life . 

get monty python . 

get woody allen . 

get john waters . 

whatever . 

just get a real taste of some clever , witty , risky comedy . 

and banish this nonsense to where it belongs . 

drama and tragedy was shakespeare's strength . 

to my sensibilities - and i'm no stick in the mud - much ado about nothing resonates with no spark whatsoever . 

no kidding : this film ranks among the most embarrassing two hours i have ever spent in a cinema in my 20 years of movie going . 

the only thing that stopped me walking out was loyalty to my lady friend , as this was our day out and i hadn't seen her in ages . 

but boy , does she owe me one ! 

i won't spend too much time on the plot . 

basically , we follow the trials and tribulations of two would-be couples - one young , the other older . 

there's some dark treachery amongst all this , but everyone is so awfully jolly that you'd hardly know it . 

mind you , there's nothing wrong with the basic story . 

good romantic comedies based on similar premises abound . 

nothing wrong with most of the cast , either . 

branaugh , emma thompson and denzel washington are all talented performers . 

the problem is the script , or more accurately , shakespeare's original text . 

light comedy shouldn't be complex . 

yet wrapped in elizabethan english , the dialogue becomes difficult to comprehend . 

for this alone it will be a problem for modern audiences unschooled in shakespeare and in search of nothing more than a good , undemanding laugh . 

the only laughs to escape my belly were brought on by the gloriously inept performance of keanu reeves , the actor once again miscast as a jealous half-brother or something . 

but when dissected and understood , what it all boils down to is that this stuff is just so goddamn lame . 

this is comedy so clean and nice and corny and so devoid of danger that it leaves this viewer totally cold . 

ho , ho , ho , boy likes girl ! 

ho , ho , ho , men are such klutzes ! 

ho , ho , ho , she's so awfully clumsy ! 

oh please ! 

there's wit in here somewhere , i'm told . 

i call it pretentious . 

something lightweight striving to be something sophisticated through clever wordplay . 

in the end , it's cringeworthy . 

watching some of the cinema patrons around me collapse with laughter made much ado about nothing a very weird movie going experience . 

comedy ? 

bah , humbug !

"because the press screening of "" planet of the apes "" was one day past last issue's deadline , i was afforded the opportunity to see the film a second time , listen to audience reactions and read a heap of reviews before writing this piece . 

the chief complaints of those who disliked the futuristic adventure appear to be that the movie focused on visuals instead of substance , that the story was thin , that mark wahlberg's character was colorless and that the surprise ending sucked . 

to those people i would like to say ? what the hell did you expect ? 

this is a tim burton movie , boys and girls . 

tim burton movies have great art direction and thin , clunky stories . 

for the blissfully nasty , disjointed and underrated "" mars attacks ! "" 

 ( jonathan rosenbaum of the chicago reader and i were two of the only critics in america to praise the movie ) burton reportedly tossed vintage "" mars attacks ! "" 

trading cards onto the floor and based his story on the ones that landed face up . 

burton's re-imagining of the 1968 story of an astronaut that lands on a planet where apes rule men looks great . 

the apes , courtesy of make-up magician rick baker , are dazzling and ape city is a wonder to behold . 

like astronaut leo davidson ( wahlberg ) , the film hits the ground running , whisking viewers through a head-spinning series of solid one-liners and engaging vignettes and establishing a sense of thrust that carries us through the more traditional fight scenes that come later . 

as for wahlberg , consider what burton does with his character . 

from his start as a filmmaker , burton has shown his fascination with colorful misfits ( pee-wee herman , the joker , ed wood , the ack-acking martians , etc . ) and lack of interest in standard issue heroes . 

so leo davidson spends most of the movie getting the living shit kicked out of him before the biggest guilt trip in history is dropped on his shoulders . 

as for lack of color , remember , leo only launches into space to get his monkey back . 

he doesn't want to lead humanity and he isn't looking for romance from a pretty , but dull human ( estella warren ) or a dynamic ape ( helena bonham carter , terrific as an equal-rights activist ) . 

as a man who just wants out , wahlberg is focused , subtle and sly . 

the surprise ending provides the requisite shock ( and some more dandy visuals , particularly of the approaching authority figures ) , but admittedly isn't nearly as satisfying as the one in the original . 

for the original ending to work , we only had to make one simple connection , for this one , we have to write a whole new screenplay . 

the 1968 "" apes "" boasted a handful of great scenes , cool looking monkeys , a deliciously hammy performance by charlton heston ( who appears uncredited here as an aged chimp on his deathbed , re-delivering a classic line ) and a killer ending . 

but viewers had to suffer through numerous dull stretches punctuated by social and political messages delivered with the grace of a wrecking ball . 

the 2001 "" planet of the apes "" offers a different set of great scenes , much cooler looking monkeys , fine acting from wahlberg , bonham carter , paul giamatti and tim roth , and a not so good ending . 

it also gives us another chance to experience the skewed vision of tim burton and that's nothing to complain about .

"while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation , we had yet another shoddy , subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks . 

and , once again , we have one of the worst films of the year . 

the trend of the moment-- and bear in mind it's a trend not a movie - is spawn , and if you've seen the animated series on hbo you'll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man , an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment : he's been sent to hell . 

todd mcfarlane , the creator of the spawn comic book , must have had a tough time sitting through spawn , for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects , style over substance , ambience over anything else . 

not only does spawn rely entirely on special effects , the story , about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of * bad guys * and * find himself * in the process is realized in such a sordid , incapable manner , it becomes indigestible after a while . 

every character in this film is lifeless , vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student . 

the story begins , like in every superhero movie in this age , with a man living an idyllic life . 

al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government agent/assassin shares the love of his wife , wanda ( theresa russell ) and daughter , has a tongue-in-cheek , wiseass partner , terry ( d . b sweeney ) and is content with the job his boss , jason wynn ( martin sheen ) , provides him . 

the next element in the film is the part when things go awry . 

and as expected , everyone turns the tables on poor al . 

as the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant , al is befriended by jason , and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene . 

inevitably , it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away . 

hence , jason's mischievous master-mind plan , to ` conquer the world "" is just commencing its initial stages , when al makes a pact with satan himself , agreeing to command the devil's army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again . 

so , our pal al has been uplifted to hell , and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place , his ol' partner terry forms a relationship with his wife . 

time passes . 

and now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city , the ghetto where cog ( nicol williamson ) teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts , his motorbike , armor , etc . . . 

this character is merely a poor man's obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla . 

now the stage is set spawn , the new `enemy of evil' vs evil . 

and evil takes the cake , doubtlessly . 

john leguizamo's deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film's relief point . 

all this anguish , pain , half-baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo , who steals the show and derives joy from his character , which is basically a compilation of so-so one liners . 

and then there's martin sheen . 

whichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years . 

his selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent . 

as the megalomaniac boss , his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a b-movie , scrambled , and left in the shelf to rot . 

this is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street . 

i'd never thought i'd be saying this , but at this juncture , charlie sheen's career is in better shape . 

spawn is a movie in which realism , or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable . 

for most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling , jumping through roofs , and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better . 

it constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie-- a very bad superhero movie . 

continually the film kept on depending on special effects , and sadly , this is how pictures are being made . 

perhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry . 

the filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible . 

the quality of this film is abysmal and insulting . 

it is perceptible that director mark dippe , attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton's batman did touch , the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act . 

but bruce wayne had human elements to him . 

he was pensive , resourceful and had relationships , which made our perspective on him equally human . 

the character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change , as if he's fatigued about being normal . 

and as all superheroes , batman , superman , the phantom , they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary . 

none of this is present in spawn . 

the fighting sequences are weakly executed , the dialogue is penny-dreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner's . 

as an example of this film's vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten , and then rescued by spawn , so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic . 

admittedly , i did laugh once in the film , and that's when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum . 

it is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature . 

besides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system , i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn . 

movies that present no admiration , no captivation , no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to . 

and kids will continue to see films like spawn , simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative , wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one . 

children are not muppets . 

and spawn unapologetically targets children . 
"
" "" the tailor of panama "" is a different kind of spy movie . 

despite the presence of pierce brosnan , there is nary a hint of james bond flash here . 

instead of big action scenes , leering super villains and empty-headed femme fatales , we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation . 

based on the novel by john le carr ? , who also co-wrote the screenplay , the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year : a solid , well-told story . 

brosnan plays andy osnard , a british operative walking on thin ice . 

his british superiors ship him off to panama , making sure he understands that he had better not screw up the placement . 

osnard arrives in the tropics virtually oozing contempt for his new co-workers and his new home base . 

when shown the bridge of the americas by a person marveling over the fact that , since the creation of the panama canal , the structure is the sole connection between north and south america , he barely keeps from yawning . 

brosnan clearly relishes the chance to be the antithesis of 007 , investing the suave spy with a distinct reptilian quality coupled with an air of indifference that irks his fellows to no end . 

searching for a way to get information on the government , osnard sets his sights on harry pendel ( geoffrey rush ) , an unctuous tailor serving the panamanian elite . 

harry claims to be a transplant from britain's renowned saville row , but osnard knows his secret : the tailor is an ex-con who served five years in prison after torching his uncle's shop in an insurance scam . 

he also knows that harry is up to his ears in debt , having spent a fortune on an unsuccessful farm . 

osnard offers harry a way out . 

he will pay for information harry has gathered from his upscale clientele . 

eager to comply , harry offers what he knows , then starts concocting tidbits to keep the money flowing . 

before long , he is forced to spy on his loving wife , louisa ( jamie lee curtis ) , an aide to the canal director . 

harry's little lies build , eventually taking on a life of their own . 

osnard turns in reports about the "" silent opposition , "" a group threatening to upset the balance of control over the canal . 

the bogus revelation proves explosive , leading to meetings in washington d . c . over how to best protect the vital waterway . 

meanwhile , osnard wallows in his newfound status , enjoying the best the city has to offer and wooing an attractive co-worker . 

and harry grows ever more fretful , fearing the consequences if his clients , not to mention his wife , learn about his lies . 

geoffrey rush is wonderful as harry , fawning over his customers by day and savoring his rich family life in the evenings , all while playing secret agent in the off hours with his new benefactor . 

rush makes harry a credible figure , presenting the various levels of the character so effectively that he remains sympathetic despite his duplicity . 

after gaining fame playing larger than life characters , rush flips everything around for this role , using his energy to depict the quiet desperation of a man slowly realizing that the solution to his troubles may be worse than the original problems . 

although she gets far too little screen time , jamie lee curtis imbues louisa with a depth greater than the screenplay provides her . 

of the central characters , she is the only one that exhibits maturity and genuine self-confidence . 

curtis is one of my favorite female actors ; whiplash smart , sultry and charismatic , she deserves more than supporting roles . 

speaking of supporting characters , there are some great ones here . 

harold pinter is amusing as harry's uncle benny , who pops up throughout the story in a number of creative ways . 

also shoring up the proceedings is jon polito as a corrupt banker and dylan baker , who is a riot as a united states general straight out of the dr . strangelove school of armed patriotism . 

but the most important secondary performers are leonor varela and brendan gleeson , both outstanding as two wounded activists . 

their presence adds weight to the story , reminding us that beyond the charades of the leading men , there are real people that have suffered greatly over the politics connected to the canal . 

director john boorman adds additional verisimilitude by shooting the film on location . 

instead of using panama city merely as a colorful backdrop , he adroitly weaves in footage of all aspects of life there . 

the metropolis , described by one character as "" casablanca without heroes "" pulsates with life , underling the folly of the two foreigners playing dangerous games that could have a disastrous impact on a great many people . 

 "" the tailor of panama "" succeeds because the principals behind it were bright enough to make it more than a simple entertainment . 
"
"on seeing the outrageous previews for bulworth one wonders what plot could possibly allow beatty get away with making those statements ( in case you missed it , warren beatty plays a politician on the campaign trail . 

he says to a black congregation "" . . . if you can't cut down on malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind someone other than a running back who stabs his wife , you're never gonna get rid of me . "" ) 

well , there is such a plot , and it works very well in this comedy . 

beatty plays jay billington bulworth , a long-time democratic senator from california . 

the movie opens on a painfully repetitious montage of bulworth's latest commercials condemning affirmative action . 

the montage is ironically intercut with pictures of martin luther king and bulworth in his youth working with jack kennedy . 

when we finally lay eyes on bulworth he is morosely weeping in front of his tv , having gone without food or sleep for days . 

his campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his depression has sunk in too far for him to care . 

first he calls a lobbyist from the insurance industry to get a bribe - a $10 million life insurance policy in his daughter's name . 

then he calls an associate to arrange for his own assassination . 

his assistant murphy ( oliver platt ) is oblivious to bulworth's suicidal state and drags him to his speaking engagements . 

bulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an african-american church , then takes questions from the audience . 

he is hit hard with questions about his voting record . 

he had promised money to help rebuild the community after the riots , and it hasn't shown up . 

since he's a dead man anyway , he figures he'll answer truthfully : he and bill clinton and newt gingrich came to l . a . for the photo opportunity . 

they made some promises that improved their public image for a while , and then counted on the media and the public to eventually forget about the promises they made . 

the shock and outrage from the congregation grows , the questions keep coming , and he keeps shooting back honest , if ugly , answers . 

 ( before i go further , i'd like to make a distinction that the denver post failed to make , and that is that characterizing african-americans as malt-liquor drinking o . j . 

fans is not part of bulworth's "" truth . "" 

that line is in the trailers but it should not be praised like the other political confessions he makes in the movie . 

when the critics praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics , this line is not what they're talking about . ) 

the experience is liberating . 

with nothing left to lose , bulworth is no longer restricted to burping generic platitudes out of both sides of his mouth . 

he can say whatever he wants because he's going to be dead anyway . 

why not tell the people the truth about being a sleazy politician - that he is bought and paid for by lobbyists , and that racism among the populace protects politicians from being the target of charges of classism ? 

bulworth's candor wins him three volunteers from the church , one of whom , nikki ( halle barry ) , he gets a crush on . 

he feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something . 

chicken wings , appropriately enough . 

bulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives . 

when one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings , bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed entertainment . 

with so much money and so many talented people working so hard , he wonders , why can't hollywood make a quality product . 

 ( you go , warren ! ) 

when they become indignant and ask why he's talking to them if he has such a low opinion of their product , he callously admits that it's because they are rich jews . 

that night he drops the three african-american volunteers at their nightclub , and he decides to go in with them . 

he stays up all night drinking , smoking pot , dancing , falling in love with nikki , and learning to scratch turntables and rap . 

the next day , he shuns his prepared speech and instead raps to the suit-and-tie fundraisers . 

from then on , at all of his political appearances , he raps his political truth . 

his rap is not bad for a middle-aged white guy . 

he's not very good , but it is his first try and at least he's not embarrassingly bad . 

his lobbyists are not amused , but the rest of his constituency seems to like the new bulworth . 

eventually , the movie's plot ( remember he hired a hit man ? ) 

overtakes the politics , which is too bad . 

screen time is spent with bulworth trying to cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems to be closing in on him . 

there are even a few gratuitous chase scenes , bulworth fleeing his killer . 

these scenes may have been necessary to keep the events of the film moving along , but it distracted and detracted from bulworth's political ranting , which was much more interesting than the ever-present , obvious-looking assassin . 

still , most of the movie is original and very enjoyable , and beatty deserves most of credit for bringing it to the screen . 

as the story and screen writer , he came up first with a good structure , then with good dialogue to back it up ( jeremy pikser co-wrote the screenplay ) . 

as an actor , he was able to convincingly portray bulworth's depression , then liberation and rebirth . 

as a producer ( there were four others ) he was able to keep the movie free from hollywood's indulgent formulas ( except for those inexcusable chase scenes ) . 

someone else probably could have directed , but since he was there anyway , what the heck . 

it's too bad that there aren't more movies like this around - movies that tackle political corruption in a way that challenges viewers to pay more attention to real politics . 

after all , much of the inspiration for bulworth is straight out of the news . 

just a little perception and insight and you could write your own bulworth rants . 

just don't expect to be popular with the insurance companies . 
"
"terrence malick made an excellent 90 minute film adaptation of james jones' world war ii novel . 

unfortunately , he buried it within an overlong and overreaching 3-hour long pseudo-epic . 

this is a shame because the film features an outstanding performance by nick nolte . 

the best scene is when nick nolte's character , lt . col . tall , is forced to deal with the direct refusal by capt . staros ( elias koteas ) to execute an order . 

nolte's reaction and transformation may be the best work of his career . 

had terrence malick concentrated on the great performances of nolte and koteas as well as those by sean penn , woody harrelson , and john cusack , he could have made a truly great film . 

instead , malick saddled the film with plodding pacing , unnecessary flashbacks , and a voice-over narration all designed to telegraph the great philosophical underpinnings of the story . 

the narration was especially annoying as much of it sounded like very bad high school poetry . 

with a lot of editing , the core story could be transformed into a truly classic war film . 

hopefully , the dvd version of this film will feature options to suppress the narration , and perhaps will even provide for an alternate , shorter version of the film . 

i give this film .

"my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love . 

i love ralph fiennes . 

i love uma thurman . 

i love sean connery . 

hell , i'm even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw . 

i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago , and i've been eagerly awaiting the film ever since . 

a few months into the summer , however , i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times , and that it had ended up in the mid-august dumping ground . 

then , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics . 

and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs . 

and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique . 

my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things . 

the film i saw today didn't even meet those expectations . 

this is a lousy , incoherent mess . 

i would slam it harder , if it weren't for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine , lovable actors . 

but sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired . 

that's the main problem with the avengers : for all it's hip-hop flash and tidal waves , none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired . 

it's like a chore , a bland exercise in superhero film making . 

it also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots . 

this is just plain depressing . 

the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show . 

frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i've never watched an episode . 

i wasn't alive then . 

i don't even watch television now . 

i'm very sorry that i don't have this perspective , but , judging from the reviews i've already read , knowing the tv show just makes matters worse . 

i didn't know and love john steed and emma peel , and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles . 

i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film . 

based on what the film told me , i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , and that dr . peel ( thurman ) is just a really smart doctor , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits . 

they are to work together , under mother's orders ( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent , while his co-conspirator , father , is played by the equally-talented fiona shaw ) . 

it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather . 

his name is de wynter ( connery ) . 

he is a crazy scottish guy . 

our heroes had better stop him , or else . 

 . 

 . 

the weather will keep getting colder until they "" have to go to hell to warm up "" ( one of the film's few funny lines ) . 

along the way there is subplot after subplot , hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere , feel perfunctory , and ultimately make no sense . 

for example , our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos . 

now , killer bugs don't really go with the weather-controlling theme of the film . 

the purpose of the bugs , other than to annihilate our heroes , is never established . 

they're never even directly connected to de wynter ( they're controlled by his crazy henchman , played by eddie izzard ) . 

the special effects aren't bad , but they're loud , obnoxious , and intrusive . 

like so many scenes in the film , it seems present only to keep your attention from waning . 

and i guarantee you , it will wane . 

i stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn't do any good to think . 

the avengers has clearly been chopped up and re-assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn't tell us what happens . 

there are several scenes in the preview that didn't make the final cut . 

in addition , many of the sequences have irritating , grainy film quality , which makes it feel low-budget ( the last scene is particularly bad ) . 

the scenes that don't feature action should be electric , thanks to our wonderful cast . 

they aren't . 

the action scenes should be electric , because this is an action film . 

they aren't , either . 

and what about this wasted cast ? 

oh , it makes me weep with disappointment . 

we're talking ralph fiennes here , one of the best actors working today , one of the best actors * ever * . 

i love the guy . 

i've loved all his films , until this one . 

he seems like he wants to understand the film , but he's as lost as we are . 

and thurman , in all of her spectacular beauty and talent , can't manage to look at home here . 

 ( i don't blame her completely , for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way , and it can't be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting . ) 

connery , however , seems the most out of it , totally lacking any kind of focus , or interest , for that matter . 

who is to blame ? 

is it the screenwriter , don macpherson ? 

perhaps , although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right . 

is it the actors ? 

for god's sake , no -- these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling . 

i blame director jeremiah chechik , who shouldn't have been given the task to begin with . 

his best film , benny & joon , is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be , but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor . 

add to that a lack of experience in big-budget action , and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory . 

if the avengers has a saving grace , it's the set design . 

the sets ( by stuart craig ) are big , colorful , and often pleasing to look at . 

i like the final set-piece , on de wynter's island , even if none of it makes a bit of sense . 

i admired the overhead view of the stairs , showing dr . peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere . 

i also enjoyed michael kamen's music score , particularly in the opening credits . 

but this stuff is routine -- good sets and music are nice , but there's a lot more that needs to be here . 

inspiration , for instance , would have been really nice . 

maybe a little bit of cohesion in the story . 

or a sense of purpose . 

most of all , though , i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles . 

damn this movie for not giving them the chance . 
"
"nearly every film tim burton has directed has been an homage to the horror genre -- "" frankenweenie , "" "" beetlejuice , "" "" batman , "" "" edward scissorhands , "" "" ed wood , "" "" mars attacks ! "" 

-- yet none of them have been horror films . 

 "" sleepy hollow "" is his first attempt to actually scare people . 

i greeted the prospect with high anticipation ; burton's whole career seemed to be leading up to this . 

i left disappointed . 

andrew kevin walker's screenplay takes only the character names from the classic short story "" the legend of sleepy hollow . "" 

in the movie ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is a new york city police constable who is trying to introduce scientific methods of investigation to his superiors . 

ichabod is dispatched to the small town of sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders . 

several of the town's leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman . 

although he rejects the ghost story the town elders tell him , ichabod finds that the facts of the case confound his scientific reasoning . 

he also discovers that the killings are not random , that the victims are tied together by a secret . 

along the way ichabod gets help from a bewitching ( literally ) young woman ( christina ricci ) and the son of one of the murder victims ( marc pickering ) . 

my reaction : ho-hum . 

the plot is an accumulation of cliches without even the slightest touch of originality to make it interesting . 

that in itself is forgivable ; hollywood constantly tries to sell us used products in new packages . 

however , burton's attempts at inducing fright come off as goofy . 

it might be his background -- in his previous movies , goofy was the goal . 

along the same lines , it doesn't help that creature designer ( and producer ) kevin yagher has done his best work for the tongue-in-cheek tales from the crypt tv series . 

a witch's eyes and tongue shoot out like roger rabbit's , a tree spurts blood like it's in a monty python sketch , and the headless horseman . 

 . 

 . 

well , he's a guy without a head . 

 . 

 . 

on a horse ( boo ! ) . 

the performances are also awful . 

although he's impressed me with his work in other films , depp doesn't seem to know what to do with ichabod , and his dialogue is hampered by stilted diction that's supposed to pass for an 18th century accent . 

ricci seems to put all her effort into seeming enigmatic , which guarantees that we won't sympathize with her character . 

the actor who is revealed at the end to be the villain comes off as ridiculously cartoonish . 

the only pleasure generated by the cast comes from surprise cameos by christopher lee , martin landau , and christopher walken . 

i wonder if this movie was originally conceived as part of francis ford coppola's projected series of gothic adaptations , a series that produced only "" bram stoker's dracula "" and "" mary shelley's frankenstein . "" 

coppola is an executive producer for "" sleepy hollow , "" and the script reflects his interest in early forms of "" moving pictures , "" particularly in a toy that ichabod carries which blends two pictures to create an optical illusion . 

 ( there's a bird on one side of the card , a cage on the other . 

when the card is flipped rapidly , the bird appears to be caged . ) 

bottom line : the hollow isn't the only thing that's sleepy . 
"
"these days , people have rather short attention span and hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run . 

1970s nostalgia is already wearing off , and now , people are becoming more and more interested in 1980s . 

few years in the future , early 1990s are going to be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia . 

however , i doubt that people are going to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period . 

one of the reason would surely be films like national lampoon's loaded weapon 1 , that , in many ways , symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry - lack of originality and ideas . 

being made as some kind of parody on lethal weapon series , this film pairs two l . a . policemen - jack colt ( emilio estevez ) , burn-out alcoholic cop on the edge , and wes luger ( samuel l . jackson ) , by-the-book policeman , days away from retirement . 

two of them , following the murder of luger's ex- partner , must confront evil general mortars ( william shatner ) , crime lord who is going to flood the market with cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies . 

the authors of this films ( whose director , gene quintano , worked on such projects like third and fourth sequel of police academy ) lacked any original idea before they undertook the projects , and that reflects in the lack plot , characters , and , even original lines . 

the plot , or what goes for the plot in this movie , is nothing more than a series of gags that make laugh of some popular films made in previous few years ( apart from lethal weapon series , this film "" borrows "" its female lead from basic instinct ) . 

the best gags , are , same as with many other similar movies , shown in the trailers . 

the rest simply doesn't work . 

only those who used to watch a lot of hollywood products in that period would laugh . 

others would probably wince at the lameness of humour . 

some would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once in a while . 

but , at the end , spending hour and half in front of this disorganised mess of a movie is simply not worth the effort . 

the film was sometimes criticised for being the parody of a series that already had strong comic overtones . 

the authors of lethal weapon returned the favour by using the loaded weapon 1 joke in their fourth sequel . 
"
" "" very bad things , "" is the most delightfully morbid film of the year , a movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and violence that i couldn't help but be won over by the material . 

the film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in los angeles for a bachelor party in las vegas . 

the groom-to-be is kyle fisher ( jon favreau ) , who is about to be married to the controlling , wedding-obsessed laura ( cameron diaz ) . 

the other friends are real estate agent robert boyd ( christian slater ) , quiet charles ( leland orser ) , and brothers , michael ( jeremy piven ) and family man adam ( daniel stern ) . 

after a wild night of gambling , boozing , and drugs , a stripper ( carla scott ) who was paid for by robert comes into their hotel room , but after a freak accident , to everyone's terror , she is killed . 

as robert puts it : "" there are two options : go to the police and go to prison , or bury her out in the desert where no one will ever find her . "" 

after a security guard enters into the hotel room unexpectantly and sees the body , robert is forced to kill him as well . 

 "" okay , there is only one option now . 

you can forget about calling the police , "" he says . 

by the time the five friends return home and as the wedding draws nearer , most of them are overcome with guilt , which sets off an even more elaborate series of event , that includes much , much more murder , double-crosses , and the inevitable wedding from hell . 

 "" very bad things , "" which is actor peter berg's feature film directing debut , is the shockingly perverse and wicked comedy that , "" there's something about mary , "" wanted to be . 

it pulls out all the stops to create something fresh , original , and hilarious , even if that requires surprisingly graphic violence , gore , and a slew of truly hateful characters that all get what they deserve by the end . 

the screenplay , also written by berg , is , to put it mildly , very funny and courageous . 

during the second act of the film , some of the fun was beginning to slightly dwindle due to so much death , which was beginning to undermine the humor , but it eventually recouped itself with a climax that has to be seen to be believed . 

the dialogue is edgy and inventive , and this film proves that a movie doesn't necessarily require likable character to be extremely enjoyable . 

there's more fun , i think , in showing ignorable people getting their just desserts . 

cameron diaz gives her best performance to date here , and has a lot of fun in playing the hateful laura , who eventually turns out to be more crazy than any of the five male friends . 

diaz puts so much overblown energy to her character that i really do think she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination come next january . 

by the time she is beating someone to death with a coat hanger , and reciting lines like , "" stuff him in the crapper and get your ass upstairs , "" i couldn't help but crack up at how "" balls-to-the-wall "" this film had become . 

jeanne tripplehorn creates another character original , as daniel stern's wife , who late in the picture , we discover , is a tough kick-boxer that should not be messed around with . 

it is at this level that , "" very bad things , "" was so entertaining and surprising . 

just when you thought you could predict what was going to happen , there would be a little twist involving the characters that would be absolutely wacky . 

the last sequence was perfect and managed to go even further over-the-top . 

although i enjoyed the film immensely , let me make this clear : "" very bad things , "" is not a movie for everyone . 

it is more tasteless than anything i have ever seen , it is more violent and bloody than a r-rated film usually is , and it is offensive . 

luckily , these are elements that i would prefer in a comedy , since it clearly shows the filmmakers were set on making a no-holds-barred , politically incorrect comedy . 

the fact that this film slipped through the cracks of the usually mainstream and "" safe "" wide-releases coming out lately , still gives me hope for the hollywood film industry . 
"
" "" last night "" could have an "" aka "" tagged on the end of it that says , "" it's the end of the world , and we feel fine "" . 

 "" last night "" is about just that . 

the last night of planet earth's existence . 

the world is going to end at precisely midnight , january 1st , 2000 . 

how scientists were so accurately able to predict when this catastrophic event would occur is never explained . 

nor is the event itself . 

throughout the entire movie , no explanation is given as to why this is happening . 

in doing this , mckellar ( who also wrote and directed the film ) seems to be trying to transcend the genre . 

he's attempted to make a film about people , and how each of them deals with their last night of life . 

the film contains no science fiction elements , which allows the viewer to concentrate on the feelings and actions of the characters . 

mckellar is largely successful in his attempt to rise above his material . 

the film is set in toronto , and follows several people in their various escapades on the last night of existence . 

there's mckellar , who plays a man who just wants to be alone when the moment occurs , but keeps getting interrupted by a woman ( sandra oh ) in search of her husband . 

her husband , played by david cronenberg , is spending the day working at the gas company , informing people that they will attempt to keep providing gas right up until the end . 

finally , there's mckellar's friend , played by callum keith rennie , a man who has spent his final months trying out every sexual perversion you can think of . 

mckellar has crafted a gang of the some of the most interesting characters i've seen in a film in months . 

these people all felt real to me , especially the character played by sandra oh . 

we can see her desperation , her utter need to be with her husband in the final hours . 

rennie is good , too , as the man who wants to literally try everything before he dies . 

he exudes such charm and likeablity , it's not surprising that we're rooting for him to get what he wants . 

but for me , the biggest surprise in the movie is mckellar . 

i knew that he was a talented director , but i had no idea he could act as well . 

his insistence to be alone , much to the dismay of his parents , is something that most people would find difficult to understand , but as played by mckellar , we can understand his reasons . 

he doesn't buy into the whole notion that just because everyone's going to die , he should immediately find some companionship . 

he realizes the relationship would be forced , and they would only be together for the sake of being together . 

mckellar gives a brilliant performance , and i hope he alternates between directing and acting . 

my only quibble with the film is that we never find out why the world is ending . 

i really wanted to know , and my need to know was hanging over the film at all times . 

i appreciate the fact that mckellar didn't want the material to rule the film , and that he wanted the movie to be more of a study in human behavious . 

however , in not telling the audience what the cause of earth's destruction is , he's left a big question that is in their minds throughout the film . 

another problem is we never see anybody panicking . 

i would imagine if the world was ending , and there was nothing to be done about it , a large segment of the population would be going out of their minds . 

instead , we are treated to shots of a giant crowd partying like it's new year's eve . 

i just didn't buy the fact that everyone had completely accepted their fate . 

no one had the urge to "" rage against the dying of the light "" . 

despite these small problems , "" last night "" is one of the best movies of the year . 

as opposed to the moronic "" armageddon "" , "" last night "" treats the subject at hand with maturity and believabilty . 

and bruce willis never shows up to save the day . 
"
"unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi , an artist whose palette is fabric . 

ostensibly , the film is a documentary , but use of that term requires stretching its meaning . 

many scenes appear staged , and a great deal of cutting-and-pasting has been done in the editing room . 

the cinema verite effect is a conceit -- genuine spontaneity is at a premium , and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera ( especially would-be actresses like cindy crawford ) . 

director douglas keeve ( who was mizrahi's lover at the time ) freely admits that he "" couldn't care less about the truth "" but was more interested in capturing "" the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion . "" 

despite violating nearly every rule of "" legitimate "" documentary film making , however , unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment . 

while it sheds only a little light on the behind-the-scenes world of the fashion industry , it presents a fascinating , if incomplete , picture of designer mizrahi . 

this man is the perfect subject for this kind of study -- he's funny , energetic , and eminently quotable . 

he has unusual views on just about everything , from fashion ( "" it's about women not wanting to look like cows "" ) to mary tyler moore ( "" between her and jackie kennedy , they shaped this country "" ) to style ( "" it's almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs "" ) . 

unzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress . 

it's almost certainly different that anyone would imagine . 

the designer draws on a variety of sources for his look , including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies , then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection . 

in particular , unzipped traces mizrahi's development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show , which highlights a number of prominent models , including cindy crawford , naomi campbell , kate bush , and linda evangelista . 

on the technical side , a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped . 

a variety of film stocks were used : super 8 , 16 mm black-and-white , and 35 mm color . 

there is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness -- the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie , and , during the climactic fashion show , color is used to show the audience's perspective , while black-and-white is for the behind-the- scenes sequences . 

nevertheless , some viewers will be put off by this treatment . 

while unzipped isn't an expose on the fashion industry per se , keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear . 

overall , however , this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else , and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed . 

when the designer declares that "" everything is frustrating except designing clothes -- that's beautiful and liberating , "" it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed .

"i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night , but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies . 

luckily , my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta ! 

i knew it was going to be a bad print with only half-faces and poor sound quality , but i couldn't help myself . . . 

i got it . 

well , after watching it ( it indeed was a bad print ) i was glad i didn't dish out $7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie . 

this movie really sucks . 

it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy ! ! 

for example , how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days ? 

jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail . 

the songs are bad , the acting is bad ( especially deepti bhatnagar's ) , and the direction is the worst of all . 

the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up . 

i didn't even finish the movie . . . 

i couldn't take it anymore . 

note : but if anyone out there liked aatish ( by the same director ) , i guess you'd like this movie . 

it's practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff . 

aditya panscholi is the sidekick again . 

 ( i was going to give it a zero , but i personally like jackie shroff , so i loosened up a little . 

he looked fresh , wore good clothes ( as always ) , and his performance , even though it wasn't his best , was the only saving grace of the movie )

"leonardo decaprio ( what's eating gilbert grape ) and claire danes ( tv's my so called life ) star in director baz luhrmann's modernized version of william shakespeare's classic , romeo & juliet . 

surrounded by a superb supporting cast , in-cluding paul sorvino ( goodfellas ) , brian dennehy ( tommy boy ) , pete poslethwaite ( the usual sus-pects ) and john leguizamo ( executive decision ) , decaprio and danes shine throughout the film . 

the story starts off at a gas station , where the "" montague boys "" meet the "" capulet boys "" and square off with one another . 

symbolizing the swords of shakespeare's day were their weapons , like the "" rapier-9mm "" or the "" longsword- shotgun . "" 

instead of killing each other right away , they shoot around , just like in sword fights of old . 

another great thing about the film was the performance of harold perrineau as romeo's best friend . 

mercutio , who in shakespeare's novel was quite a stud , was portrayed as an afri-can-american cross-dresser whose violent na-ture , was a definite plus . 

miriam margoyles , a virtually unknown actress was astounding as juliet's nurse , even though she was never given a name . 

she was the only one who could keep juliet out of her fantasy world . 

verona was the home of the rival families in shakespeare's version , only slightly changed in luhrmann's . 

now known as verona beach , the capulet's ( led by sorvino ) and montague's ( led by dennehy ) are now rival corporate dynasties . 

and their small family skirmishes were now huge gang wars . 

one slight problem with the film was the difficulty to comprehend the dialogue , since it was spoken in old english . 

sub-titles could have helped in the beginning of the movie , but toward the end , it became easier to understand . 

this excellent movie poses another prob-lem : what genre is it ? 

romeo & juliet contains so much drama , yet enough comedy and action to be placed in either of those categories . 

with the same award-winning formula that was used by quentin tarantino in reservoir dogs and pulp fiction , romeo & juliet is a sure fire modern masterpiece .

"richard gere is not one of my favorite actors . 

however , i like courtroom dramas , and this film looked good enough to take a chance on . 

i wasn't disappointed . 

it wasn't a great film , but it was interesting , and took several unexpected turns . 

one thing : what's with the title ? 

not only is it extremely forgettable , it doesn't really have much to do with the film , as far as i could determine . 

in the long run , it will probably hurt the film , as people won't be able to think of or remember it . 

martin vail ( richard gere ) is a grandiose defense attorney . 

he loves the money and the fame that go along with defending ( successfully ) rich scum , such as mafia men and drug-dealers . 

once he sees that the accused killer of a prominent chicago archbishop is a baby-faced alter boy , he wants in on the case , presumably for the press he'll get . 

we soon find out that the prosecutor assigned is a former lover , janet venable ( laura linney ) . 

vail himself is a former prosecutor , and quit because of tensions between himself and the district attorney , played very well by john mahoney ( frasier's father on the tv series ) . 

there is an underlying theme of dichotomy in the movie : people have public faces , and private faces . 

we see this in the murdered archbishop , in the accused , and , most strongly , defense attorney martin vail . 

richard gere does a fairly good job . 

at first , he appears to be a money- and attention-grabbing lawyer , with no consideration of the truth . 

but we see another side , as he becomes a seeker of justice , and comes to believe in his client . 

alfre woodard , as the judge , is capable , though somewhat wasted in a standard role . 

laura linney also does journeyman work ; nothing spectacular , but acceptable . 

her relationship with vail is believable ; their verbal fencing adds to the film . 

the actor who playes vail's investigator ( unfortunately , i don't remember his name ) is quite good . 

his female assistant ( she looked very familiar , but i can't remember where i've seen her ) was also capable , but unspectacular . 

the best performance in the film was by edward norton . 

he was excellent , as the timid altar-boy turned alleged "" butcher boy of st . mike's "" . 

i was impressed by the depth of the plot ; there are red-herrings , and dead-ends , that in a lesser film would lead to a predictable ending . 

i liked the plot twists the film took , and most of the supporting characters , thus i give primal fear a respectable b+ rating .

"please don't mind this windbag letting off a bit of steam . . . i 

just want to warn all of y'all not to waste your hard-earned $$$ on anaconda . 

it's not even worth a 99-cent video rental . 

don't listen to ebert on this one ( he has no clue what he's talking about ! ) 

btw i accompanied my friend to this one because she was * required * to watch it on assignment ( she reviews movies for a local paper ) . 

now i'll actually back up my huffing and puffing . 

here goes : 

movie : anaconda rydain's bottom line : wait for it to come on usa up all night . 

even then , i doubt it's worth the price of jolt ( to help you stay up that late ! ) 

why do i hate anaconda ? 

let me count the ways . . . 

first of all , this movie gets way too many snake facts wrong . 

as an ophiophile ( snake lover ) , i can tell you that a ) anacondas would never reach a length of 40 feet , b ) they're scared of people , c ) cases of snakes eating adult humans are extremely rare because human shoulders are too wide to fit in a snake's mouth , and constrictor snakes don't kill what they can't eat , d ) people can outrun snakes with no trouble , especially heavy ones like anacondas , e ) if an anaconda did eat a human , it would need at least 6 months of sitting on its butt to digest the huge meal , therefore it couldn't run around gobbling up everybody else in the cast , and f ) snakes have no vocal cords , so they can't make funny squealing noises . 

whew . 

i was prepared to suspend reality if the movie would have been worth it . 

unfortunately , anaconda was about as suspenseful and exciting as watching paint peel . 

my friend and i even successfully predicted who would live at the end . 

anybody can tell the bad guy is going to die eventually . 

that was a pity because his character was one of the few reasons my friend and i didn't give up and fall asleep . 

he was the most likable character in the movie . 

who wouldn't enjoy somebody who looks like a deranged walt whitman ? 

anaconda did have its cute moments : arguments between ice cube's character and the british guy , for instance . 

however , those small flashes of wit were not worth the other hour and twenty-eight minutes of boring schlock . 

the writers had - and blew - a multitude of opportunities to insert funny lines . 

i was quite disappointed with a scene where a young guy tells a young lady that the jungle makes him horny . 

did she retort with a clever , ego-withering comeback ? 

of course not ! 

 "" i'm trying to work ! "" 

gee , that's even dumber than the crap comebacks i come up with . 

she could have told him to go find a knothole or something . . . 

 ; p but i will admit , there was just one scene where i was surprised at the outcome ( hint : it involves the evil guy and miss crap comebacks ) . 

as for the plot , i'm still trying to find one . 

this movie was basically an excuse to get a boatload of people into dangerous territory where they could get snarfed by ridiculous , computer-generated anacondas with the eyes and fangs of vipers and the faster-than-gravity downward acceleration of a harrier jet . 

 ( harrier snake ? ) 

not to mention instant digestion so they could go snarf countless other victims . 

the writers tried to throw in some sort of plot twist ( should i call it a plot knot because it made no sense ? ) in which the sick guy's g-friend kisses the evil dude and suddenly everybody hates said evil dude and starts trying to kill him . 

that was about as clear and understandable as mission : impossible . 

 ( if someone could explain that movie to me , i'd be most grateful ! 

all the old-guy double agents looked the same ! ! ) 

i wasn't inspired by the acting , save for the evil dude . 

i can't blame the actors , though . 

it's not their fault they had a cruddy script to work with . 

this concludes rydain's diatribe on a shameless exploitation ( and perpetuation ! ) of public fear of snakes . 

comments , flames , anyone ?

"did you ever wonder if dennis rodman was actually from this planet ? 

or if sylvester stallone was some kind of weird extra-terrestrial ? 

i used to think that about my 7th grade english teacher , ms . carey . 

but after seeing this movie , they may have confirmed my suspicions . 

as the story goes , at any time , there are over a thousand aliens living among us here on earth . 

the men in black ( mib ) are the watchdogs that oversee the cosmic citizens , guardians of our beloved planet from nasty-tempered aliens , and secret service to the stars . 

based in new york city ( where weird is the norm ) , the mib organization gives human form to our space-faring emigrants so that they may walk and live among us unnoticed . 

but to enforce the laws of earth , the mib carry weapons that are powerful enough to meet or exceed destruction quotas in one single blast . 

they carry other-worldly technology to erase people's short-term memory when common folk see the mib in action . 

and their best leads on cosmic things-gone-awry are the supermarket tabloids . 

little do we know that there are much stronger battles of good v . evil going on in the depths of space . 

one of the aliens-as-human on this planet is an important diplomat that is carrying something very precious . 

it holds the 'key' , literally , to universal peace . 

a giant cockroach-like alien soon arrives on the planet and steals this 'key' . 

in the wrong alien hands ( flippers ? 

mandibles ? 

tentacles ? ) , it can be used as a weapon . 

therefore , it must be recovered and returned to it's rightful owners . 

otherwise , to ensure universal safety , earth will be destroyed , along with the 'key' . 

now , it's the mib who must prevent this catastrophe . 

the mib agents on the case are "" k "" , played by tommy lee jones . 

he is crustier than burnt toast and even more serious than al gore . 

the stars in the sky no longer spark wonder in his eyes . 

he is accompanied by a flippant rookie , "" j "" , played by will smith . 

but , despite this shoot-em-up , protect-earth-from-destruction premise , this is nothing at all like a typical summer action movie . 

and , this isn't an independence day knockoff . 

rather , this is a stylishly offbeat sci-fi comedy that pokes fun at what the government always denies ? that there are real aliens that live here , and that the government does its darndest to cover them up . 

but to give it some sense of excitement and to keep it within the parameters of the summer movie recipe , there must be some kind of earth-hangs-in-the-balance scenario . 

yet , this movie is very appealing . 

the abundance of wierdness ( talking aliens , pee-wee atomizers , a mortician who 'lives' for her work , and lots of yucky bugs and slime-splattering galore ) , is played straight , like as if this were normal ( of course , we are in nyc ) . 

it gives it a deadpan feel , which makes it all the more funnier and odder . 

jones plays the venerable seen-it-all agent with seriousness and maturity . 

smith is likeable and makes a great comic partner to jones' straight man routine . 

they click like dorothy's ruby red shoes . 

the look and feel of the movie is made even better with direction from barry sonnenfeld ( the addam's family ) . 

this guy has a knack for 'gothic' comedy , and successfully transfers his macabre sense of humor onto the screen . 

and , an appropriate dose of special effects helps to bolster the oddness of their task without diverting attention from the human actors . 

the story moves well , and before you know it , the end credits are already rolling ! 

the result is 100 minutes worth of fun in the form of ewwwws and blechhhs , aaaahhhs and wows . 

let the men in black protect and color your world .

"if he doesn=92t watch out , mel gibson is in danger of being known as someone other than mad max . 

of course there are still a few big guns in this film , but there=92s some accomplished acting too . 

although gibson continues to shed his rough and gritty anti-hero skin as his career progresses , here he explores a new genre : the businessman as action hero . 

in ron howard=92s latest film , gibson plays tom mullen , a gazillionaire airline owner whose son is snatched from the junior science fair by kidnappers . 

mullen at first agrees to pay the ransom , but when things fall apart he rethinks the situation . 

a veteran of numerous hard-nosed business negotiations , the tycoon realizes that in order to get his son back alive , he has to play his hand differently . 

the casting is what puts this film over the top . 

the trio of gibson , the kidnappers' mastermind ( gary sinise ) and fbi team leader ( delroy lindo ) play off of each other wonderfully . 

sinise is perfect as the driven scheming sleezebag is right on the mark . 

his speech to mullen over a walkie talkie about h . g . wells=92 morlocks and eloi reveal his vision of= 

society . mullen and the other glitteratti frolic up on high while sinise and the other lowlifes dwell below , feeding off the unsuspecting . 

gibson=92s character is an all-american hero with a few flaws . 

his cowboy= 

tactics tend to work , but they are also what got him into this situation to begin with . 

in a round about way , if he weren=92t known as a man who i= s willing to buy his way out of trouble , his son wouldn=92t have been kidnapped . 

as sinise says "" you=92re a payer . 

you did it once and now you=92re going to do it again . "" 

one of the nicest elements of this film is that most of the characters actually have personalities . 

lindo calls home to talk to his kids , obviously shaken at working this case . 

even the kidnappers are real people , arguing about the ultimate fate of sean mullen and feeding him candy bars . 

gibson=92s break-down on the balcony of their penthouse apartment is especially effective . 

it=92s one of the best filmed representations of a man=92s world falling apart that i=92ve seen . 

it=92s not all perfect . 

the shoot 'em upending , while emotionally satisfying seems tacked on to be just that rather than to provide a powerful resolution . 

as well crafted as the scene is , we=92ve seen it before . 

mullen=92s wife ( rene russo ) has several good moments , but occasionally just seems to be there . 

while adequate , brawley nolte ( sean ) doesn=92t provide much to the film other than occupying space to build the story around . 

but you=92ll ignore these problems as each minute of the movie builds on the previous one . 

forget about the large coke , you won=92t want to leave for that five minute break an hour later . 
"
"alexander dumas' the three musketeers is one of the most often-adapted literary works , and for good reason : the swashbuckler is a legend rather than just a story . 

perhaps the musketeer , a new film that "" reimagines "" the novel in the spirit and style of the matrix , is one adaptation too many . 

it's just awful : spiritless , silly and unforgivably boring , transforming the timeless classic into a mish-mash of old-as-time clich ? s and incoherent , repetitive action sequences . 

this time , d'artagnan is played by calvin klein model justin chambers , who can't even pronounce his character's name . 

as a boy , he watched his father get killed by febre ( tim roth ) , a lackey of power-hungry cardinal richelieu . 

he vowed to have vengeance . 

after undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman , he goes looking for his enemy . 

on his quest , he embroils himself in a struggle for control at the highest levels of the french government . 

the royal musketeers have lost their gusto , what with their jobs being taken over by the cardinal's own guards . 

only a few loyal swashbuckers remain , among them athos and portos ( who are only figureheads in this movie ) . 

together with d'artagnan , they fight to extricate the queen ( catherine deneuve ) from the traps that febre and richelieu are trying to plant . 

oh , and as an afterthought , d'artagnan falls in love with the poor maid at the local inn ( mena suvari ) . 

just thought i'd mention that . 

now , look : i don't know whose idea this was , but whoever is responsible deserves a severe tongue-lashing . 

i have nothing against "" modernizing "" classic works of literature - at the very least , they can inspire viewers to actually read the book - but films as dull as this have no positive side effects . 

director peter hyams , known for such masterpieces of modern cinema as timecop and end of days , has jettisoned everything that was great about dumas' masterwork : the sense of excitement , cause , and camaraderie . 

instead , we get impressively choreographed but somehow vacuous , uninvolving action sequences that emerge from emptiness and lead to nothing . 

when the musketeers finally get to holler "" all for one , and one for all , "" i could have sworn that was dumas rolling in his grave that i felt . 

maybe the reason for the utter lack of suspense here is the hyams's tone , which is unreasonably dark and brooding when you consider the reader's digest condensed version of the story that he gives us . 

it's as though anything that may have been construed as "" fun "" was purposely expunged from the production . 

the joylessness of the proceedings , from the oppressively shady lighting to the mechanical fight scenes , can be felt in every frame . 

chambers can't act ; suvari , roth and deneuve can , but aren't given the chance . 

and when push comes to shove , the use of stunt doubles is distractingly obvious , though at least roth gets to play a villain without having to wear an ape suit . 

some movies seem sloppy and careless , clearly made for a quick buck . 

with the musketeer we get the sense that it was meticulously crafted to be awful . 

the film is intricate , stylish and precise , hitting the wrong note every single time .

"starship troopers is a bad movie . 

i mean , a really , really , bad movie . 

not only does it cross the line of bad taste when it comes to blood , gore and body parts shown on the screen , it blissfully jumps over that line , apparently unaware that the movie trailers appeal to an audience of five to fifteen year olds ( of which i saw many in the theatre ) . 

looking past the appalling sight of overdone violence , we are left with a movie with a thin plot at best , no strong lead characters , a blatant disregard for physics , and a very obvious naziesque theme . 

that being said , onto the review : the movie starts with a propaganda message from the federation ( who's logo bears a * strong * resemblance to a nazi german eagle ) , urging the populace to go off and fight the bugs , who are attempting to destroy earth . 

the film shows large rallies with young children in attendance , pledging allegiance to the federation ( again , sound familiar ? ) . 

as the movie progresses , we are shown terror tactic training , as a drill sargeant very graphically compound fractures one recruits arm , and throws a knife through another's hand . 

eventually , the recruits embark on a journey to a location two thirds of the way across the milky way galaxy , to fight the bugs on their home planet . 

as our faster than light travelling "" heroes "" arrive on planet , they drop onto the planet , and burst our of their craft brandishing . . . 

 "" what ? "" 

you say , "" laser beam weapons ? 

sonic weapons ? 

phasers ? 

photon cannons ? "" . 

nope , they hop out brandishing good old 1997 machine guns , pump action rifles , and tactical nuclear weapons ! 

i guess a lot of physics money r&d went into travel and not weaponry . 

as the assault begins , our group of troopers are seen walking in a straight line through a box canyon . 

two members of the group notice rocks slipping and falling above them , and one even sees a streak fly by , but disregards it as nothing . 

this of course , leads to more massive carnage , blood shed , and graphic depictions of limbs and heads being ripped and severed from their bodies . 

again , i see that military tactics in the future must have evolved at about the same pace as their weapons ! 

in the end , we see neil patrick "" doogie howser "" harris burst onto the scene in what could accurately be described as a nazi ss trenchcoat , hat , and gloves . 

he does a vulcan mind meld on the giant slug , and then proclaims that the bugs are scared ! 

this sets the troopers into a frenzy , as they are now one step closer to completing their goal , total genocide of a species ( again , sound familiar ? ? ) . 

i have tried very hard not to step on and spoil the plot with this review , but given it's non-existence , i may have anyway . 

i could go on for pages ripping this movie apart , but don't want to bore you too badly . 

in short , i felt as if i were subjected to a mix between a pro-nazi war film with bugs substituted for allies , a drivers education accident scene film , and a complete blank screen ( the plot , of course ) . 

i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone , anywhere , under any circumstance .

"plot : a peculiar french girl grows up lonely with her father and doesn't quite know what she wants out of life . 

one day , she falls upon something , and believes that her ticket to happiness may be in helping others . 

she starts with the people around her , but when she suddenly falls for her own guy , she can't act strongly enough because of her shy and dreamy nature . 

critique : a clever , quirky , original french flick set in a picturesque paris , featuring an endearing lead with a giant imagination , much loneliness and a little bit of love for everyone . 

this is a "" feel-good "" kind of movie , a fairy tale for grown-ups who are bummed out about life . 

it doesn't pretend to be deep , it doesn't weigh itself down with long expositions or intricate studies of its characters , it's basically just a "" cute movie "" in the same vein as chocolat and pay it forward , with some amazing visuals and incredibly nice intentions ( and if chocolat was somehow able to nab an oscar nomination for best picture last year ( a sham on so many different levels ) , you might as well slap this film up for consideration also , since it's quite a bit better and much more original than the former ) . 

one thing that this film isn't though , at least according to me , is the best film of the year ( it was bestowed the honor of "" best "" in at least 3 different film festivals so far this year ) . 

it actually managed to stagnate a little bit about halfway through and it just went on for way too long ( it's a little over two hours but it felt even longer ) , with much of the second half of the movie devoted to many different characters , all of whom weren't as interesting as the lead , and a lot of indecisiveness from ms . amelie herself , which got frustrating . 

thankfully , this film doesn't bog itself down with too much of that stuff , and actually goes out of its way to invent new ways to shoot scenes , to integrate moments of fantasy into its fabric and to transport the audience inside the imagination of this kind-hearted french girl . 

on the whole , it's a lot of fun and it carries a beautiful message of love and support for your fellow man . 

the lead , audrey tautou , is perfect for the role , and gives you enough moments of truth to develop her character into someone that you care about by the end of the film . 

unfortunately , the rest of the cast isn't as well-developed , and even though most of them are pretty appealing , a couple could've been left out to save time and at least one was left stranded plot-wise , by the film's end ( what happened to the guy in the caf ? who was spying on his ex-girlfriend the whole movie ? ) . 

now i haven't seen too many recent french films , i will admit , but if this is the kind of "" scene "" that they're developing over in "" le pays du vin "" , i wouldn't mind catching more of their flicks in the future ( crimson rivers was another french film that i saw earlier this year , which i really liked- ironically , that film was directed by mathieu kassovitz , who is the co-star in this film ) . 

granted , the english subtitles got a little tough to keep up with at times ( i speak and understand french also , but some of the local colloquialisms went over my head ) , especially since the film's visuals were so intriguing that you just couldn't help but constantly gawk at them , but the general idea , the background music , the nifty french neighborhoods , the very creative way of enveloping the audience into the story-line from the start , were all very easy to appreciate , and i for one was especially glad to have seen this movie during these trying times in the world . 

in fact , i'd recommend it to anyone looking for a jolly ol' time at the movie house , with a particular emphasis on folks with a lot of imagination , a little loneliness in their lives and many dreams in their hearts . 

and this guy directed alien : resurrection ? 

get outta here ! ! 

note : i especially loved the way that the script detailed and showed the loves/hates of everyone with exact mentions in the film . 

it was very original , very well shot and very nostalgic , as many of us were able to relate to the behaviors described . 

good stuff !

"plot : a human space astronaut accidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes . 

he is taken prisoner along with some other humans , and tries his best to escape his simian captors . 

oh yeah , and did i mention that the apes can talk ? 

kewl ! 

critique : despite this film not looking like a "" tim burton movie "" or its lead human character showing any signs of being a human being himself , i did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun , summer fare . 

although the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape make-up jobs and characterizations . 

i mean , i was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real ! 

i also have to "" give it up "" to all of the actors inside the costumes , not only for waking up at three in the morning every day to get make-up slobbered all over them for 2-4 hours , but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well . 

i especially enjoyed bonham carter's performance , who i believed to be the most developed character in the entire film ( human or ape ) and tim roth's bad guy , who chewed up scenery and oozed evil in every scene in which he took part . 

plot-wise , i liked the beginning of the film , the whole build-up once wahlberg got into the village , the escape and most of the fight scenes , but once things got out into the deserted area ( and the final battle sequence ) , i kinda lost a bit of my interest . 

i was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of "" human beings as animals "" then i was about the end battle sequence , which just seemed a bit too typical for this kind of film . 

i also hated the "" kid "" character who just got on my nerves and didn't really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved ( i won't ruin it here but c'mon guys . . . you 

coulda thought of something a little more plausible than that , no ? ) . 

but the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead character , his cold demeanor and the zero chemistry that he shared with either one of his inter-species love interests . 

this dude didn't seem to give a rat's ass about anyone but himself and i ultimately didn't really care about what happened to him either . 

now i'm not sure if this was the fault of the actor or the script , but the film suffered because of it . 

visually , the movie was also nice to look at ( especially the apes ! ) , but i definitely expected greater coolness from tim burton . 

the "" surprise ending "" that highlighted the original planet of the apes film back in 1968 , felt a little tacked on here , and despite being interesting , didn't really make all that much sense to me ( unless you look at it from a sequel point of view ) . 

so overall , i loved the whole "" feel "" of the planet , the apes that ruled it , the manner in which they treated the humans , screamed , shouted and reverted the entire evolution chain , but didn't appreciate the film's lack of human character development ( why was kris kristofferson even in this movie ? ) and the fact that its lead male and female humans were just plain boring . 

but i would still recommend this film as a fun , summer movie with laughs , creepiness and a really cool premise . 

ps : for anyone who has seen the original , i cannot believe that they didn't at least bring back the scene in which the lead human character ( in this case , mark wahlberg ) goes nuts at the world in which he's suddenly been thrust ( "" this is a mad house ! "" - 

type of thing ) . 

the guy in this film barely seems to be "" put off "" by the fact that he's surrounded by apes who can speak english ! !

"you've probably heard the one about the priest and the rabbi , but never with the same dosage of featherweight charm that is sprinkled over `keeping the faith' . 

it's a fluffy comedy , thoroughly glazed with a sense of innocuous innocence and good cheer , regarding two moral topics -- love and religion -- and how a romantic triangle causes the two to collide head-on . 

as youngsters , brian finn , jacob schramm and anna reilly were an inseparable trio . 

while their friendship progressed , anna always had the compassion to shower them both with the same love and support , so neither would feel excluded . 

but tragedy soon struck , as anna was forced to move away . 

now adults , brian ( edward norton ) and jacob ( ben stiller ) hold similar but contrastive jobs . 

the likable and kind-hearted father brian is a catholic priest , while the spry and outgoing jacob acts as a jewish rabbi . 

on the basketball court , they refer to themselves as `the god squad' . 

in the relationship field , brian abides by his catholic principle of celibacy , but jacob has reached the point where finding a jewish bride is practically mandatory . 

everything changes when anna ( jenna elfman ) returns to new york to visit her childhood chums . 

now a workaholic , she devotes endless hours per week to her business , but does find spare time to reminisce with brian and jacob - both ecstatic about seeing their elementary school sweetheart once again . 

with these oddball ingredients tossed into one cocktail , there's bound to be some awkward romance between our three central characters . 

predicting the outcome is not entirely difficult , but `keeping the faith' is open , entertaining and refreshingly relaxed as it travels en route from point a to point b . 

edward norton has emerged as one of the finest , most flexibly versatile actors in hollywood - a success story sparked by his critically lauded debut in the 1996 thriller `primal fear' . 

after shockingly bitter roles in `american history x' and , most recently , david fincher's vicious `fight club' , a quaint romantic comedy might seem like a peculiar choice . 

not in the least . 

norton slips into the director's chair for the first time with `keeping the faith' , and here his incisive , resourceful approach helps add additional craft to a surprisingly perceptive screenplay by stuart blumberg . 

weighing every aspect , it is unanimously an impressive directorial debut . 

in addition , norton pushes all the right buttons with the sheepish sweetheart brian , generating a thoroughly likable screen presence . 

stiller ( the zipper guy from `there's something about mary' ) is firm and funny , boasting a fully-ripened comic maturity . 

elfman's perky repetition can grow tiresome ( such is occasionally the case on tv's `dharma and greg' ) , but she seems perfectly rambunctious here . 

the remaining cast members offer fine support , from anne bancroft as jacob's animated jewish mom to milos forman as an elderly priest quick to contribute intelligent advice . 

`keeping the faith' is the perfect date flick . . . 

though perfection is not a word to associate with the film in general . 

there is turbulence during the process of lift-off , as numerous failed attempts at establishing the situation cloud the projected comedy ahead . 

once the film does settle in , it is often funny and always cheerful . 

stiller , norton and elfman have created three enormously lovable personalities . 

we enjoy their interaction , understand their various dilemmas and feel humbled to realize everything rings perfectly true . 

this is excluding the ending , which is acceptable and all , but seems to lack the charm and spontaneity of the preceding romantic entanglements . 

nonetheless , a narrowly mishandled finale certainly won't wipe the smile off your face , nor anyone else's in the audience . 

`keeping the faith' is a highly enjoyable romantic comedy , although one that is more observant while surveying the questions of love rather than religion . 

aww , what the hell . 

the quality is not quite heaven-sent , but this little charmer could revive our `faith' in a potentially tired filmmaking genre .

"can you say "" dated "" ? 

you can if you've seen rosemary's baby which , like the exorcist , was a thrilling horror film in its time but seems boring and laughable in the decades that have passed since its original release . 

 "" mystery science theater 3000 "" has skewered the bad films of the past , but let me tell you , it could do a number on the "" good "" ones too . 

rosemary's baby stars mia farrow ( from the time she was actually good-looking ) as an innocent housewife and her not-so-innocent husband ( john cassavettes ) , an actor who takes an easy , albeit evil , road to success . 

it all seems so harmless in the beginning . 

mia and john move into an apartment where several past murders have been committed . 

 ( there's also a skull in the living room , but it's only for decoration . ) 

their elderly neighbors pop in for a housewarming . 

all's well for about the first hour of this slow-moving film , until mia eats some of the neighbors' chocolate mousse and passes out . 

when she comes to , she finds herself in a darkened room with a bunch of people yelling and dancing like savages and a big , evil man raping her -- a foreshadowing of her future life with woody allen . 

it seems like a dream and , when she finds herself pregnant , she almost forgets about it . 

and everyone's helping with the pregnancy . 

the neighbors have some wonderful vitamin potions for her to drink , a good-luck charm for her to wear around her neck , and the name of an obstetrician who's been in the business 66 . 6 

years . 

meanwhile , mia begins having chronic stomach pains and losing a lot of weight . 

before too long she looks just like the lead singer of the cranberries . 

that's when you know your health's failing . 

the only person in the movie who's the least bit suspicious of all this is an old friend ( maurice evans ) who calls mia up to give her the bad news -- and immediately falls into a coma . 

by about the two-hour mark i felt the same way . 

rosemary's baby is way too long , and leads up to a payoff that's about as boring and laughable as the rest of the movie . 

i guess someone put a spell on this movie . 
"
"virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre . 

since 'dark city' ( 1998 ) , films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another . 

the most popular and original of them all has been the matrix . 

all the films released after it , have been less successful . 

david cronenberg's existenz , released only a couple of months after the matrix , was accepted and even appreciated ( by some ) , but the hype was gone . 

and when 'the thirteenth floor' aired this fall , it was completely overseen and ignored . 

i admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying , feeling like eating the same meal over and over again . 

it was therefore i was less than excited , when i went out to see to 'the thirteenth floor' . 

however , i was positively surprised by josef rusnak's latest picture . 

matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality , combining the best of hollywood's action and effects with an intelligent story . 

existenz was a violent , gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality , ending in blood and madness . 

'the thirteenth floor' is somewhere in between . 

instead of going after the crowds - the action audience ( like the matrix ) , or aiming at the horror fans ( like existenz ) , 'the thirteenth floor' presents a more intelligent plot , witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience , that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding . 

in a near future . . . on 

the thirteenth floor of a classified building , a genius scientist , hannon fuller , has created a simulated world , his personal dreamworld , where every inhabitant is a complex , selflearning program that only believes it is real . 

right after the first testing of this world , fuller ( ) is found murdered . 

douglas hall ( ) , his closest friend and business partner , immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth . 

a beautiful woman ( gretchen mol ) who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery , which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence . 

the first "" download into simulation "" is impressive . 

it is the creator's first visit to his world , his creation . 

in order to enter this virtual universe , you have to take over someone's identity , become another person . 

this is called conciseness transfer , and this is part of the tragedy in the film : people "" wake up "" in unknown places and strange things start happen . 

they start to doubt in their own sanity . 

these innocent people pay for the mistakes of their "" users "" and creators with their sanity and their lives . 

it is a frightening reality ; the fact that all the people in the simulation ( the program links ) are living out their lives , oblivious , not knowing that they are puppets in someone's fantasy . 

with an appealing ( "" blade runner "" - type ) of detective story , this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present . 

our modern world is metal and glass -- cold , unfriendly , impersonal . 

the thirties are different -- colorful , beautiful , elegant , virile . 

this contrast demonstrates a wish for change . 

virtual reality is here portrayed as a magical , enchanting power that seduces you into its endless possibilities . 

to some it is just a journey to their personal paradise , to some a personal playground -- a life without any consequences . 

for others - a way to start over and "" correct "" their mistakes , by living in an illusion of their past . 

virtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes , dreams and fantasies to life . 

at least that's how it is all beginning . 

but when you're waking up from your dream , the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise . 

this , almost narcotic effect , soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness . 

some important and interesting philosophical questions are raised -- what is real ? 

what is thought ? 

who are we ? 

if these were answered , this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made . 

they are off course not answered , but posed in an intelligent manner . 

the visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements , since it portrays the contrast between these computer-simulated universes . 

kirk m . petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour , grace and color ; and setting this world in opposition to our own -- an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties . 

there are some honest and decent performances by an almost unknown cast and harald klose's moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time . 

a rather unusual thing about'the thirteenth floor' is the almost complete lack of special effects . 

there are no cgi animated creatures , no bullets in slow motion . 

this is a more philosophical approach , reminding about the european way of filmmaking . 

this is off course a major disappointment to the audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians , but the more serious science fiction buffs and 'dark city'-fans will be pleased . 

this film is interesting and inspiring . 

it has everything existenz doesn't , but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix . 

and then there is a happy end which , like in 'dark city' , completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context . 

the plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us to think , since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics , including blade runner and 'dark city' . 

with this in mind , 'the thirteenth floor' doesn't make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now , yet this is a beautiful , elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality .

"the lives of older people in the twilight of their years attempting to come to grips with their shared histories and possible futures is a fascinating topic . 

finding an all-star cast for such a film is a stroke of genius . 

combining all that with a three-time oscar-winning director ( robert benton of "" kramer vs . 

kramer "" ) and creating a decidedly mediocre movie is the stuff of disappointment . 

in yet another noir mystery set in hollywood -- how many of these have we seen during the past few years ? 

-- the atmosphere is moody , the actors enjoyable to watch and the story goes nowhere . 

over-70 harry ross ( paul newman ) is a washed up cop-turned-private eye-turned man friday trying to figure out how to live what remains of his life . 

he's screwed up things pretty well ( "" i had a wife and daughter . 

now , i'm a drunk ) and is at a crossroads . 

a couple of years ago , he traveled to mexico to bring back mel ( reese witherspoon ) , the under-age daughter of jack ( gene hackman ) and catherine ( susan sarandon ) ames and now lives with them . 

the ames are former movie stars , past their prime and the three have become fast friends . 

one gets the impression that ross is just hanging out waiting for something to wake him up . 

to fill his time , he does odd jobs for jack and falls in love with catherine . 

jack is in even worse shape than harry . 

he's dying of cancer with only a year to live . 

things do turn more exciting when jack asks harry to drop off a sealed manila envelope for him . 

instead of the routine errand that ross expects , he walks into a barrage of bullets from the gun of another ex-cop who is , himself , full of bloody holes . 

this unsettling event gives the former detective a project to throw himself into and launches an investigation that revolves around the mysterious disappearance of catherine's first husband 20 years before . 

through a series of very complex and convoluted plot devices that involve murder ; blackmail ; guns ; mel's mexico traveling partner and his parole officer ; ross's former cop buddies , ex-lover and would-be sidekick , the tale finally ends up exactly where everyone expects it to . 

it's a film noir tradition that the story twists and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale , but here the journey meanders towards an ending that no one cares about . 

the only surprises are exactly whose face fits which role in the scenario . 

by the time they show you , it doesn't matter . 

the storyline gets goofier and goofier exemplified in ross's relationship with rubin ( giancarlo esposito ) , a partner wannabe . 

these scenes are obviously designed to be comic relief , however they are neither . 

rubin and ross have some past relationship but either it's not explained or i didn't care enough at that point to remember . 

a running joke about where harry was supposedly shot while in mexico is probably meant to mirror his questions about whether he is still able to perform . 

it's also not funny , doesn't connect and keeps on showing up long after it has run its course . 

on the positive side , it's often enjoyable to watch the seasoned actors on the screen . 

the three leads all have well-deserved academy awards and turn in accomplished , if not extraordinary jobs . 

newman is a grand actor , but doesn't seem quite suited to the dark film style . 

he is a bit too clean and understated to come across as desperate and down and out . 

hackman , also low-key , is believable but lacks sparkle . 

sarandon comes across well as an sultry older babe although she is one-dimensional . 

the actors do what they can with lame dialog , but they can't pull the film out of the hole it's dug for itself . 

james garner who plays ross's old buddy ex-cop raymond hope is always a treat , but even he half-heartedly struggles through lines like "" i'm glad they didn't shoot your pecker off . "" 

the best part of the film is the look at old friends , how their relationships change over the years and the difficult choices they must make . 

the genuinely easy and casual interactions among the actors hint that being on the set was much more interesting than what ended up on the screen 

the film doesn't run very long before the audience realizes that it's hopeless . 

the only reason for watching is the actors . 

it reminds me of disaster movies such as "" towering inferno "" where the star power is supposed to make everyone ignore the film's problems . 

in a better world , there would have been second-rate actors in this second-rate movie and the ones here would have been saved for something better . 

of course , we don't live in that better world , but you could make yours a little nicer by choosing a different movie . 
"
"while screen adaptations of john irving's novels have been disappointingly uneven , the films have all shared one particular strength : key casting . 

who can forget john lithgow as roberta muldoon , the transsexual quarterback of "" the world according to garp , "" or nastassja kinski as susie the bear in "" the hotel new hampshire "" ? 

a lot of good casting decisions have gone into the making of "" the cider house rules , "" an adaptation of irving's poetic 1994 novel about a restless young man called homer wells . 

among those sound judgments was the decision to have the splendid tobey maguire assume the pivotal role ; the decision to cast michael caine as his mentor and father figure , dr . wilbur larch , the ether-addicted head obstetrician of the st . cloud's orphanage , maine ; and the decision to offer jane alexander and kathy baker supporting roles as his head nurses . 

then there are the brethren who populate the apple orchard where homer wells finds himself shortly after leaving st . cloud's , including delroy lindo , oscar ? -worthy as the foreman of the migrant work detail that drifts up and down the coast as the seasons take them . 

there's kate nelligan as the matriarch of the cider house , and charlize theron as candy , the lovely , lonely wife of a wwii bomber pilot ( paul rudd ) sent away on a mission overseas leaving candy to set lobster traps with homer wells , a man who's never seen the ocean before let alone a lobster . 

am i forgetting anyone ? 

yes . 

kieran culkin and paz de la huerta as dissolute orphanage residents who make you sit up and take notice every time they're on the screen . 

but with "" the cider house rules , "" the good people decisions don't end with the cast . 

irving has written his own screenplay in order to get it right this time ( last year's "" simon birch , "" loosely based on his "" a prayer for owen meaney , "" was a big-screen example of irving handled sub-standardly ) ; the author appears fleetingly as a stationmaster here . 

rachel portman , a composer of such sweet and lyrical tenderness , provides a score that's absolutely right for the project--sweet , lyrical , and tender . 

there's impressive new england photography by oliver stapleton too . 

last but by no means least is "" my life as a dog "" director lasse hallstr ? m , who shows enormous skill in pulling this collective together and helping bring irving's marvelously touching story to life . 

for the many beloved who pass away in "" the cider house rules , "" it's an extraordinarily life-affirming story . 

and now , thanks to these talented individuals , it's an extraordinarily life-affirming film .

"the premise of turbulence is i'm sure very familiar to us all . 

we've seen it before in passenger 57 , executive decision , and countless other flicks that are good in there own way . 

you know , terrorists take over a plane , ask the police on the ground for what they what and so on . 

turbulence starts out with a "" convict "" ray liotta being accused of a crime . 

you think there is no way he could have done it , he's so open and kind . 

he is taken in and is subsequently transported on a commerical plane to la . 

this is already a problem . 

there is no way that convicts would be transported on the same commercial flight that normal passangers would be on . 

anyway , it is christmas eve and everyone is waiting to get to la and spend christmas eve there . 

well , convict one manages to stop the flight in its proverbial "" tracks "" and liotta , still as calm as ever , takes the other convict out . 

he also has eyes for lauren holly , a flight attendent , and seems to grow closer to her . 

 "" the plot stops here "" 

i didn't like this movie because it seemed to be a rip off of every other airplane movie i've ever seen . 

at one point , mr . liotta looked exactly like jack nicholson in the shining ( i'm serious ! ) . 

it was like they stole for every other movie down to a "" t "" . 

the only reason i did not give this 0 stars is because it had some okay stunts . 

don't even bother ! 
"
"it's a shame the execution of this concept falls very short of its premise . 

the movie is lacking and most unsatisfying . 

osmosis jones is crude , gross , disgusting , and was directed by the farrelly brothers - the twisted siblings behind there's something about mary , me , myself and irene and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt . 

not that there's anything wrong with scatology . 

i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor - such as it was . 

it's merely that with osmosis jones , the farrellys humor is too juvenile , too predictable . 

you can almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the inner anatomy a sequence is drawn . 

osmosis jones looks like one of those old health class movies gone psycho . 

the trouble is , the animation may please the very young , but the jokes may be over their heads , while the teen-age audience may find it too tame for their tastes . 

adults ? well , let's just say most will find it unappetizing . 

osmosis jones plays like a 100-minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby . 

the live action sequences revolve around frank ( bill murray ) , who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe . 

he continually looks as if he needs a shave and a shower . 

frank , much to the consternation of his daughter , is a fast-food addict , eating anything - and everything - that can kill you . 

he works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner - and presumably smell better - than he does . 

frank's body is invaded by thrax , a lethal virus , after frank eats a hard-boiled egg that had fallen to the ground . 

it's not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt and plops it into his mouth . 

nope , the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg , wresting it from the primate's mouth . 

like i said , the gross meter tips the scales on this one . 

after ingesting the egg , the movie begins its animated sequences . 

here , osmosis jones ( voiced by chris rock ) , a renegade white blood cell is teamed with drix ( voiced by frasier's david hyde pierce ) , a 12-hour , painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax ( smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne ) . 

basically , what we have is a cliched cop-buddy movie , rife with all the clich ? s of that genre . 

and this is why osmosis jones doesn't click . 

it merely falls back on tired , familiar conventions instead of creating new and exciting situations . 

the jokes and puns are lame : osmosis searches out a snitch , a former flu virus . 

after pumping him for information , drix tells osmosis , "" funny , he doesn't look fluish . "" 

and the jokes don't rise above that level . 

the live action scenes are no better . 

frank is such a slob , so unappealing that it is difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired a child . 

he's almost a bigger cartoon than the animated characters . 

osmosis jones is a movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns and dissolves blood cells right and left . 

the animation is rather two-dimensional and flat . 

it lacks scope and depth . 

it is an unappealing movie that will leave you scratching your head , and maybe leaning toward a shower after you walk out of the theater . 
"
"take a look at the following equation . . . . 

a christmas carol+ghostbusters=scrooged 

yes , scrooged is the odd mixture of sentiment , comedy and horror you would get if you mixed those two elements toghether . 

scrooged is alternatively sick , gross , funny , and then sickly soppy . 

bill murray plays frank cross , a t . v executive with a horrible personality . 

he's evil to secretary , actors , crew , everyone , except the t . v's station's boss , of course ( played by the late robert mitchum ) however , he is then visited by a very dead exec , who warns cross that he will be visited by three ghosts , past , present and future ( who is called the ghost of yet to come , for some reason ) sure enough , they arrive , show cross how much of a s . o . b he is , and he changes his way . 

however , throughout this simple plot , we've got to suffer outlandish special effects , poor comedy , and an very , very mean performance from bill murray . 

frank cross isn't 'funny' mean , he's just mean . 

he also isn't very good at emotional scenes , and totally destroys the last ten minutes of the film , with an utterly desperate speech saying how great christmas is , and how he has changed . 

however , the supporting cast are ok , with good performances from mitchum , allen ( who plays his girlfriend ) and john glover ( who plays cross's 'partner' ) the ghost of christmas past isn't that bad either . 

sadly , though , the audience has to suffer 25 minutes of 'home alone' style violence from the ghost of christmas present , played by carol kane . 

whoever thought smacking that kane smacking murray in the head with a toaster was funny , should be fired straight away . 

and the audience also has to suffer bobcat goldthwait ( the guy with the annoying voice in police academy 3 , if i remeber correctly . . . . ) 

who , thankfully , dosen't say much . 

the script is horrendous . 

michael o'donaghue churns out terrible , bad taste jokes ( which i guess is the whole point really ) then changes direction completely to emotional scenes . 

and he must of been on some drug when he wrote the final ten minutes , which are awful . 

the special effects look nice , but do nothing for the film . 

there's some impressive make up effects also . 

the music is also good , which is scored by danny elfman . 

but great effects and make up don't make a great film . 

scrooged is an appaling attempt to inject some christmas spirit into the audience , seeing as the first 1 hour 20 minutes of the film are so depressing anyway , and the last ten minutes had to make up for it with an godawful speech . 

why didn't cross just look out his exec window , and ask a young boy to buy a goose for him ? 

overall , then , you'd have a much better christmas if you avoid this film like something that should be avoided ( perhaps a plague ) 
"
"the long kiss goodnight ( r ) meryl streep tried it and failed . 

even pamela anderson lee made an attempt but fell flat on her well-bared assets . 

however , geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star with the long kiss goodnight , a preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husband , renny harlin . 

davis plays samantha caine , a mousy suburban school teacher and mother whose memories only go back eight years . 

with the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey ( samuel l . jackson ) , she slowly remembers--and reclaims--her past as charly baltimore , tough-as-nails cia operative . 

needless to say , with the reappearance of samantha/charly comes the appearance of an assortment of no-goodniks out to erase more than her memory . 

shane black netted a cool $4 mil for his script ; i'm not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag , but for what it's worth , it delivers the goods . 

like black's previous work , such as lethal weapon and the last boy scout , the script juggles some impressive action scenes with funny , quirky dialogue . 

the humor especially works well in this case , for the story is so preposterous that the laughs help to keep things from taking things too seriously . 

but there's no argument that the more unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell : who can resist the sight of davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car . . . 

while ice skating ? 

jackson and davis make a good team . 

jackson is funny as ever as ever ; in fact , his spirited line deliveries , especially when he first appears , are more than reminiscent of his work as jules in pulp fiction . 

as good as he is , the one who should benefit the most from this project is davis , who shows much promise as an action heroine . 

what makes her so effective and why she should succeed where streep and lee failed is that she doesn't take herself too seriously . 

she is obviously in on the joke , slyly taking jabs at herself and at the situation . 

this is not to say that she doesn't need work--sometimes she lays on the "" toughness "" a bit too thick and comes off too much as a caricature . 

but should the public embrace the film and , in turn , the notion of a kick-ass female , davis could have found her special niche . 

it seems as if davis and harlin's first collaboration , the middling pirate epic cutthroat island , was just a dress rehearsal ( albeit a very costly one ) for long kiss , in which the wife-husband team hit their action stride . 

anyone simply looking for a fun , escapist entertainment that requires little-to-no thinking will find this film to be a more-than-welcome kiss .

"moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post-salary cap era -- you've got to know how to allocate your resources . 

every dollar spent on a free-agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers . 

in the nfl , this leads to teams like the detroit lions , who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract , but can only field five guys named herb to block for him . 

in the movies , you end up with films like "" spawn "" , with a huge special-effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors . 

jackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking . 

he spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line . 

watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid , fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars , is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit , except that sanders doesn't have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages . 

but like the lions star , jackie doesn't have anybody to block for him . 

almost every cent that's invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts , and as chan does his own stunts , the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills . 

this leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors ( chan directs ) , scripts and dubbing and supporting characters , not to mention the hideous title sequence . 

this also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain . 

 ( chan's first release in this country , "" rumble in the bronx "" , was supposedly set in new york , but was filmed in vancouver , and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible . ) 

heck , jackie doesn't even have enough money for a haircut , looks like , much less a personal hairstylist . 

in condor , chan plays the same character he's always played , himself , a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen , a master of both kung-fu and slapstick-fu . 

jackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert , and is chased by a horde of neo-nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs ( one of the things i like about jackie chan movies : no political correctness ) . 

he is joined by three women , who have little to do except scream , "" jackie , save us ! "" , and misuse firearms . 

the villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere , and he's more pathetic than evil . 

en route , we have an extended motorcycle chase scene , a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo-nazis , and two confrontations with savage natives . 

once at the secret desert base , there is a long chop-socky sequence , followed by the film's centerpiece , a wind-tunnel fight that's even better than the one in face/off . 

this is where the money was spent , on well-choreographed kung-fu sequences , on giant kevlar hamster balls , on smashed-up crates of bananas , and on scorpions . 

ignore the gaping holes in the plot ( how , exactly , if the villain's legs were broken , did he escape from the secret nazi base , and why didn't he take the key with him ? ) . 

don't worry about the production values , or what , exactly , the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara . 

just go see the movie . 

operation condor has pretentions of being a "" raiders of the lost ark "" knockoff , but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him -- with a lawrence kazdan screenplay , a john williams score , spielberg directing and george lucas producing , condor might be an a+ movie . 

however , you've got to go with what you've got , and what you've got in jackie chan is something special -- a talent that mainstream hollywood should , could , and ought to utilize .

"as a revolutionary war hero in the patriot , mel gibson provides another macho man performance for hollywood audiences . 

you know the type : his shirt is always shredded , his face always scarred , he has a soft spot for his loved ones and a "" to kill "" list for his enemies . 

oscar-hungry director/executive producer roland emmerich did not intend to , but he made the stereotypical action hero for the 18th century . 

as gibson delivers lines like , "" before this war is over , i am going to kill you , "" schwarzenegger in commando or stallone in cobra immediately come to mind . 

oddly enough , the patriot is as much an epic three-hour-tear-fest like gladiator , as it is a ninety-minute guilty pleasure . 

at times absorbing , at others enjoyably insipid , this is good , bloody summer fun . 

i probably would have despised this film had it not been released over the july 4th weekend . 

some of the images are so zealously americanized ( the flag is used as a lifesaving weapon for example ) , that independence day seems the only appropriate time of year to wholeheartedly accept it . 

like emmerich's id4 , this is obvious propaganda where the americans are the hapless underdogs motivated by freedom for all . 

sure it's predictable and melodramatic , but for a moment after leaving the theater , i was dumbfounded with patriotism . 

and isn't that the point of the patriot ? 

gibson plays benjamin martin , the lionized french and indian war veteran , who , at the beginning of the film , is emotionally suffering after his loving wife passed away . 

he is left to father seven children at his south carolina estate along with black servants ( not slaves ! ) . 

as the revolutionary war rumbles miles away , martin swears to keep his family close and away from the battlefields . 

but when the oldest son enlists anyway and another is murdered by a wicked redcoat colonel ( jason isaacs ) , martin quickly decides to save the day ( or save the fate of america as presented by emmerich ) . 

forming a band of aggressive farmers and using guerilla tactics considered unfair in the art of war , martin becomes the number one target of the british army . 

the best parts of the patriot are the scenes in which martin and his rugged militia men outsmart the british armies left and right . 

every time the farmers attacked the unsuspecting enemy , to see the disbelief on british general cornwallis' ( tom wilkinson ) face was priceless entertainment . 

and as the tension gradually formulates with the running time , a final battle is inevitable . 

as for the numerous battle scenes , they are expertly done . 

clearer and more realistic than those of gladiator , the gruesome images are what give this film an r rating . 

you really get a sense of how warfare was performed during that time period . 

everything is performed in an orderly ( but still quite gory ) fashion - one side shoots , then the other side , then the remaining soldiers charge . 

it's organized , strategic and , according to martin , ineffective . 

there is a very interesting contrast between the traditional battle style and martin's take-no-prisoners method . 

what drives martin to these supposedly unfair actions , are the originally brutal tactics of colonel tavington . 

played wonderfully by jason isaacs , tavington is the type who loves to glare down from his horse at civilians , who nervously avoid eye contact . 

this character is viciously evil ; he kills women and children and then laughs about it on the way home ; even his eyes are evil . 

his portrayal has sparked some controversy in britain , some claim that he falsely represents his countrymen as "" cowardly "" and "" sadistic . "" 

i disagree with this accusation . 

tavington does not represent his country ; his unnecessary executions shock his own colleagues and even anger his general . 

besides tavington , the redcoats remain stick figures that are neither glorified nor patronized . 

and stick figures make the easiest enemies in these kinds of movies - why give the audience a reason to love the bad guys ? 

heck , why not spend the entire film glossing up the good guys ? 

the patriot is three hours of fictional fireworks . 

with an action hero seeking revenge and a comic book villain ready to take him down , it's a lethal weapon for the colonial times . 

god bless america ! 

and god bless the patriot !

" "" footloose "" has only one goal in mind : to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel-good antics . 

and i hate to admit it ; i fell for it . 

the movie is about a teenager ( bacon ) who moves to a small town from the big city , and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend ( lithgow ) . 

he ends up falling for the preacher's daughter ( singer ) and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do . 

as mentioned at the beginning of this review , "" footloose "" is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama . 

there are virtually no surprises , and the writing is second-rate . 

so why did i enjoy it so much ? 

for one thing , the cast is great . 

kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role . 

we're rooting for him right from the start , and , unlike most films of this genre , bacon doesn't play him as the "" rebel without a clue "" sort . 

yes , he does rebel , but he's also polite when he needs to be . 

and he never broods . 

the rest of the cast is equally impressive . 

john lithgow , seen here playing a normal guy for a change , is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian . 

but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter . 

by the end of the film , we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character . 

another nice touch is the music . 

we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with "" sexual innuendos "" , but that's not true at all . 

the title track , performed by kenny loggins , is upbeat and fun . 

during the final sequence , i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing . 

of course , i soon realized that would be a little pathetic . 

anyway , "" footloose "" is a charming little surprise . 

don't let the premise prevent you from watching it . 

it sucked me in , and it'll do the same to you . 
"
"battlefield earth is the worst film of 2000 , and i guarantee you that nothing else this year will even come close . 

in fact , i'll be surprised if i see anything this bad in the next ten years . 

based on the novel by scientology guru l . ron hubbard , battlefield earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information . 

it's the year 3000 , and an alien race called the psychlos ( which sounds like a tag team of mexican wrestlers ) conquered our planet in nine minutes . 

ok , we are all of 10 seconds in and i have a zillion questions racing through my mind . 

when were we conquered ? 

the audience is led to believe that this happened about 1 , 000 years earlier , and if that is the case then we're going to get into a whole bunch of problems later ( trust me . . . 

keep reading ) . 

also , why don't we get to see earth get conquered ? 

how the hell do you make a popcorn sci-fi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film ? 

humans now live as cavemen or slave labor , and for the film's first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver , colorado . 

they grunt and groan and babble about monsters . 

so , when the psychlos conquered earth , were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills ? 

none of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered ( whenever that was ) . 

this is definitely not the way to start an action/sci-fi film . 

one of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster , and he begins to fight it . 

the "" monster "" turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course . 

he turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course , with some shrubs growing over them . 

so , in 1 , 000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time , with only a few weeds growing over it ? 

anyway , some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl ( john travolta ) a smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit . 

the cavemen ( led by barry pepper ) are forced to do their bidding or whatever , but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet , or something . 

so these cavemen are able to do what earth failed to do 1 , 000 years earlier ? 

and , we're supposed to believe that earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group of buffoonish aliens who can't even handle a few cavemen ? 

one of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos . 

so jets left unattended for 1 , 000 years are still able to fly ? 

please , if i leave my car unattended for two weeks i have to replace every fluid and hose under the hood . 

why did the psychlos leave jets around anyway ? 

shouldn't they have destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign against us ? 

the psychlos refer to humans as "" man animals "" but yet dogs are still "" dogs "" . 

why aren't they "" dog animals "" ? 

the psychlos are after mining earth's precious resources , but for 1 , 000 years are unaware of fort knox ? 

why do i even care at this point ? 

i'm a fan of travolta's and i'm glad to see he's back on the a-list in hollywood ( despite the fact that he occasionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael and phenomenon ) . 

but how did he possibly think this was a good movie ? 

and how did he think he was giving a good performance here ? 

he's more than capable of making a menacing villain ( see broken arrow and face/off ) but whenever his character came on screen i couldn't hold back my laughter . 

now despite the different facial features members of this alien race seem to have , travolta just looks like travolta . 

all of the other aliens have weird foreheads or other pointy bones on their face , but travolta just has a goatee . 

also , travolta's acts with a sort of phony upper-class snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world . 

ooooo , scary villain . 

as a producer he should know better and as an actor he should definitely know better . 

you can make a dumb but good sci-fi film ( i love independence day for example ) , but there is absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth . 

i did everything i possibly could to stay awake during the screening . . . 

i cleaned my glasses , walked around the theater , made a grocery list , chose my lottery numbers for the week , replayed super bowl xxv in my head ( with commercials ) . . . 

and still was compelled to scrutinize the insides of my eyelids . 

by the time we actually reach the year 3000 , people should still be avoiding this film . 

folks , save your cash . . 

don't go see it , don't rent it , and don't buy it . 

you'd be more entertained by taking the money you'd use for this movie and just throwing it into the wind , watching it sail away ( hell , send it to us here at the jacksonville film journal . . . 

we'll entertain you plenty with that kind of money ) . 

unless of course you're just captivated by countless slow motion shots of barry pepper running , which is just about all you'll come away with from this movie . 

that , and a headache . 

[editor's note : for some reason though , the day after my screening i converted to scientology . 

i'm not sure why . . . 

something just made me feel compelled make the choice . ] 
"
"well i'll be damned . . . 

the canadians can make a good movie . 

the world is coming to an end . 

we don't know why or how , but apparently there is no way to stop it . 

the world has had this information for months , as most of the rioting and other assorted chaos has passed and governments have shut down operations . 

yet for a handful of toronto citizens , life goes on . 

they aren't going crazy or attacking people in the streets . 

instead they are simply preparing themselves for the end . . . 

some engaging in activities they've always wanted to do , some gathering with family and friends , and others just seeking to be alone . 

these people's lives however all intersect during their final six hours . 

writer-director-star don mckellar has crafted a highly unique and emotional film . 

all of the main characters are compelling as they try and do whatever it is they need to do on their last night on earth . 

craig ( callum keith rennie ) tries to fulfill all his sexual fantasies , a gas company employee ( david cronenberg ) calls every customer letting them know the gas will be flowing until the very end and thanks them for their business , and patrick ( mckellar ) just wants to be by himself but isn't having much success . 

even minor characters keep popping up where you least expect them to , tying everyone even closer . 

things seemed a little hokey towards the beginning of the film , but ultimately everything comes together nicely ( although it's not a happy film . . . 

some moments are understandably gut-wrenching ) . 

the story is enhanced by some unexpected humor and very realistic performances , particularly from sandra oh , whose character is just trying to get home to her husband before the end . 

i have absolutely no problem that the reason for the end of the world is never given , nor does it bother me that the world is ending at exactly 12 midnight ( in toronto anyway ) . 

but i do wonder why the sun never sets . 

come midnight , the sun is still shining brightly . 

maybe the sun is crashing into the earth . . . 

who knows . 

also , it's comforting to know that in mankind's final moments on the planet , people will still gang up on the street for the sheer purpose of pushing over a car or a bus ( that's not a shot at this film mind you . . . 

i know people are just stupid and truly would be out in the street tipping over cars ) . 

last night is available on dvd from universal home video . 

it contains the film in fullscreen format and includes the original theatrical trailer .

"not since oliver stone's natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary , and not since david cronenberg has a so-called mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility . 

while fincher's films have never suffered from a lack of shock value ( his major character killings in both alien 3 and seven are fine examples ) , fight club marks the distillation of his pitch-black comedic sensibility ( see 1997's the game ) into something like a definitive statement . 

jack ( norton , acting as both narrator and protagonist ) is your typical cubicle clone , whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia . 

on the offhand advice of a doctor , he sits in on group-therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer . 

here he meets bob ( marvin lee aday , aka meat loaf ) , a cancer-emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia . 

strangely , the release he finds while sobbing on bob's breasts allows him to sleep at night , at least until a fellow group-therapy "" tourist "" named marla singer ( carter ) comes along to ruin things for him , forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity . 

later , he meets tyler durden ( pitt ) , a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life . 

one night , after his ikea- furnished condo explodes ( don't ask-- you'll just have to see the movie , awright ? ) , he is goaded by tyler into a fight , and damned if it doesn't feel good . 

it is pure , raw existence , a brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison . 

he moves into tyler's squalid abandoned mansion , and they form the titular organization , an underground therapy group where men bond with bare-knuckle savagery and very few rules , the first two of which are "" don't talk about fight club . "" 

armed with charisma and an attractive anti-corporate philosophy , tyler assumes leadership of the burgeoning membership of white-collar slaves and dead-end mcemployees . 

resentment creeps into jack's heart , made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated marla . 

funded by a frivolous lawsuit , tyler begins molding his devotees into an army dedicated to mischief and mayhem . 

their initially juvenile pranks ( like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads ) quickly evolve into something more like sedition , and jack fears that things have gone sour . 

it is after this point , when you are plenty uncomfortable and wondering just how far fincher will go to say something original , that the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist . 

it is so contrived-- and so conventional compared to what precedes it-- that everything which follows ( including the ending ) becomes far less interesting . 

it's a major ( though not fatal ) flaw , and for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher , it feels like a cop-out . 

fight club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people . 

in the early going , it has a downright dangerous feel ; it seems to be saying that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul , and this is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take from it . 

i'll be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs don't spring up here and there , and i'll be even more amazed if fincher isn't vilified for it by the same humorless witch-hunters that are currently after oliver stone . 

they needn't bother , because fight club is less a message movie than fincher's elaborate attempt at a joke . 

tyler durden , for all his dionysian allure , is really nothing more than the logical ( and far less hypocritical ) extrapolation of all those self-help gurus who constantly show up on oprah to preach their me-first gospel of self-actualization . 

in this context , the joke works , but like the latest columbine joke , some people will get it and enjoy a good laugh , and others won't . 

hopefully , though , their silly moral outrage won't spoil the joke for the rest of us .

"hollywood never fails to astound me . 

every time i think those coked-up little buggers have hit rock bottom ; they come up with a new excavating tool . 

i was truly convinced that "" wild wild west "" marked 1999 studio filmmaking at its most hapless , but then along comes "" end of days "" to prove me wrong . 

this big budget , brain dead apocalyptic thriller bludgeons its audience with overwrought music , grisly violence , explosions galore and lots of cheesy special effects . 

the result ? 

nothing but groans and yawns . 

even the devil himself is unable to produce a decent scare in this festival of the inept . 

at the very least , "" end of days "" should have done us the courtesy of being bad-enough-to-be-good , but it can't even manage that . 

it's just lousy . 

arnold schwarzenegger , still recovering from heart problems and "" batman & robin , "" plays an ex-cop turned security agent or bodyguard or something . 

along with his obligatory comic relief partner ( kevin pollak , impersonating matthew perry's chandler character from "" friends "" ) , he gets involved in some major league supernatural hoodoo . 

it seems that satan ( gabriel byrne ) gets a shot at world domination only once every thousand years ( and here i thought he'd pulled it off with the republican landslide of '94 ) . 

if he has sex with 20-year old christine york ( robin tunney ) , "" the chosen one , "" their child will be the antichrist , or at least a brat . 

ah , but this deal has more catches than a new year's eve pass from a halfway house . 

the unholy union must take place on december 31 , 1999 ( you see , 999 is just 666 turned upside down ) , but only between 11 p . m . and midnight ( no wonder this guy is so cranky ) . 

and if the chosen one is given refuge in a church , the devil won't know where she is , because he can't see into the sanctuary . 

you know , it's kind of like superman's x-ray vision and lead walls , only evil . 

a group of guerrilla catholic priests decide the best way to stop the situation is by killing the girl . 

arnold chooses to save the girl and kick the hell out of satan , if you'll pardon the expression . 

and kevin meets up with an exploding van and has to make some decisions of his own . 

oh , the anguish ! 

oh , the humanity ! 

oh , the writing ! 

andrew w . marlowe's screenplay ladles implausibility upon implausibility , from the preposterous otherworldly histrionics to his handling of jericho cane , schwarzenegger's character . 

cane starts the film a la mel gibson in the first "" lethal weapon , "" preparing to put a gun in his mouth due to ongoing despondence over the murder of his wife and daughter . 

twenty minutes later , he's racing through the bowels of new york city , deciphering clues that sherlock holmes and kreskin would find baffling . 

when cane meets up with christine york , he instantly switches to terminator father figure mode , with the young woman serving as surrogate daughter . 

in case anyone misses the connection , the camera comes in for a close up of christine's music box , which just happens to be identical to one owned by cane's daughter . 

subtle , marlowe , subtle . 

speaking of cameras , director peter hyams is just the man to take marlowe's script and make it even more self-important , murky and annoying . 

hyams' direction shows all the subtlety of a gwar video , with cane running a gauntlet of ridiculous action set pieces , punctuated with loads of big explosions . 

eager to satisfy arnold's core audience , he even throws in a few pairs of breasts as well . 

what a guy . 

had the film delivered some decent scares , or even maintained a consistently ominous tone , the bombastic clich ? s might have been tolerable , but "" end of days "" is simply a flaccid special effects show . 

the cast is just as ineffective . 

in his early scenes , gabriel byrne attempts to invest beelzebub with some panache , but he all too soon turns into just another standard issue monster . 

kevin pollak comes and goes quickly , robin tunney comes off like a bargain basement winona ryder and as for arnold , well ? he's a better actor than casper van dien . 

that should count for something . 

way back in the aftermath "" the exorcist "" and "" the omen , "" supernatural swill like "" end of days "" might have passed muster as a b-movie . 

but that was then and this is now . 

 "" the x-files "" and "" buffy the vampire slayer "" deliver real scares on a weekly basis and , if we want to see the devil , all we have to do is flip on "" the 700 club "" and take a gander at pat robertson's grinning maw . 

after enduring "" end of days , "" all i can say is "" get thee behind me , satan . 

and while you're at it , get thee a better agent as well . ""

"warren beatty , diane keaton , goldie hawn and gary shandling star as a pair of married couples whose complacent lives are about to be shaken up in director peter chelsom's version of the classic romantic , screwball comedy in "" town & country . "" 

the drawing room farce of the 30's dealt with sexual innuendo and relied on wit and a great deal of commotion and noise to place the viewer in the thick of the duplicitous romantic action . 

back then , impossibly wealthy scions of society , with too much free time , would get themselves wrapped up in all sorts of sexual peccadilloes with spouses and lovers , only to have everything come out all right in the end - see "" the philadelphia story "" for a great farce . 

 "" town & country "" has the impossibly wealthy protagonists with too much free time - the kind of people that have jobs but never seem to work - and sexual misconduct on several levels . 

but , there is almost no life to original script by michael laughlin and buck henry and this is "" t&c's "" downfall . 

there is , obviously , a great deal of hollywood talent , in front of and behind the camera , involved in "" town & country , "" but , without a likable or , at least , interesting story to carry through their efforts , it is all for naught . 

and , that's what we get here - naught . 

porter stoddard ( beatty ) is a high-powered new york architect with a very good life indeed . 

his 25-year marriage to ellie ( diane keaton ) appears , on the surface , to be perfect . 

but , there are cracks just below this pristine surface . 

his wife is suspicious of his whereabouts , his kids don't need him and his best friends , griffin ( garry shandling ) and mona ( goldie hawn ) , are in the midst of a divorce . 

porter tries to get control of his life before it is too late , but like a man fighting against quicksand , his struggle just sinks him deeper . 

at the 90-minute mark of "" town & country "" i asked myself , "" what's the point ? "" 

i wasn't entertained , i laughed three times - over silly little pratfalls - and spent most of the film marking time 'til the end . 

warren beatty wanders around with his character in a bewildered fog , making problems for himself by thinking with a part of his anatomy other than his head . 

keaton's ellie is an empty headed flake who can't see the obvious as porter screws around on her . 

and , as you get to know them , who would want friends like griffin and mona ? 

the supporting cast is given nothing to do and , sometimes , does harm to the film , given the material they are forced to use . 

nastassja kinski plays a cellist with whom porter has a fling . 

the actress , who has , eerily , failed to age over the years , is miscast as the air-headed musician and the character doesn't belong , anyway . 

jenna elfman is a sweet , but smart , ditz who joins porter and griffin on one of their tacked on misadventures . 

andie macdowell is absolutely painful to watch as a wealthy heiress ( is there any other kind in this movie ? ) 

who comes on to porter . 

the saving grace is a pair of quirky perf's by charlton heston and marian seldes as macdowell's very strange parents . 

glib rationalization of infidelity , like , "" if he doesn't speak english , it doesn't count , "" are a staple for the screenplay . 

the morality of the film seems to be , if you can get away with it , go for it . 

the cast of characters are mostly people you wouldn't want to know , never mind befriend . 

the actors do their best , but are hamstrung by the weak material . 

helmer chelsom , who made the outstanding , offbeat comedy "" funny bones , "" is mired in the mess of a script and never puts his imprint on "" town & country . "" 

the production values are high , as one expects from a big budget hollywood film . 

but , the opulent sets by caroline hanania , lavish wardrobes by molly maginnis and top-notch photography by william fraker cannot save "" town & country . "" 

the film has had a long list of production and distribution problems and it might have been better , for me anyway , if hollywood just said no to this movie . 

i give it a d .

"in the james bond film "" diamonds are forever , "" tiffany case asks 007 whether he prefers brunettes to redheads . 

bond's response is that it doesn't really matter , as long as collars and cuffs match . 

well , collars and cuffs don't match in "" the real blonde . "" 

what might have sounded good on paper ends up as a largely unfunny , meandering comedy on screen . 

the film , supposedly a satire of the superficiality of soap operas and the modeling business , is wafer thin . 

it plays like an "" ally mcbeal "" episode dragged out to the nth degree , replete with a few unnecessary "" fantasy "" sequences . 

writer/director tom dicillo manages the material as if poking fun at daytime dramas is a fresh idea . 

it isn't . 

the only surprise here is that the talented dicillo could make familiar terrain so dreary . 

matthew modine plays joe , a struggling actor waiting tables in order to pay the rent . 

he's 35 with no agent and no credits since he's too proud to take on roles in commercials or soap operas . 

 "" that's not really acting "" he tells his girlfriend of six years , mary ( catherine keener ) , with whom he bickers constantly about sex . 

but they need the money , so joe finally agrees to take a part in a madonna video . 

but it's not really madonna starring in the video but a lookalike ( played by elizabeth berkley , still trying to jump-start her career after "" showgirls "" ) . 

this points out how artificial this whole business is , one supposes . 

dicillo has referred to "" the real blonde "" as "" off-kilter , but an interesting combination of all sorts of stuff . . . "" 

the film , which wanders all over the place without getting anywhere , is remarkably * on * -kilter and , with perhaps the single exception of the always-likable modine ( who's not afraid to stand around in a very unattractive bathing suit surrounded by hunks ) , the entire cast is vague and uninteresting . 

catherine keener , who's appeared in dicillo's previous three films ( including the brilliant "" living in oblivion "" ) , is at her most annoying in "" the real blonde . "" 

look at her closely ; she really can't act at all . 

her reactions are all wrong , almost always out of sync with her co-stars . 

she reacts too soon , or too late , to lines and situations . 

she moves her eyes , or her mouth , far too much . 

she frowns , she yells , she babbles--she blows chunks . 

maxwell caulfield plays joe's actor/waiter buddy bob , the one obsessed with dating a "" natural "" blonde . 

bob's personality ( not to mention caulfield's acting ability ) parallels that of the character he plays on the soap opera "" passion crest "" --stiff and uninteresting . 

maybe that's the point . 

daryl hannah is dim and uninteresting as the real blonde of the title , a soap dish who beds bob both on- and off-camera . 

hannah looks about fifty in this movie ( she's only 37 ) . 

why is that ? 

almost all the women in the film wear tops that show their nipples . 

why is that ! ? 

marlo thomas plays an uninteresting fashion photographer . 

kathleen turner plays an uninteresting talent agent . 

buck henry plays an uninteresting shrink . 

christopher lloyd plays an uninteresting caterer . 

and so on . 

the best parts of the "" the real blonde "" are the beginning and the end , brief scenes of an elderly woman losing and then finding her dog . 

there's more depth and sincerity in a single close-up of her expressive face than in the entire film . 

while this contrast is supposedly meant to highlight the shallowness of the other characters' lives , the only thing that makes shallow and superficial interesting is if it's funny .

"when i left the theater after seeing david lynch's "" lost highway , "" i remarked to a fellow movie-goer , "" i feel like someone just sucked my brains out through my nose and put them back in through my ears . "" 

in his first feature film in five years , lynch delivers a film second only to his debut picture "" eraserhead "" on the weirdness scale . 

you won't "" know "" what happened when it's over , though there are certainly enough clues with which to make some reasonable guesses . 

it is difficult to describe the plot of this film , because it depends partly on how you interpret it . 

i can , however , describe what we see on the screen : l . a . jazz saxophonist fred madison ( bill pullman ) and his wife renee ( patricia arquette ) , whom he clearly suspects of infidelity , receive a series of videotapes apparently filmed inside their house while they were asleep . 

they are , naturally enough , more than a little frightened and confused , and it doesn't help matters any when "" mystery man "" ( robert blake ) approaches fred at a party and proceeds to call himself on the telephone at the madisons' house in a scene that is at once hilarious and unnerving . 

the next morning , fred finds another videotape which , to his ( and our ) surprise , shows him brutally murdering renee in their bedroom . 

he is convicted of her murder and sent to death row , where he inexplicably disappears one night and is replaced by a young mechanic named pete dayton ( balthazar getty ) . 

the perplexed prison officials release dayton , whose life begins to intersect with fred in a number of ways - most notably his affair with alice wakefield ( arquette again ) , a blonde who is otherwise renee's spitting image , and another encounter with the mystery man . 

i would be giving away a little too much to reveal any more , but suffice it to say that lynch doesn't offer any neat wrap ? ups , nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion : the cinematic demons of "" lost highway "" are out in full force from beginning to end . 

this description might make "" lost highway "" sound like a giddy exercise in haywire surrealism , but in fact , while there are traces of lynch's weird sense of humor , this film is anything but giddy most of the time . 

on the contrary , lost highway is a dark and perplexing mystery that takes lynch's previous excursions into murder and intrigue one step farther . 

the film does not revolve around a character investigating a mystery ; rather , the character * is * the mystery . 

there are recurring and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion , distrust , and infidelity thoughout the film that seem to indicate a deluded , fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goings-on here . 

we , the audience , are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this ( probably fred's , in my opinion ) and what , in that case , the other characters and events are meant to represent . 

all of this proceeds , appropriately , in lynch's typically slow-paced , idiosyncratic style . 

as is often the case , lynch relies on sound , imagery , and mood more than on dialogue and action to tell his story , and in "" lost highway "" it works perfectly . 

there are scenes when the camera lingers on fred's blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway , or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains of this mortal coil's "" song to the siren "" can be heard faintly in the background ; nothing is technically "" happening "" in these scenes , yet they present a vivid picture of a man losing his grip just as effective as , if not more so than , the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity . 

lynch's direction and director of photography pete deming's darkly lit cinematography serve to create a nearly suffocating atmosphere of tension and fear that are exactly what is needed for this story . 

well , most of the time , anyway - i have to admit that i was a bit bored at times during the section of the film with pete dayton as the protgaonist , which is less inherently interesting and mostly keeps the viewer's attention because of its tie-ins to the original mystery . 

the main characters in this "" reality "" - dayton ( a well-meaning but none too intelligent 24-year-old ) , a sleazy gangster ( who for some reason has two names but otherwise is pretty much a stock character ) , and his porn-star girlfriend ( the blond arquette ) - are nothing you couldn't find in any of the two dozen "" pulp fiction "" wannabes ; fortunately , the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements , such as the strained , awkward conversations between pete and his parents , help to preserve the film's spooky , unnerving tone during this stretch . 

lynch's typically graphic and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality , while relevant to the themes of jealousy and adultery , are also somewhat overdone here . 

it's not exactly exploitative - like almost everything else in this film , the sex is thoroughly weird and creepy and is unlikely to provide any cheap lurid thrills - as much as it is unnecessary and frankly kind of dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off . 

that said , these minor flaws don't prevent "" lost highway "" from attaining its place as one of the darkest , most unsettling films to hit the screens in recent years . 

it is a one-way ride down the lost highway of a disturbed mind , and as such it is gripping , intense , and brilliantly effective .

"seen february 15 , 1998 on home video ( borrowed from chris wessell ) . 

when it comes to modern gangster movies , it's really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and/or just using the word "" routine . "" 

i've always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea ( no matter how many times it's been used before ) can provide for a good story and "" donnie brasco "" clinches this idea . 

it's not unlike most of the great films of the genre , yet it never apes another's style as it has a good layer of authenticity , even if its core is a tad stale . 

the film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it . 

we meet lefty ( pacino ) , an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk . 

he and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this . 

somehow he comes across donnie brasco ( depp ) , a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isn't afraid of lefty and his rep , and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him . 

it's clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately , telling him all the tricks of the trade . 

i have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit . 

however , we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone , an fbi agent working undercover - a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer . 

the first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor , a brief history of the mob , definitions of their slang , and where their money comes from and who it goes to . 

the screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements , however , the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original . 

most gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works ( probably from watching other gangster movies ) , and although this attitude comes across , the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable . 

thankfully the film doesn't become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime , and instead opts for character development . 

much of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie . 

pacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would . 

he's old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does , just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be . 

we learn of his accomplishments , which are quite impressive within their context , and when he complains about not being made top boss , it's easy to sympathize with him . 

newell constantly plays up this aspect , making it a major theme which works well in the long run . 

as donnie is constantly impressing and even one-upping lefty , it's hard to tell which emotion is more powerful : the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob ; or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed . 

most of the film tells the story of donnie's life in mafia , which creates for many sub-plots and individual conflicts , but doesn't always seem to come together as a whole . 

the storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout , even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar . 

the resonance to donnie's actual assignment varies , he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress , but it doesn't always seem to have much meaning . 

back home , his wife maggie ( heche ) is ready to divorce him because he's never a and the family is suffering . 

since this is based on a true story i wouldn't doubt this would happen , although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic . 

my only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act , or at least any real sense of closure . 

a climax of sorts does occur , but there's little feeling of a payoff . 

we get a happy ending , which is good , but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful . 

aside from a few minor , general flaws , "" donnie brasco "" manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development . 

it may be routine , but it's good , and that's respectful .

reviews independent film and big studio pictures that deserve a second chance on video . 

here is a sample review : 

welcome to sarajevo 

in light of america's recent intervention in kosovo , welcome to sarajevo is a reminder of the horror america and the world ignored for years . 

set in sarajevo 1992 and based on actual events , this picture examines the human and societal casualties of war . 

the picture opens with a family escorting their young bride to her wedding . 

as they make their way down the street , a sniper shoots the mother of the bride . 

yet another reminder that daily life in war torn sarajevo can never escape the horror of war . 

in this scene , we meet joe flynn ( woody harrelson ) , an american reporter who stops reporting to help a priest carry the mortally wounded mother into a church . 

joe is cocky , but also good at heart as he continues to carry out kind deeds for people he doesn't even know . 

his fellow reporter is the british michael henderson ( stephen dillane ) . 

michael is quickly growing tired of the horror that surrounds him and the world's lack of interest . 

henderson is haunted by the memory of an altar boy who witnesses the mother's death as well as a young girl who he finds orphaned in a hospital after a mortar attack on citizens waiting in line for bread . 

he decides to take action when a united nations' delegation descends upon the area to declare yugoslavia the fourteenth most dangerous place on earth . 

henderson begins a series profiling an orphanage located on the front lines . 

he finds children of all ages living in fear and taking care of each other with the help of one adult . 

during his visits , he befriends a pre-teen girl , emira ( emira nuseric ) who serves as surrogate mother to baby roadrunner . 

he promises to get emira out of harm's way if he gets the chance . 

after the un delegation leaves the country without rescuing any of the children , henderson loses hope . 

however , his reporting has grabbed the attention of nina ( marisa tomei ) and her children's aid group that helps to find homes for the yugoslavian orphans . 

unfortunately , only babies are wanted for adoption , so henderson pledges to take emira to england . 

the group of children , nina and henderson depart the front lines on a dangerous escape for italy . 

can they complete this dangerous trek through the war torn countryside and avoid hostile troops gathering up muslims for concentration camps ? 

the movie was beautifully and sensitively made . 

director michael winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce vividly express the societal destruction that has occurred . 

they show the destroyed lives , families that have been split up , and the desolation that everyone attempts to cope with . 

this is best exemplified by the group of yugoslavians henderson , his producer and flynn have befriended . 

the group of twenty-somethings reside in a bombed out bar without life's simplest pleasures and amenities . 

one of them is an accomplished musician who spends his days playing the piano and promising to play a concert when sarajevo is declared the most dangerous place on earth . 

like the rest of those deeply effected by the war , this small group tries to survive instead of trying to live . 

winterbottom brilliantly intersplices scenes with actual news footage to give the film the feel of a documentary and keeps the viewer aware that many of these horrors are being carried out thousands of miles away as you sit safely in your living room . 

the picture is also bolstered by beautiful cinematography that captures the devastation of this city that hosted the 1984 olympics . 

winterbottom and boyce also produce a realistic portrayal of the reporters covering the atrocities . 

this portrayal is much more flattering to reporters than earlier wafflemovies . com 

selection mad city . 

we watch them struggle to cover the horror , while trying to remain professionally detached . 

however , they are human and question the reason behind it all , why no one cares , and how they can get out . 

stephen dillane is wonderful as henderson . 

he portrays the character as an everyman caught in the middle of extraordinary events . 

dillane avoids making the character overly heroic and preachy . 

henderson realizes that he cannot save the world , but he can help a few . 

it is a wonderful opportunity for dillane after he had to suffer through the denis leary-sandra bullock disaster two if by sea . 

woody harrelson continues to prove that he is one of the finest , most versatile actors of his generation . 

harrelson plays the cocky celebrity reporter with a heart of gold by allowing the character's caring nature and vulnerability shine through . 

harrelson is equally adept at taking on roles as zany leading men ( cheers , white men can't jump ) as well as excellent supporting roles such as this one . 

this ability will serve him well and give him a long , successful career . 

america's involvement in this struggle comes seven years after the events of the movie take place . 

for those who do not have a full understanding of the history of the conflict , the entire movie , most importantly the opening scenes , provide a history lesson . 

war is a foreign concept to most of us in america . 

battles are fought thousands of miles away among people we have no attachment to . 

televised images of the gulf war are all the experience most of us have with war . 

this picture brings it right into your living room and makes you think outside of our own small world , something we don't do enough of in 90's america .

"i relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can make me feel like a fool . 

i spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage , grousing to myself about its transparently planes , trains and automobiles plot machinations , and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement . 

this was a mass market romantic comedy , after all , a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and , even in its best days , worked hard to perpetuate the romance = infatuation paradigm . 

then marc lawrence did something wonderful , something which made the entire film click into place : he showed me a comic love story about grown-ups . 

it certainly didn't look that way from the outset , which introduces groom-to-be ben holmes ( ben affleck ) at his bachelor party , surrounded by friends and family whooping over his "" last night of freedom . "" 

ben loves his fiancee bridget ( maura tierney ) , but the doom-and-gloom pronouncements of everyone around him have him questioning the meaning of this 'till death do you part business . 

then , on an ill-fated flight from new york to his wedding in savannah , ben meets sarah lewis ( sandra bullock ) , a free-spirited woman with a string of failed careers and relationships behind her . 

as transportation troubles thwart them at every turn , ben and sarah begin a three-day southward journey in which their connection grows ever stronger , ben seeing in sarah the chances he's never taken and sarah seeing in ben the stability she's never had . 

forces of nature gets off to a solid enough start , setting up the characters and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue . 

ben is an ideal role for affleck's easy-going charm , and he plays the straight-laced straight man without forced exasperation . 

sandra bullock , for her part , is more loose and appealing than she has been in her last half-dozen films combined , avoiding her recent habit of playing any semblance of character depth as moping . 

the two performances -- part of a great top-to-bottom cast -- are effective and connected from the start , yet the script's apparent sympathy with the marital horror stories ben hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completely . 

lively and funny though it may be on a consistent basis , forces of nature leaves a bitter taste that feels like self-justification . 

the kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactly the opposite purpose , leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution . 

forces of nature isn't about a man developing a fear of commitment ; it's about a man learning what commitment means _to him_ , learning that it's not what he thought it was . 

lawrence's script feints and dodges before reaching its happy ending , an ending which is happy because people make the choices that make the most sense . 

earlier scenes that might have felt like throwaways take on more resonance , and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh and genuine . 

though one too many plot contrivances keep ben and sarah together through the film , and they do exchange the obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples , forces of nature wraps up so perfectly that you'll end up remembering the humor and the simple wisdom . 

that is , provided you're not put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes . 

for a brisk romantic comedy , forces of nature comes loaded with some of the most over-directed scenes of the year : teetering hand-held shots , why-not low or high angles , sweeping pans . 

occasionally the hyper-real approach works , with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance ; far more often , hughes refuses to let a scene be what it is , covering it with flourishes so thick you almost can't find what's underneath . 

a script this smart and mature deserved a more restrained director , but even hughes' excesses can't spoil this unique concoction . 

forces of nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something with the power to enchant , something that can make you happy to be proved wrong when you expect a tale for and about adolescents .

"the film may be called mercury rising , but that title doesn't describe the trajectory taken by this motion picture , a routine thriller that combines government cover-ups with a cloying and poorly-motivated buddy story . 

the "" hook "" that is supposed to make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic . 

however , aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his performance , this particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convenient plot device . 

those expecting to see even a semi-thorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed . 

mercury rising treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism . 

the script for mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome and hard- to-swallow . 

i don't know whether the problem is in the original book , simple simon , or in the screenplay adaptation , but this movie easily exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief is no longer possible . 

once again , certain standby plot elements -- the high-level government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent -- are recycled , and not to good effect . 

while bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood , this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense . 

the story begins with a formulaic sequence in which the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold , art jeffries ( bruce willis ) , is confronted with his own failure . 

unable to resolve a hostage crisis in time , he is forced to observe as two teenagers are shot to death . 

the event weighs heavily on his conscience and heavy-handedly establishes his motivation for protecting 9-year old simon lynch ( miko hughes ) when he discovers the autistic child hiding in a closet after his parents have been gunned down by the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player . 

soon , art and simon are on the run from seemingly everyone -- fleeing for their lives and bonding at the same time , with the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player always just a step behind them . 

along the way , they are helped by the best friend who defies orders to help out his buddy ( chi mcbride ) and the supporting female who may or may not become a love interest ( kim dickens ) . 

why is simon in danger and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player ? 

apparently , the government has spent millions of dollars developing an ultra-secret code called "" mercury . "" 

to make sure it can't be cracked , they do the most intuitive thing possible : place a sample of it in a "" nerds' puzzle magazine . "" 

of course , no one can solve it -- no one except autistic simon , that is . 

when he calls the phone number listed in the solution , he gets the nsa . 

as a result , the cold-hearted , sneering government man ( alec baldwin ) decides that simon has to be eliminated -- for the good of the country , of course . 

but he hasn't counted on the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold , even though everyone in the audience has . 

it's hard to get worked up about a routine thriller that doesn't do anything exceptionally well , and does quite a few things rather poorly . 

for those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like , mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from time-to-time , but even the most exciting scenes ( such as the one where art and simon are crouched down , avoiding passing trains ) aren't that pulse-pounding . 

the climactic struggle is a real ho-hum affair which leads to a finale that is painful in its obviousness . 

overall , director harold becker is constantly struggling ( and failing ) to generate even a moment that isn't derivative or obligatory . 

bruce willis' star seems to be fading . 

this is his fourth straight lackluster outing , following last man standing , the fifth element , and the jackal . 

willis isn't terrible , but this is the kind of role he can sleepwalk through , and often does . 

alec baldwin , combining elements of his characters from glengarry glenn ross and malice , does some scenery- chewing , but his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace . 

the film's real star is young miko hughes ( heather langenkamp's son in wes craven's new nightmare ) , who does as good a job as dustin hoffman playing an autistic individual , but is about 50 years younger . 

mercury rising joins the likes of hard rain , the replacement killers , and u . s . marshals on the heap of pallid 1998 thrillers . 

for those who like action and adventure in the theater , this has not been a good year . 

hopefully , the advent of summer will change that . 

until then , the best choices ( for bruce willis or any other action hero ) are on video . 

and , if you're determined to see mercury rising , check out the morning sky in early may .

"michael richards leaves his spot as kramer on the infamous seinfeld tv sitcom for a stint as a lanky , goofy best friend to jeff daniels' lawyer character in this ill-fated , and unfunny , "" comedy "" . 

plot : richard the actor ( richards ) has to take the place of charles the lawyer ( daniels ) in a real court case , after charles is left unintelligible from a night of heavy drinking at his bachelor party . 

the film follows the antics of the two men as they try to get away with their tomfoolery . 

critique : this movie did not make me laugh once . 

perhaps it was because i was tired when i watched it . 

perhaps . 

perhaps it was because i had seen richards perform most of the same schtick a thousand times on seinfeld . 

perhaps . 

perhaps it was because the movie just wasn't funny . 

absolutely . 

the lack of humour wasn't the only issue that i had with this film either . 

the movie attempts to weave a couple of love stories through its vision , but unfortunately , they are also lacking in conviction , believability and credibility . 

they are contrived and appear to be placed into the story for convenience sake . 

the actors were all adequate enough in their roles , but the problem didn't lie in the acting . 

i wish i could find one good reason for you to see this waste of time , but i can't . 

unless of course , you need something playing on your tv set while you waste some time around the house . 

overall , this movie stinks . 

on the good side , charlize theron is darn cute , and the movie is no longer then 90 minutes . 

on the bad side , this movie is not funny , interesting or enjoyable in any which way possible . 

a person wouldn't even enjoy his nachos while watching this emptiness . 

please skip it . 

little known facts : jonathan lynn earned a degree in law from cambridge before becoming an actor/director . 

charlize theron grew up on a farm outside benoni , south africa , as the only child . 

at the age of 18 her mother made her go to los angeles to try a career in the movie industry . 

she came to la without knowing anyone in the city but after two weeks when she was standing in line on hollywood boulevard an agent gave her his card . 

after eight months in la she got her first part . 

since then she has taken acting lessons and her career has skyrocketed , specifically in devil's advocate ( 8/10 ) . 

charlize was narrowly beat out by elizabeth berkley for the lead role in the "" movie "" , showgirls . 

she was quoted as saying "" it was like i had some guardian angel . ""

"natural born killers is really a very simple story that , in essence , has already been told in bonnie & clyde with some major variations in emphasis , mood and degree . 

both films glamorize "" outlaws , "" in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass murderers . 

both relate the story of a couple liberated by love . 

but where bonnie & clyde was partial and subtle , natural born killers is total and blatant . 

where bonnie & clyde was social , natural born killers is psychological . 

what bonnie & clyde hinted at , natural born killers confronts and explores . 

what bonnie and clyde stole , mickey and mallory kill . 

to examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them , expressed metaphorically as killing , subdues the mysterious power this film wields . 

for the most part , when mickey and mallory kill , they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily , they kill what is trying to kill them , they kill what dissembles and cowers from life , they kill what needs to be killed . 

this mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity . 

brahma created . 

vishnu preserved . 

and siva destroyed , but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma . 

the following may be painfully mundane but metaphorically so accurate , i'm forced to say it for clarity's sake : a plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes , that is , destroy the old plumbing system in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics . 

your plumber , bonnie and clyde , mickey and mallory , and siva are all productive destroyers . 

i think you could say without much of a challenge that religion is responsible for more killing and death , presently and historically , than any other phenomena . 

muslims kill christians . 

hindus kill muslims . 

christians kill pagans . 

jews kill christians , etc . you could reverse subject and predicate in each instance and still not be challenged . 

religion is an orgy of killing . 

the institution of the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it hasn't been a major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable . 

 "" the state is the divine idea upon earth , "" hegel said , meaning it is absolute , all-powerful , ineffable , unassailable , infallible , authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh , allah , god , etc . 

well , what does all this have to do with natural born killers ? 

let me first say that religions of this nature , in the ideal , take the place of sex . 

consider the catholic church , which in its hey-dey , took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever . 

god takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope , cardinals , bishops , monks , etc . they forego the one , in order to come closer to the other . 

during the middle ages , when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged , the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power . 

 ( parenthetically , witness plato as well . 

in the republic , he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime . 

not coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself , regularly assailing the passions . ) 

catholicism , as policy , attacks the passions as evil . 

it sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure . 

masturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution . 

this is religion , this is authoritarianism in its essence . 

as further evidence , the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters . 

our culture , most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years . 

we can't help but adopt , even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes , leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self . 

mickey and mallory knox internalized them , too , then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other , discovered them , and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves . 

it is a straightforward liberation through sex . 

as some good patriarch once observed , "" you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on . "" 

m&m had a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions . 

they saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions . 

 "" the moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers , "" as mickey says . 

as a the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter : let us look each other in the face . 

we are hyberboreans--we know well enough how remote our place is . 

 "" neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the hyberboreans "" : even pindar , in his day , knew that much about us . 

beyond the north , beyond ice , beyond death--our life , our happiness . . . . 

we have discovered that happiness ; we know the way ; we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth . 

who else has found it ? --the 

man of today ? -- "" i 

don't know either the way out or the way in ; i am whatever doesn't know either the way out or the way in "" --so sighs the man of today . . . . 

this is the sort of modernity that made us ill--we sickened in lazy peace , cowardly compromise , the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and nay . 

this tolerance and largeur of the heart that "" forgives "" everything because it "" understands "" everything is a sirocco to us . 

rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such south-winds ! 

as far as i can tell , this is what the movie has to say . 

its alleged critique of the media is only secondary , tertiary , quaternary , subsidiary for sure . 

for example wayne gayle's first report ends with some gen x dude saying , "" if i were a mass murderer i'd be mickey and mallory , "" in his most excellent bill and ted voice . 

on one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical , impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes . 

it seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what m&m were up to and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself he'd be just like them , killing and destroying what deserves it . 

let me exemplify what i've been saying by analyzing a scene from the film , namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant , kills him , and then castigates him for giving her "" the worst fuckin' head i've ever had in my life ! ! ! "" 

now , i never claimed that mickey and mallory had a perfect relationship , because demonstrably they didn't , and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us this . 

sometimes they are the source of each others frustrations , but unwilling to kill each other , since they love each other so much and are responsible for each others liberation , they must kill in place of their lever . 

it's no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey . 

as the attendant approached he took on mickey's character in the eyes of mallory . 

she needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory . 

upon discovery , mallory views this as a betrayal , judges him , and commutes his sentence on someone else . 

the style of the movie is a whole 'nother matter that i won't get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power . 

let me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness , barreness and boredom of the frontier lifestyle . 

the rapid succession of all those 8mm , 16mm , 35mm images from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes in sync and sometimes out of sink instills a skittish , frenetic mood . 

also , jungian archetypes abound . 

these can't help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely a few frames . 

some of the best scenes and lines that come to mind . ( quotes are paraphrased only ) : 

mickey to mallory : "" one of these days i'm gonna be cummin' for you , "" in prison , while mallory jacks mickey off . 

semen is a symbol for great potential and things to come . 

at the time they haven't yet had sex nor have they killed anyone yet . 

the two of course go hand in hand . 

for an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs . 

mickey during his marriage to mallory : "" as creator of my universe , i pronounce us man and wife . "" 

the way woody delivers this line is truly haunting , but telling , too . 

it reveals m&m are well on their way to expunging all their destructive tendencies and replacing them with positive ones . 

this is what mickey means by "" creator of my universe , "" he is giving himself or creating for himself healthy attitudes . 

it is not necessarily a schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first appears . 

scagnetti's first meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from the gas station attendant's mouth . 

the indian sage releasing mallory's father , who was reincarnated as a snake : "" old man , go be a snake , "" after telling his "" snake story "" that ends with "" bitch , you knew i was a snake . "" 

after mickey shoots this sage to death during a bewildering nightmare , mallory says , "" you killed life ! ! ! "" 

this is another telling quote because it implies they didn't see themselves as killers of life . 

then what were they killing up to that time ? 

in some case just those zombies faking their way through life , the living dead , as it were . 

in other cases , all the anti-life forces , the cops and their parents . 

the butterfly just before the movie shifts into the prison . 

it of course symbolizes rebirth . 

dr . emil reingold , as portrayed by steven wright , passing judgement on m&m : "" mickey and mallory know the difference between right and wrong , they just don't give a damn . "" 

this is reminiscent of nietzsche's whole philosophy , and maybe a direct reference to his beyond good and evil . 

mickey : "" the rabbit says the moment of realization is worth 1000 prayers . "" 

mickey ( again in his interview ) : "" me and you , we are not the same species . "" 

notice when the escape is in progress we get some role reversals in terms of leadership and control . 

mickey the prisoner becomes the leader of his little gang . 

the wardens become prisoners and the civilians like wayne gayle and his producer follow the leader , no matter who it is . 

mickey : how ya feelin' ? 

wayne : fucking great ! 

mickey : you got the feelin' ? 

wayne : i'm alive . 

i'm alive for the first fuckin' time ! 

what an incredible transformation this is . 

he got the feeling and he couldn't contain himself . 

what a feeling . 

that feeling of metaphysical freedom that you can create your own universe . 

mickey when almost caught in a dead end , "" think , think , think , think . "" 

go figure it out . 

dwight ( tommy lee jones ) in general , because he may be the sickest fuck in the whole film . 

his whole attitude can be summed up with , "" destroy them ! ! ! ""

"any remake of an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project , as a perfect murder illustrates . 

frankly , dial m for murder is not one of the master director's greatest efforts , so there is ample room for improvement . 

unfortunately , instead of updating the script , ironing out some of the faults , and speeding up the pace a little , a perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial m for murder , leaving behind the nearly- unwatchable wreckage of a would-be '90s thriller . 

almost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities . 

the best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in what's going on so that these flaws in logic don't become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled . 

unfortunately , in a perfect murder , the faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as they're happening . 

this is a very bad sign . 

not only do such occurrences shatter any suspension of disbelief , but they have the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder . 

of course , in the case of a perfect murder , at least that gives an audience member something to do besides concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless , cardboard characters . 

a perfect murder isn't a strict remake of dial m for murder , but it does borrow heavily from frederick knott's play ( which was also the source material for hitchcock's version , as well as a 1981 made-for-tv retelling ) . 

emily hayes ( gwyneth paltrow ) is the wealthy wife of powerful wall street mover-and-shaker steven hayes ( michael douglas ) . 

their marriage isn't going well -- emily resents steven's controlling instincts , and , as a form of rebellion , she is having an affair with a penniless painter , david shaw ( viggo mortensen ) . 

when steven learns of the relationship , he decides to confront david , but his approach isn't that of a typical cuckolded husband . 

instead of yelling or threatening , steven offers david a proposal that's too good to resist : for $500 , 000 in cash ( $100 , 000 before , the rest after ) , he is to break into steven's new york apartment and kill emily . 

 ( of course , after getting the first payment , david never bothers to ask how he's supposed to get the rest . ) 

ultimately , i'm not sure which of the three main characters we're supposed to be sympathetic to : the cold-hearted husband , who wants his wife dead so he can get his hands on her fortune ; her mercenary lover , who is willing to do the deed for half-a-million ; or the woman , who is happily carrying on an extramarital affair . 

not only are these individuals all profoundly dislikable , but they're not interesting . 

 ( it's possible to make a good movie with detestable characters -- see reservoir dogs -- but there has to be something compelling about them , which , in this case , there isn't . ) 

steven , emily , and david are all lifted directly from the screenwriting 101 text book on stereotypes . 

the actors in this film are obviously just on hand to get their paychecks . 

michael douglas is playing the kind of heartless tycoon that he can do in his sleep -- he's gordon gekko with an unfaithful wife . 

gwyneth paltrow , who was recently delightful and appealing in sliding doors , is simply awful here . 

she now has the dubious distinction of have starred in two of 1998's worst thrillers ( the other being hush ) . 

at least viggo mortensen ( g . i . 

jane ) has a little fun with his part , but then he usually does interesting things even in bad movies . 

the thin supporting cast includes david suchet , the star of "" poirot , "" as a police inspector , and sarita choudhury ( kama sutra ) as emily's best friend . 

a perfect murder is a plodding production that generates almost no suspense from beginning to end . 

there aren't many twists and turns in the unexpectedly linear script , which makes the ending inevitable almost from the start . 

it's surprising to see director andrew davis , the man behind the fugitive , involved in this mess , but , like his stars , he too needs to earn a living . 

it's just that remaking hitchcock , and doing it so badly , hardly seems to be an honorable way to go about getting the dough . 
"
"every once in a while a movie comes along that completely redefines the genre : with dramas , it was citizen kane , with arthouse it was pulp fiction , and with comedy it was , well , that jim carrey guy ( okay , so he's not a movie , but he did have a huge influence on the genre . 

not to mention an expensive one . ) 

sometimes a movie even combines them all into a big , sprawling motion picture event , as did forrest gump four years ago . 

with action films , it was aliens , whic was released to much hype seven years after it's equally-innovative parent , alien ( 1979 ) . 

directed and written by james cameron ( t2 : judgement day , the abyss , true lies ) , the authority on action films , it was a masterful encore to his sci-fi thriller the terminator ( 1984 ) . 

while the original alien film was a dark , enclosed horror film that featured one alien slowly massacering a horrified crew , james cameron took the big-budget action film with aliens , which featured multiple aliens doing basically the same thing , although on a much-larger scale . 

and boy , did he take that route ! 

i'd say at about 165 mph or so . . . 

the film opens 57 years after the original , with lt . ripley ( weaver ) being found in her ship in a cryogenic state by a salvage vessel . 

if you'll recall , at the end of alien ripley , the only surviving member , cryogenically "" hibernated "" herself after expelling the rogue alien from her ship . 

unfortunately , she thought she'd only be out for a couple of weeks . . . 

once she's returned to earth , ripley is quickly interrogated by "" the company "" , who quickly dismiss her and her stories as lunacy . 

in truth , they believe her , as they soon approach ripley with an offer to travel with some marines to a new colony planet as an "" alien advisor "" . 

it seems that the colony planet was a once-breeding ground for the nasty aliens , and now all communication with the planet has been lost . . . 

it doesn't exactly take a genius to guess what happens next : ripley agrees , and before you can say "" big mistake "" , she and the half dozen marines , plus the slimy corporate guy ( reiser ) , who has more than it looks like up under his sleeve , are off to the colony . 

when they arrive , they find the planet in ruins . 

only one survivor is found , a little girl , newt , who confirms that , yes , the aliens were here and that she only managed to survive by hidding in the ventilation system . 

and soon enough , the marines come under attack from the aliens . . . 

what happens for the next hour and a half or so is what completely sets this movie apart from any other standard alien sci-fi movie : the action scenes . 

cameron directs them so skillfully , and so suspensefully , that you're literally ringing your hands by the time the finale rolls around . 

which features , in my opinion , the best fight scene ever recorded on film , as ripley straps herself into a huge robot and battles the nasty queen alien to the death . 

many people will tell you that this film , while being a great action film , has no real drama and is all cliches . 

well , they would be wrong , my friends . 

if this film had no "" drama "" , then why was sigourney weaver nominated for best actress at the 1987 academy awards ? 

that's right , best actress . 

you know that any action film that has an oscar nomination attached to it for something other than technical stuff like editing and f/x has got to be good . 

in short , aliens combines all the right elements ( great action and f/x , drama , a good plot , good dialogue , and great villains ) into what could arguably be called the best action film of all time . 

then again , maybe not . 

movies rise and fall from glory and , sad to say , aliens was wrestled from it's throne of best action movie by another cameron film , t2 : judgement day , in 1991 . 

so who will be the next king ? 

well , let's wait until december 19th and see yet another james cameron film-the highest budgeted film of all time-titanic to make that decision . 

i can't wait .

" "" in dreams "" might keep you awake at night , but not because of its creepy imagery , bizarre visual style or story about a clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths . 

no , the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movie's brutally squandered potential , the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise - even by tired serial killer genre standards . 

the big letdown , however , comes upon the realization that this 100-minute head-scratcher was masterminded by neil jordan , the man behind "" the crying game . "" 

he's no stranger to cinematic weirdness , but this nutty nonsense really pushes the envelope . 

things start out strong enough , with cinematographer darius khondji's stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of a underwater ghost town during a creepy prologue that establishes a notably grim tone right off the bat . 

this eerie opulence remains a dazzling display of showmanship throughout the entire film - there's even something macabre about the way khondji photographs a rustic , seemingly innocent new england autumn - but if there ever was a film that didn't deserve so good a polish , it's this one . 

don't knock the look , but say what you will about the foolish plot , underdeveloped characters and flat dialogue . 

annette bening , another asset "" in dreams "" shouldn't be so lucky to boast , gives an increasingly effective performance in a role that doesn't do much for her in return . 

she plays claire cooper , a massachusetts children's book illustrator who's plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped children . 

she thinks these visions are a warning knell for horrible , soon-to-be-committed crimes , but neither her ho-hum husband ( aidan quinn ) nor the ho-hummer police can muster up the sense to take her seriously . 

this being a thriller , we know that she is , in fact , on the money , and it's a credit to bening's acting that she delves equally into claire's madness and compassion . 

but as soon as a body turns up and claire has given the authorities reason enough to believe her claims , "" in dreams "" trades in its nifty supernatural chills for a long series of allegedly spooky jolts that simply refuse to make sense . 

scenes pile up like a car wreck with little or no explanation or exposition . 

subplots appear and disappear . 

when claire finally comes face-to-face with our evil murderer ( robert downey jr . ) , it turns out his name is vivian , he's clairvoyant and he's got some major issues with mama , a la norman bates . 

 "" in dreams "" reaches its absurdist zenith here , and the climax drags with mumbled revelations and laughable twists . 

some questions , then : what's with the garbage disposal retching applesauce ? 

are the drawings on the wall blood or paint ? 

who cranked up the andrews sisters on the cd player and caused the swing to move on its own ? 

what about the computer ? 

does vivian possess the gift of telekinesis in addition to his other powers ? 

why would he continually endanger claire if she was necessary for his ultimate plan ? 

is the woman in australia integral to anything ? 

and the aforementioned flooded city - what function does that _really_ serve ? 

sigh . 

at least in my own dreams , i can imagine a better movie where certain talent didn't go to waste .

"the army comedy genre has never turned out a truly good movie ( if you don't count neil simon's biloxi blues ) . 

year after year , more predictably cliched military movies come out -- most recently sgt . 

bilko -- and none of them ever manage to be anything more than a rehash of the last . 

i thought stripes would be different . 

with ivan reitman as director , bill murray as star and harold ramis as co-star and co-screenwriter , it seemed like it would be ghostbusters in the army . 

instead , it was a bunch of unfunny crap in the army . 

murray , about as funny and sophisticated here as he was in meatballs , plays a loser cab driver who sees the army as his only chance for success , and convinces his friend ramis to enlist with him . 

so he does , and we get the obligatory drill sergeant from hell , head-shaving and marching/singing sequences , more mind-numbingly stale here than ever . 

the characters are even less original , ranging from underachieving slob john candy to incompetent captain john larroquette . 

all the big name stars in stripes ( and even larroquette ) fall victim to the lame , rehashed material and are never really likeable , murray in particular . 

he only gets a few decent lines in , although those barely-funny one liners pale in comparison to the hilarious peter venkman character he played three years later in ghostbusters . 

he was even better in caddyshack , for crying out loud . 

as with a lot of the late 70's / early 80's comedies , stripes is a completely juvenile movie only a child would like but is so sex- obsessed no child should be able to watch it . 

i'm sure it seems funny on paper to have candy pay over $400 to mud wrestle five beautiful women , but while watching it all that was coming out of my mouth was the admonition "" dear god ! "" 

every few seconds . 

stripes isn't the playful kind of sex comedy , either . 

most of the time it seems downright misogynistic , as when larroquette uses his telescope to peer into the women's showers or murray lifts a female m . p . 

onto the stove and , with an i-know-what-you-like look on his face , says he's going to give her the "" aunt jemima treatment , "" which means shoving a spatula under her butt repeatedly . 

you don't want to stick around as the scene progresses and he uses an ice cream scoop on her genital region . 

 "" i'm not enjoying this , "" the woman protests . 

my sentiments exactly .

" "" say , any of you know how to madison ? "" 

--- brad "" asshole "" majors ( barry bostwick ) shows just how unhip he is after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode to the time warp in the cult classic the rocky horror picture show . 

the story behind the rocky horror picture show is one of legend . 

in the early 70's , stage actor turned first-time playwright richard o'brien decided he wanted to make a musical homage to the crazy b-movies he had grown up with as a child , set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own design . 

the result was the stage play the rocky horror show , which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in 1973 and was even hailed the best musical of 1973 by prominent drama critics in england . 

the play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later , in october of 1974 . 

the film version ( now titled the rocky horror picture show ) was released in 1975 . . . 

and immediately tanked at the box office . 

whether it was because fox wasn't quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didn't quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined , but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop . 

it seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters . 

a year later , something entirely strange and magical happened . 

prints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country , and it was then that a whole new audience found the film . 

this new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film , acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played , yelling rude comments at the screen , and just generally having a good time . 

word quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture show's life as the ultimate cult film was born . 

for the virgins out there who are unaware , the plot centers around a loving couple , brad majors ( barry bostwick ) and janet weiss ( susan sarandon ) , who come from a small town called denton . 

brad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed . 

they plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting , dr . everett scott ( jonathan adams , who played the narrator in the original stage version ) , but their car gets a flat on the way to his home . 

remembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road , they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance . 

the castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual ( in the galaxy of transylvania ) , who are lead by the eccentric fishnet-stocking wearing mad scientist dr . frank-n-furter ( tim curry ) . 

frank-n-furter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form of rocky ( peter hinwood ) . 

as rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment , brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of frank-n-furter's mad schemes . 

little do any of them know that the doctor's handyman , riff-raff ( original author richard o'brien ) , and domestic , magenta ( patricia quinn ) , are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth . 

going back and revisiting this film after ten years ( 1990 being the first time i had ever seen it ) , it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had the staying power that it has . 

if i had been a fox executive around the time of its release , i don't think i would have known what to make of it either . 

for all intents and purposes it is a bad movie ( though bad in a really good sort of way ) , but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film . 

by the time the credits role , it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters , and one really gets the feeling that richard o'brien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy b-movies his film is based on . 

when i say that the wall-to-wall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that , once you hear them , they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity . 

it goes without saying that the "" time warp "" is the most popular song in the film . 

even people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song . 

what those who haven't seen the movie don't know though , is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment . 

my personal favorite is "" over at the frankenstein place "" , but "" dammit janet "" is also maddeningly catchy . 

tim curry's vocals on the rocking tune "" sweet transvestite "" need to be heard to be believed . 

the finale of the film , a big floor show staged by frank-n-furter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets ( including barry bostwick . . . 

frightening ! ) , features no less than four songs ( "" rose tint my world "" , "" don't dream it "" , "" wild and untamed thing "" , and "" i'm going home "" ) , all of which are immensely singable . 

the film's true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though . 

despite the catchiness of the songs , this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadn't have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be a part of their own little floor show . 

watching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans ( unless you don't mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place ) . 

note : director jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film , in the form of a sequel , resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment , which picks up with brad and janet ( this time played by cliff de young and jessica harper ! ) as contestants on a game show in their home town of denton . 

the two are menaced by the evil tv station manager ( also played by de young ) , who wishes to claim janet as his own . 

o'brien returned as a writer/performer on the project ( as did quinn , campbell , and gray in performance capacity only ) , but the film had nowhere near the spirit of the original . 

25 years later , this film is still the pinnacle of cult filmdom and is continuously screened at midnight all over the world . 

as a lasting testament to the longevity of the film and its legion of fans , a brand new special edition 2-disc dvd set has been released that is the most comprehensive compendium of rocky horror to date ( even out shining the laserdisc special edition that was released for its 20th anniversary ) . 

if you are one of those people who can't get enough of the film , this disc should be more than enough to satisfy your appetites . 

in an attempt to recreate the interactivity of the film , fox home entertainment has released this wonderful 2-disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that it'll take a good eight hours just to take in the majority of it all . 

the film itself is located on the first disc and has been given a beautiful transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) . 

the film is presented in two different versions , the us theatrical version and the uk version which adds a musical number during the finale called "" superheroes "" . 

for ambitious viewers , the disc also includes a hidden version ( located on the main menu by clicking left from the scene selection menu choice and highlighting a pair of lips in the lower left corner ) which presents the film in the manner it was originally supposed to have been seen . 

originally , the film was to have been similar to the wizard of oz , with the first half of the it seen in black and white ( and not changing to color until the transylvanians are first revealed to brad and janet during the time warp musical number ) . 

most reports , including a documentary on the disc , say that the color was supposed to appear when frank-n-furter first shows up in the elevator , but it does seem to work better where it was placed on this version , depicting the vast difference between the world brad and janet were used to compared with the one to which they are introduced . 

the film contains a commentary track by show creator ( and faithful handyman ) richard o'brien and co-star patricia quinn which is fairly enjoyable ( and quinn immediately starts off by refusing to speak about sarandon nearly contracting pneumonia while having to walk around wet and half-naked on freezing cold sets , which she apparently complained about the entire film and in future interviews ) . 

the two seem like old friends and have great stories to tell , but they also point out cast members that are sadly no longer with us anymore ( and there are quite a few ) . 

fox has also tried to recreate the feel of attending the film in a theater with several audience participation segments . 

the first feature ( and the most simple ) is a subtitle prompter which lets you know when to open up on people with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is . 

the second feature is an audience participation track , which lets you in on what you might hear on a good night out at the show . 

most of the comments are unintelligible because it is basically just a large group of people screaming their heads off , but every once and a while a comment can be heard that will invoke a bit of laughter . 

the final participation segment uses a technology very much like the technology used on the matrix dvd , where a pair of lips will appear on-screen during certain scenes of the film ( mostly during the musical numbers ) that can be selected by pressing enter on your remote . 

when selected , you will be taken out of the film and into a live participation version of the scene put on during one of the many screenings that occur all over the world . 

once the segment is over , you are deposited right back into the film where you left off . 

the first disc also contains a few dvd-rom goodies for those with that particular type of dvd player . 

there is a timeline of the evolution from the stage play version to worldwide cult sensation , a video jukebox , a you don't know jack-styled trivia game ( which is about as bare bones a you don't know jack parody as it can be ) , and a bizarre mad-libs styled word game known as riff-raff's story lab . 

links to the rocky horror websites are also available from the dvd-rom portion of the disc . 

the second disc features even more goodies for the person who loves extras . 

former lite-rock video channel turned music historians vh-1 have allowed some of their outtake footage from the "" behind the music : rocky horror "" special that they ran earlier in the year to be shown here , as well as a pop-up video for the meat loaf-sung "" hot patootie "" . 

the "" behind the music "" segments are all very interesting , especially richard o'brien's jaunt through the castle ( which is now a hotel ! ) where the film was originally shot . 

there are also extensions of the sarandon , bostwick , quinn , o'brien , and meat loaf interviews . 

as far as extras for the film itself go , there are two deleted musical numbers that are also included here . 

one of which is just the "" superheroes "" number available in the uk version , but there is also another rare musical number presented here called "" once in a while "" . 

a series of alternate takes are also presented here , but none of them are really much of a revelation ( except for the undressing scene in which we see that patricia quinn is having a hard time unbuttoning barry bostwick's pants ) . 

for the completist who must have every little bit of rocky horror paraphernalia , a misprinted end sequence and alternate credit sequence are also presented here . 

rounding out the disc is a decent documentary called rocky horror double feature video show , two theatrical trailers ( proclaiming that the film is "" a different sort of jaws "" ) , a still gallery , and two sing-a-longs ( for "" toucha toucha touch me "" and "" sweet transvestite "" ) . 

fox's special edition is the dvd set that rocky horror fans have been waiting for all their lives ( "" you're lucky . . . 

i'm lucky . . . 

he's lucky . . . 

we're all lucky ! "" ) . 

it's not just amazing enough that tons of classic italian films are finally getting their recognition in the u . s . , but even long standing traditions are finally receiving their due on the wonderful dvd format . 

as with their excellent dvds of the abyss , fight club , independence day , and the sound of music , fox shows that they have most certainly made the commitment to provide the things that dvd lovers want . 

i raise a toast to them ( cue the throwing of the bread ) as i cut out the lights , sit back , and watch those disembodied lips begin to sing about b-movie tradition .

" "" be gentle , "" urges natasha henstridge to matthew perry in "" the whole nine yards . "" 

 "" i haven't made love in five years . "" 

 "" neither have i , "" rebuts perry . 

 "" i'm married ! "" 

if jonathan lynn's latest comedy relied simply on jokes of that caliber--and it certainly tries--then it'd be an innocuous if rather obvious little film . 

instead , its failings go much deeper . 

first off , who hasn't had enough of the tough wiseguy intimidates the timid wise guy genre ? 

if you want to make a pretty penny or two in hollywood nowadays simply write a "" comedy "" which pairs a robert de niro/james caan/bruce willis type with a billy crystal/hugh grant/matthew perry type and wait for the royalties to roll in . 

who's next ? 

jack nicholson and martin short ? 

it certainly doesn't have to be funny . 

 "" the whole nine yards "" is not a particularly funny film , but it is borderline offensive . 

offensive in the way it continues a trend of poking fun at career criminals who wouldn't think twice about pushing your mother-in-law off the brooklyn bridge with her feet encased in concrete . 

that might sound like a funny sight gag , but the problem is these films have long since lost sight of the fact that taking a human life isn't all that funny to begin with . 

when the corpse is placed in a car , doused with gasoline , set ablaze and referred to as "" barbecue , "" it makes you wonder when all this playing killing for laughs is going to end . 

 "" the whole nine yards "" is also offensive in so much as its three central female characters are portrayed as nothing more than sex objects . 

rosanna arquette plays a slutty , chain-smoking french canadian who's married to matthew perry's none-too-successful dentist . 

it's an unflattering role made all the more so by the unflattering outfits--and unflattering situations--into which arquette is thrust . 

then there's natasha henstridge ( "" species "" i and ii ) who plays the well-to-do wife of contract killer bruce willis . 

she gets involved with perry's character when he comes to chicago hoping to negotiate a finder's fee with mob boss yanni gogolack ( kevin pollack , transposing his vs with his ws ) after willis' jimmy the tulip tudeski moves in next door . 

henstridge and perry's characters hitting it off is about as likely as bruce and demi getting back together . 

perry might have the charm but he doesn't have the physical attributes of a traditional leading man , especially in close-up . 

most objectified of the bunch is amanda peet , who turns in a sexually-ripe performance as perry's dental assistant with , it transpires , questionable career goals . 

peet's gratuitous nude scene proves how low this movie will stoop to keep its audience from dropping off . 

when "" my cousin vinny "" is the highpoint of a directorial career including such forgettable films as "" clue , "" "" greedy , "" and "" sgt . 

bilko , "" you have to wonder if lynn chose the wrong career path . 

perry's pratfalling goofiness coupled with willis' likable hardness could have had some potential but with no script to work with , and a director who seems to be watching from the wings , their characters run out of gas quickly . 
"
"let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film , i really wasn't looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films . 

i'm not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever-present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years . 

i'm happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film . 

by that point , it was evident that mr . bond was back with a vengeance . 

all doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren't exactly a pleasant experience . 

it seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts . 

it took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in . 

i guess they can be excused though , taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain . 

anyway , after somebody remembered what the light switch was for , i settled in for bond . 

i think the most noticeable aspect of this , the 19th film in the series , is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films . 

there were probably more one-liners in this movie than in the last several combined . 

and bond's last one-liner in the film is about the best of the series . 

the world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series . 

everything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007 . 

for the most part , the action sequences worked very well . 

although , there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top , even for a bond film . 

i think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted . 

while he did a good job for the most part , there were points in the movie , specifically during action sequences , that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film . 

most noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie . 

he almost seemed like he didn't know what he was doing . 

but they were brief scenes and really shouldn't take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing . 

if you have ever seen a bond film , you won't be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit . 

the world is not enough is no exception . 

this time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world . 

007 matches wits with the terrorist renard ( robert carlyle ) , a man who has a bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain . 

why this point is included is beyond me . 

they took great pains to explain his condition , but it only came up later in the movie as a scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought . 

anyway , renard , like the typical terrorist that he is , is bent on some harebrained scheme involving a mid-east oil pipeline . 

i guess world domination just isn't as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore . 

bond is brought in to protect the pipeline's owner , elektra king ( sophie marceau ) , who is the daughter of one of renard's recent victims . 

along the way , bond has to enlist the help of a nuclear scientist , dr . christmas jones ( denise richards ) , and his old rival valentin zukovsky ( robert carlyle ) . 

like all bond films , you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot , since it is ridiculous beyond words . 

my biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films . 

there was at least one point that i had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing . 

the buddy that i saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceau's character . 

it was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly -- although not included in the film . 

later , it became a big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something . 

but because it is a bond film , the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about script problems quite quickly . 

after all , it isn't shakespeare . 

how about the cast ? 

brosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances as 007 . 

i grew up with the roger moore version of bond , so i really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character . 

judi dench , as m , had a bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearances in the role . 

she brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner . 

robbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye , so it was nice to see his russian mobster character revived in this movie . 

coltrane gets more screen time , which simply leads to him stealing even more scenes . 

then there are the bond girls . 

sophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today . 

there is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her a natural to play the innocent victim . 

those that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just a pretty face . 

marceau may be the most talented actress to ever play a bond love interest . 

then we have denise richards . 

there was no doubt in my mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks . 

and after you see the outfits she wears , you won't have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producer's eyes . 

i was pleasantly surprised to find that she really did a good job playing a nuclear scientist . 

admittedly , there was one point that the audience snickered a bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue , but other than that she stacks up ( no pun intended ) to her bond girl predecessors nicely . 

i must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyle's character . 

while carlyle did a fine job with the material that he had , his character just never worked for me . 

the producers tried very hard to add more complexity to his character , but it just never quite got off the ground . 

i guess i was hoping for a bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character , but the writers decided to play up the emotional side of his character . 

this might have worked well in another movie , but i don't go to see bond movies for their deep characterizations . 

last , but not least , we have desmond llewelyn as q . this is the 17th appearance for llewelyn as bond's gadget guy , and he is as good as ever . 

although his screen time has grown far more limited in the past few films , he is still a treat to watch . 

rumors abound that this may be his last appearance in the role . 

he says future appearances are up to a higher power . 

the producers have introduced his protege and future replacement , a bumbling and somewhat pompous character played by comedy master john cleese . 

while we don't see much of him in this film , i think it is fair to say that desmond llewelyn's legacy , whenever it is passed on , will be in very capable hands . 

so how does it stack up ? 

despite some problems , the world is not enough is a very entertaining movie . 

and , all things considered , what problems it does have are small compared to some that have plagued earlier bond movies . 

this is easily the best of the brosnan films . 

it may even be the best of the entire series , certainly in the top 3 . 

one thing is for sure , even after 19 movies , there is still plenty of life left in the james bond series . 

here's looking forward to bond number 20 .

"one of the sweetest tales to ever be made , it's a wonderful life isn't perfect , but its good natured charm and beautiful performances light up the screen with glorious results . 

probably the greatest "" feel-good "" film of all time , it's a wonderful life aims for the heart , and strikes with a golden arrow . 

on christmas eve , george bailey ( stewart ) is being prayed for by many in the small town of bedford falls . 

you see , george is in trouble , and he has always helped others who needed it . 

this one time , however , god answers his prayers , and sends down the lovable guardian angel clarence ( travers ) to try and save george . 

clarence has got his own problems , however . 

clarence is an angel without his wings , and each time the bell rings , the wings pass him by . 

the bailey case is a way for him to earn those magical wings and become a true angel . 

but before clarence can save george , he first has to go through a cliffs notes version of george bailey's life . 

we see george sacrificing his hearing to save his brother's life , sacrificing his college education to save the family business , sacrificing his dream of living far away to support his brother , and even sacrificing his life to make sure his brother is happy working somewhere else . 

when the bank his family owns is in trouble , george gives away his honeymoon money to make sure the bank isn't sold to the evil mr . potter ( barrymore ) , who wants nothing less than to get the baileys out of bedford falls . 

one christmas , potter gets his chance . 

uncle billy bailey ( mitchell ) loses $8 , 000 of the bank's money . 

without the money , the bank must close down . 

george is stuck in a tremendous bind , and contemplates suicide . 

clarence , the faithful servant , is there just to pick him up , and to show him what bedford would be like without george . 

this is all a lead-in to the very famous last scene , where george finally sees what true happiness is about . 

it's a wonderful life does have its faults . 

the movie is beginning to feel dated in the details , especially in the treatment of women and men . 

the sex roles in the film are weirdly out of place in the 90's , like something out of a revisionist look . 

all the men drink too much and slap their wives too much during some portions of the film . 

there are , however , endearing moments in all of this . 

capra puts in just enough humor mocking the sex roles of the 50's to make the movie remarkably enjoyable . 

the story is hackneyed , and the ending feels , well , a little too sugarish . 

there's this uneasy feeling of sugar over everything , especially the sequences where george is either in trouble , or helping somebody . 

it's a little too nice for my liking , at times . 

there is , however , enough humor , enough wit , and enough of jimmy stewart to get the movie through the middle part , which would be the most difficult . 

but watching it's a wonderful life is never boring or difficult : it's always interesting , right until the finale , which , for all its sugar , makes delightful sense and is beautifully done . 

capra does have his monumental cliches , but the actors relish them and overplay everything to perfection . 

donna reed is perfect as the loving , obeidient wife , and lionel barrymore is gloriously grump as mr . potter . 

everyone else is magnificent , including bert and ernie ( ward bond and frank faylen ) . 

there is a general sense of goodness , as if everyone in the film knows that they are making a great film , and they relish that . 

stewart , however , is the king of all of this . 

he is sometimes awkward , especially when saying "" merry christmas "" to all objects , animate or inanimate . 

but he is james stewart , and he's lovably delightful throughout the film . 

have i complained ? 

i shouldn't have . 

this is a really good movie . 

no , this is a great movie . 

better yet , this is a phenomenal movie . 

there is a reason classics are invented : to make sure that people will always have great movies to aid them in their quest for living life . 

this is one of those films . 

it is a "" feel-good "" movie , something people complain a little too much about . 

but capra's reworking of "" a christmas carol "" is the greatest christmas movie of all time . 

there , i've said it . 

i have to admit , the first time i saw this , i saw it with my family , including my 11 year old kid sister . 

they all loved it . 

they loved george , his wife , his troubles , and the beautiful ending . 

is it a little too sugar-coated ? 

maybe . 

no matter . 

this is a film that should be watched time and time again , with families around a coffee table , and eggnog on the plate . 

it is a film that just makes you feel good about life , family , and hope . 

it is the perfect christmas film , flaws and all . 

it is frank capra's greatest acheivement , and that really does say a lot . 

for about 121 out of 129 minutes , this movie is flawless . 

the rest can be excused : no film is perfectly flawless . 

i can't get over how much i love this movie , and how much you will , after watching it , digesting it , and sitting with your family , appreciating how special life really is .

"my summer was recently saved by two very different movies . 

on opening night , i saw american pie 2 and laughed like a moron . 

then a few nights later , i watched and thoroughly enjoyed joel hershman's greenfingers even though it didn't feature a trip to band camp , girl-on-girl action , or seann william scott . 

however , i felt just as good leaving american pie 2 as i did after leaving greenfingers , which tells the offbeat tale of british murderer colin briggs ( clive owen of croupier ) . 

after spending roughly half of his life behind bars , he is transferred to a more lenient facility , edgefield . 

the picaresque , rustic prison allows its inmates to learn a trade , while enjoying accommodations generally found at most colleges . 

at first , briggs doesn't want to be there . 

he's used to living as a prisoner and wants to be left alone . 

however , his ailing roommate , fergus ( david kelly of waking ned devine ) , wears briggs down through his benign nature . 

the two become friends , with fergus giving colin a packet of violet seeds as a christmas gift . 

briggs is astonished when the violets grow in the limestone soil , and begins a fight with three other prisoners when an errant soccer ball smashes his beloved flowers . 

after the prison's governor ( warren clarke ) reprimands them , he's awed at what briggs has accomplished . 

and he's struck by an idea -- briggs , fergus and the other men will grow a garden on the prison's grounds . 

greenfingers , which is "" inspired by actual events , "" becomes a bit like a sports movie after that . 

despite their differences , the men come together and through hard work and love earn a spot at the big game -- in this case a prestigious garden show . 

one renegade , in this case , briggs , will prove to have talent . 

of course , love will also rear its head ( no , not "" prison love "" ) . 

to hershman's credit , he doesn't pump up the drama or try for cheap laughs , like last year's lame marijuana comedy saving grace . 

i had to keep pinching myself when i didn't see a single scene of a hardened con sneezing over a pot of pansies , or the men giving high-fives over a particularly stunning batch of wildflowers . 

the movie deals with people and scores on that concept . 

it's wonderful seeing briggs turn from a bitter prisoner to a man who cares again . 

give credit to owen for keeping his cool in a part that begs for overacting . 

his speech to the parole board about being reborn through gardening is the best scene of its kind since morgan freeman's last stand in the shawshank redemption . 

owen's bedside scenes with kelly , who lends the film a human touch , are a marvel to behold , emotionally gripping without being sappy . 

written by hershman , greenfingers contains plenty of laughs . 

most come courtesy of helen mirren , who shines as the world-class gardener who works with the inmates but fears for her daughter primrose ( natasha little ) when she starts dating briggs . 

the mother can't believe what he'll do if her daughter "" burns the sunday roast . "" 

nothing is forced in greenfingers . 

the funny lines come forth naturally in conversations and not from punch lines . 

primrose and briggs' relationship takes awkward steps . 

even when briggs decides to go back to edgefield , it's done for reasons of loyalty , not because the movie requires him to do so . 

after grimacing through the forced screwball antics of movies like america's sweethearts and the princess dairies , it's an almost indescribable pleasure to see a director taking his time to tell a story very well . 
"
" "" through a spyglass , i could see everything . "" 

king louis xvi was beheaded on january 21 , 1793 , but instead of visualizing this act of regicide , legendary auteur eric rohmer's the lady and the duke observes from afar . 

consider it a view to a kill made abstract . 

a proper british ( yes , british ) gentlewoman , grace elliott ( lucy russell ) , and her loyal maidservant gaze from a lofty terrace in meudon at the glistening city of paris , where raucous crowds seem tinier than ants . 

the maid narrates what little she sees of the execution through her telescope ( often muttering , "" i don't know , "" ) as the sound of cheering patriots and revolutionaries echoes through the air . 

what we don't see might not be able to hurt us . 

just close your eyes and think of england . 

during times of revolution , the aristocracy may feel a false sense of calm in their parlor halls , discussing tumultuous events over glasses of sherry until the walls cave in on them . 

adapted from elliott's memoirs , journal of my life during the french revolution , rohmer's latest artistic tour-de-force may seem far removed from his domestic comedies ( tales of the four seasons , etc . ) , a period film set during the most violent changes in french history . 

resisting the temptation for grand-scale theatrics , much of the lady and the duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes . 

grace elliott makes for an unlikely protagonist : a headstrong , snobbish blueblood , one unprepared for the machinations of history that sweep her along . 

a foreigner who accepts the french king as her own , grace's life seems defined by fancy attire and lively political debate with her former lover , the king's hot-blooded cousin , prince philipe , duke of orleans ( jean-claude dreyfus ) . 

the times are changing , though , and the gears inch ever closer toward violence . 

during the september massacres of 1792 , she is encountered by a procession of rioters brandishing the head of the duke's sister-in-law on a stake . 

rohmer makes a harsh transition from tranquil , old fashioned , almost stagy parlor scenes to the swell of an angry mob . 

in doing so , he achieves what braveheart and the patriot could not : the face of death . 

when grace sees her friend's disembodied head on a pole , rohmer's attention drifts from the societal change to one woman's reaction shot , laden with hot tears . 

grace finds herself taking in a fugitive from justice , sheltering him from the mob . 

through her relationship with the duke , she seeks a passport for this one activist's escape . 

grace doesn't even understand her own actions ( and the duke reacts in stunned disbelief at how she places herself in such danger ) . 

she endures persecution from robespierre and his gang of thuggish equalizers , ceaseless police monitoring , house searches , even a brief imprisonment for harmless international correspondence . 

maintaining her stiff upper lip and pampered life ( her imperious attitude to the servants never changes ) , she becomes a heroine through circumstance . 

the events themselves are intrusions upon her person , her home , and therefore her values . 

aristocracy proves a glass house , one that can barely withstand the upheaval of stones . 

the duke is called to vote on the king's punishment , and despite his hours of deliberation with friends and advisors , talk means nothing in the face of bloody action ( or futile inaction ) . 

the episodic structure creates a wobbly , jarring detachment from the events of the french revolution , which serves as metaphor but also disconnects potential audience identification . 

lazy viewers ( and critics ) may also complain that knowledge of french history is required for enjoyment of the lady and the duke . 

that's foolery , but brings up the valid criticism that rohmer's characters occasionally become didactic . 

rohmer's imperfect but assured push toward the future remains staunch and notable for casting a cautious eye upon the past while taking bold steps forward into an uncertain future . 

what may arouse interest in the lady and the duke outside of foreign film enthusiasts with literary and historical passions is rohmer's use of cutting edge digital technology as a means of exploring the theme of artifice as safety net or coping mechanism . 

the actors were filmed against a bluescreen , then placed against painted backdrops recreating the vastness of 18th century paris . 

this recreation calls attention to itself in every shot , a technicolor dream of fanciful buildings and wide-open streets . 

it looks as phony as titanic , but unlike james cameron's debacle , the lady and the duke plays with the notion of false security in those walls of stone . 

why ? 

they aren't real . 

the very foundation rohmer's characters stand upon is false , and in their groundlessness they must discover themselves , in all their insubstantial glory . 

screened at the 2001 new york film festival ( feature coming soon ) .

" "" the faculty , "" the heavily-hyped and advertised sci-fi/horror film that has teamed up director robert rodriguez ( 1995's "" desperado "" and 1996's "" from dusk till dawn "" ) and screenwriter kevin williamson ( 1996's "" scream "" and 1997's "" scream 2 "" ) , is being called a cross between "" invasion of the body snatchers "" and "" the breakfast club , "" and i don't think i could describe it any better than that . 

the film sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem to have much in common , and then the science-fiction aspect is added , involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are actually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town . 

the six characters , as in "" the breakfast club , "" can be easily labeled as a stereotype , but as they are developed , they become far more complex : casey ( elijah wood ) , the much picked upon nerd ; stokely ( clea duvall ) , a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being a lesbian so everyone will avoid her ; zeke ( josh hartnett ) , a drug dealer who turns out to be a science whiz ; stan ( shawn hatosy ) , the star football quarterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate more on academics ; delilah ( jordanna brewster ) , the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist ; and marybeth ( laura harris ) , the sweet 'n southern new girl in town . 

although the characters are only slightly connected ( i . e . 

casey is delilah's photojournalist assistant ; marybeth tries to become buddies with stokely , since they both don't have friends , etc . ) , when they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque and strange occurrences , the only people they can count on for help is each other , even though they aren't really even sure if they can trust one another . 

 "" the faculty "" is another smart and pop-culturally hip film from williamson , although it does not equal up to his best film , the original "" scream , "" and rodriguez , whose "" from dusk till dawn "" is still one of the more original genre films of the 90's . 

williamson and rodriguez are so assured at their professions , respectively , that the idea of teaming up together is pretty much a no-brainer . 

the plotline of "" the faculty , "" involving aliens taking over other people's bodies , has been done quite a lot before , from "" invasion of the body snatchers , "" to "" the puppet masters , "" to "" invaders from mars , "" so one of the obstacles that williamson and rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow make the idea seem fresh , and by setting the goings-on at a high school and having the protagonists be a group of teens , they were mostly successful . 

surely , the conventions of the story are still the same , and the climax was inevitable , but there were a few surprises along the way , including the question of who were the aliens , and who weren't . 

the epilogue was also a refreshing change-of-pace as it did not set up a sequel but ended on a note that probably could not have been any better . 

the performances in "" the faculty "" were a treat throughout , since there were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of what they usually do . 

one exception were the teens , who , aside from elijah wood , are not very well-known , but they all aquit themselves nicely , particularly wood ( the seasoned pro ) , clea duvall , and jordanna brewster . 

as members of the faculty , robert patrick ( "" t2 : judgement day "" ) was creepy as the gym coach ; piper laurie was amusing and threatening as the drama teacher ; bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able to look like an alien ; and salma hayek , as the school nurse with a bad case of the cold , was very funny in a small role . 

the standout , in my opinion , of the whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who , after turning into an alien , becomes the sex bombshell . 

if there was any problem i had with the faculty , it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence . 

since the teenagers realize that in order to save everyone they must kill the "" queen "" alien , many of the faculty members disappear . 

it might have been more fun if they had to face every one of the teachers , although the finale is still pretty impressive , and includes some showstopping creature effects , especially for a relatively low 15-million-dollar budget . 

although not one of the best horror or science-fiction films i have seen , "" the faculty "" is still an exciting and worthy film that dimension films was smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released . 

while the story is as old as the hills , it is also , in a way , timeless , because everyone , i think , has suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply did not act right , as if they really weren't human . 

and by putting this idea in the setting of a small-town high school , it perfectly contrasts with the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults and other peers . 

+ note : the ad and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading , as it features r & b artist usher raymond as one of the main characters . 

in actuality , he only has a small role as one of stan's buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team . 

if i were one of the heads from dimension , i would change this advertising at once , since it is unnecessary and rather deceiving . 
"
"vampires starts out almost in the style of a spaghetti western with an attack on a small homestead in new mexico . 

the house has a nest of vampires and jack crow ( james woods ) is leading a team of vampire hunters in to clean them out . 

while the initial imagery is a little over-dramatic , it gives way to what is a fairly decent action sequence . 

that is enough action to last us a while and we could , director john carpenter would let us , get to a story line . 

but it is not very long and there is not much plot until the next big action scene . 

then there is only a bit more of plot before the next action scene after that . 

the plot is kept to a minimum and the interesting ideas in the plot really get the short end . 

and that is something of a pity because the film , based on the book vampire$ by john steakley , gives us a myth for the origins of vampires and explains why vampires are so intertwined with religious imagery . 

this could be an interesting departure from the standard vampire film , but carpenter decides to tell us about it rather than to show it . 

what carpenter saves his serious screen time for a sequence of spectacular fights between hunters and vampires . 

there is a lot of fighting and lots of gore . 

anything intriguing is kept to a minimum to so it does not get in the way of pleasing the action film fans . 

this has not always been carpenter's style . 

his 1981 version of the thing has action but also challenges the viewer to do a little thinking about the film's central science fictional question . 

jack crow heads a vampire swat team , cleaning up nests of vampires with high-tech spears and crossbows . 

in the early part of the film his team is wiped out by a particularly mean vampire valek ( thomas ian griffith ) who has been tipped off to who crow is . 

now crow team is gone and he is down to himself and his sidekick tony montoya ( daniel baldwin ) . 

to make matters worse , he does not know the people on his own side , tony and his backers , he can trust . 

meanwhile jack is sure the vampires are looking for something that must be hidden somewhere here in new mexico . 

if this is sounding like a very tired police corruption plot with a few obvious substitutions , that's exactly what it is . 

the same story looks just as well with two partner cops looking for a gang of hood who are themselves looking for a packet of heroin . 

but carpenter goes against a familiar principle of film : show people , don't tell them . 

just about everything in the plot other than the fights we are told about in the dialog and not shown . 

fundamental questions in the plot like where does crow get his funding , why are the vampires in new mexico--what do they want and why do they want it , what is the connection of the vampires and the catholic church , how did crow come to be a vampire hunter and why devote his life to it ? 

the answers to any of these questions could have been dramatized , but instead are revealed through dialog . 

now if all this was not bad enough , carpenter misuses the james wood persona . 

woods plays a particular sort of cool lowlife very well . 

but carpenter leads off the film by having woods do some sergio-leone- style mythic posturing . 

while his crew prepares for an attack he stands staring fixedly through shades at the house that will be his target . 

woods does not work as a larger than life mythic hero . 

that is not his style and it just does not work very well . 

there are some simple things that carpenter should be looking for as director that he misses . 

in one scene we are looking at a motel room with dead people on the floor . 

one female corpse is on the floor in front of a chair so that there is about an inch of daylight between her and the chair . 

as the actress breathes the gap widening and narrowing makes it obvious her arm is moving up and down . 

one also wonders how the existence of vampires is kept secret . 

these vampires do not maintain a low profile . 

there are arguably logical flaws in the film . 

there is some question in my mind whether carpenter has a consistent policy on what effect bullets have on vampires . 

it would take some rationalization to explain why in some scenes sunlight has a dramatic effect on vampires , yet in a scene toward the end a vampire can walk under a burned roof that lets him be swept by beams of sunlight . 

i suspect that the book on which this film was based was better thought out . 

while i might recommend this film to an action audience i would say that what i look for in a vampire film vampires rates a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . 

perhaps i will read the book . 
"
"the first thing you notice about this movie is that it's cold . 

placed in minnesota and north dakota during the winter , many of the scenes take place outside with long scenes of snow-covered ground against a background of white . 

just what we need as bloomington struggles out of the endless long cold night . 

as with most coen brothers films , this features outlandish characters in nefarious schemes , each of which works out in the oddest way possible . 

a car salesman hires a couple of hoods to kidnap his wife so that he can collect the ransom from her father . 

along the way everything that can possibly go wrong does . 

in brief scenes of vicious violence , people get shot through the head , in the back , face , chest and various other areas of the anatomy . 

there is also one of the most unpleasant body disposal scenes yet seen on the screen . 

remarkably enough , most of the movie is played for laughs . 

even more remarkably , it works . 

the only likable person in the film is the very pregnant sheriff ( frances mcdormand ) who hunts down the killers while eating at every possible opportunity . 

with every good film the audience gains new knowledge . 

here you learn _two_ things . 

everyone in minnesota speaks in an annoying whining accent that would drive you crazy . 

and don't do violent illegal business with low-life amoral degenerate scum-sucking losers . 

oh yeah , if you get shot in the face , using a brightly decorated napkin to stop the bleeding just makes you look goofy .

"when i arrived in paris in june , 1992 , i was surprised to find france plastered with posters twin peaks : fire walk with me , since the movie wasn't scheduled to open in the u . s . until late august . 

happily , the film--the prequel to david lynch's cult television series--was playing in a fancy , thx theater . 

unfortunately , the theater was far more impressive than the movie , which absolutely stinks , much like a french lavatory . 

worse , actually . 

fire walk with me ( directed by lynch ) will be completely incomprehensible to anyone who has not seen the tv series or read "" laura palmer's secret diary . "" 

for "" twin peaks "" junkies , like me , the movie is only marginally improved . 

the plot is jumbled and illogical , not to mention excruciatingly sluggish . 

the first 30 minutes , which have almost nothing to do with the main story line , feature chris isaak and kiefer sutherland as fbi agents investigating a murder in portland , oregon . 

the movie then stops in philadelphia for a nonsensical cameo by david bowie and a brief appearance by kyle maclachlan as dale cooper . 

lynch then drops this plot strand altogether and abruptly shifts the setting to twin peaks , washington--one year later . 

ah , twin peaks : "" familiar territory , "" you think to yourself as angelo badalamenti's distinctive musical score chimes in . 

wrong ! 

the movie proves that you really can't go home again , or at least lynch can't . 

only about a quarter of the characters from the tv series appear in the movie : leland palmer , bobby briggs , james , shelly , leo , the log lady and a few others--mostly in meaningless cameos . 

the rest of the "" twin peaks "" cast is nowhere to be seen , and consequently , lynch fails to recreate the spirit and flavor of tv's most enigmatic town . 

cast members michael ontkean , sherilyn fenn , piper laurie , and richard beymer are sorely missed , not to mention lara flynn boyle , who has been replaced by lackluster moira kelly in the crucial role of donna . 

the movie concentrates solely on laura palmer ( sheryl lee ) as she suffers through drug abuse , prostitution , and incest , during her miserable last seven days on earth . 

the night of laura's death , which is truly terrifying , is the film's only remotely effective sequence . 

we finally get to see exactly what happened to laura after she jumped off james' motorcycle and ran into the woods at that lonely traffic light in the middle of nowhere . 

her murder unfolds just as agent cooper reconstructed it in the tv series , which is gratifying for faithful "" twin peaks "" viewers . 

but it's an awfully small reward for sitting through a painfully awful movie . 
"
"the computer-animated comedy "" shrek "" is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups . 

for children , it offers imaginative visuals , appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces , loads of action and a barrage of big laughs ( including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances , apparently a requisite in contemporary family films ) . 

for adults , it's a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids . 

all in all , "" shrek "" is a snappy ride , although there are a couple of points i found disturbing . 

but first the basics . 

based very loosely on a 1990 children's story , "" shrek "" follows several momentous days in the life of the title character , a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using . 

shrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp , until a local nobleman disturbs his peace . 

petty tyrant lord farquaad ( take away the "" awk "" in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite one-liners ) owns the land on which shrek resides . 

he proceeds to turn the ogre's yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle . 

as a result , shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice , pinocchio , the big bad wolf , the seven dwarfs , and the three bears , to name but a few . 

an enraged shrek storms to the castle , only to find farquaad ( john lithgow ) ready to bargain . 

lord obnoxious wants to become king and the magic mirror from "" snow white "" has shown him the way . 

all he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife . 

the mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of "" the dating game "" ( when snow white is shown , the cheeky announcer purrs , "" even though she lives with seven men , she's not easy ! "" ) 

farquaad selects the lovely princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) and offers shrek a deal : if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon-protected , lava moat-filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne , the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds . 

shrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest , accompanied by a motor-mouthed donkey ( eddie murphy ) determined to make the green grump his best friend . 

they finally hook up with the princess , only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet . 

for the matter , the dragon offers a few surprises as well . 

the movie references a great many other flicks , from "" babe "" ( "" that'll do , donkey . 

that'll do "" ) to "" the graduate . "" 

but the lion's share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney . 

the public-domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits ? pinocchio is referred to as a "" possessed toy "" and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin , he bellows , "" get that dead broad off the table ! "" 

 ? but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad's royal domicile , which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom , from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like "" it's a small world . "" 

which brings me to disturbing point number one . 

i laughed at all the disney swipes , but found the mentality behind them a bit sad . 

the acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known . 

for years the two companies have tried to sabotage each other's film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day . 

and now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer . 

here's a suggestion for the two boys : grow up ! 

put the past behind you ! 

there's room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads can't play nice , then go to your rooms ! 

the other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad . 

beyond all the irreverence , "" shrek "" actually has a message : people should learn to look beyond physical appearances , because true beauty lies within . 

it's a lovely notion , but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad's diminutive stature . 

do we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable ? 

the pompous , selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers . 

adding short jokes is simply mean . 

still , "" shrek "" is a rollicking good time . 

the computer animation is mostly impressive ( although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky ) , the voice work is strong ( particularly from eddie murphy ) , the laughs come fast and furious , and the moral , tainted though it may be , is a good one . 

to trot out a clich ? , "" shrek "" is fun for all ages . 

parents , though , should remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others because they are short , tall , skinny , fat , etc . is a bad thing .

"capsule : a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg . 

joe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs . 

it lets us see some new dinosaurs ( is that an oxymoron ? ) and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure . 

the film is neither ambitious nor pretentious . 

i had a good time . 

 , low +2 ( -4 to +4 ) 

here goes my credibility . 

this is a film on which i expect to be in a minority . 

i liked the third jurassic park film . 

i even liked the second jurassic park film . 

in a lot of ways jurassic park : the lost world was a creative three-way braiding together of michael crichton's novel the lost world , arthur conan doyle's novel the lost world , and the classic silent film version of the doyle . 

jp2 was an adventure , as doyle said , "" for the boy who's half man or the man who's half boy . "" 

that is what all the jurassic park films are . 

expecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house . 

the classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon's mines had under-written characters also . 

jurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs . 

the characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be , and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting . 

some of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds . 

that degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require . 

i feel i got my money's worth . 

the story opens with eric ( played by trevor morgan ) and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica . 

this was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park . 

they hope , no doubt , to get a look at the island's dinosaurs from a safe height . 

the height is safe , but driving the boat in the water is not . 

the two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended . 

flash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant ( sam neill ) in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide . 

he has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs . 

but again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go . 

doing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple ( william h . macy and tea leoni ) who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs . 

they too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn . 

he will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once . 

right . 

guess what happens next ? 

jp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2 . 

first it has alan grant and ellie sattler ( laura dern ) back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm . 

sattler has a much smaller part in jp3 , but is still present to tie this story to the first . 

curiously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance . 

one thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other , suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time . 

they did not appear to be conversing in the previous films . 

of course , these raptors look a little different also , so perhaps they are a different related species . 

not only are they more intelligent than in the past films , they are also more sympathetic . 

in this story they are not just killing machines , they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition . 

this time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized . 

each new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs , of course . 

in this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus , not as common or as popularly known as a tyrannosaurus , but larger and presumably more nasty . 

it has a crocodile's head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright . 

perhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs . 

sometimes they just move too fast to see . 

occasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision . 

a few times we get unconvincing matte shot , particularly of the laboratory . 

but there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films . 

the musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williams's score for the first film . 

joe johnston , who directs , already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky . 

a team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay . 

the film they have made is a long way from great cinema , but it still is fun . 

if you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today , the film is for you . 

i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .

"one of the most blatantly obvious signs that often-acclaimed director sidney lumet's "" gloria , "" a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film , had absolutely no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre . 

suddenly , i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before , i had not thought once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in . 

when a movie is over , aren't we supposed to think about it for a while , and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with ? 

i thought so , but , for one , i saw this particular picture by myself , and #2 , even if i had been with someone there wouldn't have been anything to talk about in the first place . 

to be sure , "" gloria "" begins with a stirring , rather poignant prologue in which a seven-year-old boy's family is brutally gunned down by mobsters , in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it . 

right before the men broke in , of course , his father gave him the disc to escape with . 

eventually , the boy , named nicky nunez ( jean-luke figueroa ) , is caught by the mobsters , and taken back to their apartment . 

meanwhile , gloria ( sharon stone ) has just gotten out of prison for a crime she didn't commit and returns to her ex-boyfriend ( jeremy northam ) to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime . 

when he refuses to give it to her , and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky , she leaves with him in order to save his life , but not before holding the men at gunpoint , stealing all of their money , and forcing them to strip nude . 

gloria is the type of fast-talking , smart-mouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people , and she never expected to be stuck with a kid , but she has a heart of gold ( don't they always in this type of movie ) and is only trying to protect the boy , whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with . 

the previous incarnation of "" gloria "" by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands , remains unseen by me , but was no doubt superior , even though i can't really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one , regardless of the director or stars . 

there is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original , but the film itself is simply lifeless , with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isn't completely unbearable to watch . 

i liked , for example , a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at , and keeps turning the car around , then driving a little ways , then slamming on the brakes and turning around again . 

these bright moments , however , appear long and far between , and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria , which is both painfully predictable and by-the-numbers . 

throughout , my mind was repeatedly asking the question , "" who really cares ? "" 

as gloria , sharon stone has adopted an over-the-top brooklyn accent that honestly doesn't sound realistic at all . 

in the beginning , in fact , i was amazed at how amateurish stone's performance was , but as the film progressed she got better . 

although not one of her better turns , stone does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored . 

jean-luke figeroa was fine as nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag . 

all other actors who appeared were considerably wasted , none more than cathy moriarty , an entertaining actress in her own right , who is billed fourth and has all of one scene , as gloria's friend whom she turns to for help . 

sony , the studio that released "" gloria , "" obviously does not have any faith in the film , and i don't blame them . 

they declined to screen the picture for critics , which is never a good sign , particularly with the high-profile people involved . 

although how much money a movie makes does not determine how good it is ( just look at the spectacular "" in dreams , "" which failed to even make the top 10 last week ) , i have a suspicion "" gloria "" is going to vanish from theaters faster than "" ishtar , "" judging from the opening night 7 : 00 p . m . showing i saw it at , where there were about ten to fifteen people present , counting myself . 

although stone can be an impressive actress ( just watch her in 1995's "" casino "" or 1996's "" last dance "" if you don't believe me ) and sidney lumet can be a respectable director , there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of "" gloria "" was worth remaking or , for that matter , why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful .

"bob the happy bastard's quickie review : 

the mummy 

brendan fraser's stuck in the past again , but at least this time he has something better to do than to quote sitcom lines and try to woo alicia silverstone . . . 

fraser is the lead star of the mummy , the second directorial effort from action director stephen sommers ( who also brought us the decent thrill ride that was deep rising ) . 

it's a rough adaptation of the 1932 film , and i say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some guy in bandages , like boris karloff was engulfed in . 

but who cares , the movie has a sort of swashbuckling quality to it you can't get from , oh , say , godzilla or armageddon . 

fraser plays a soldier who gets a premonition during a battle with soldiers in an egyptian ground . 

basically , it's a little sign from the mummy buried underneath- a priest named ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part of murdering the king and making out with his mistress . 

his plan- wake back up and wake her up also , making him invincible . 

of course , fraser returns to the site years later with a librarian ( rachel weisz ) and her brother ( john hanna ) , along with a former buddy of his ( deep rising's kevin j . o'connor ) and some "" americans "" . . . and 

guess what ? 

yup , ihmoetep ( arnold vosloo ) awakens and wreaks havoc . 

fire flies from the sky , flesh-eating beetles crawl about , and , well , ihmoetep's plan begins to unfold . 

ok , so it's not really all that new a story , but the way sommers tells it is entertaining enough . 

the special effects from industrial light and magic are top notch , and the acting from fraser and weisz isn't half bad either . 

the action is pretty intense ( favorite scene : the sandstorm ) and there are a few shocking scenes just to jolt you horror-loving folks as well . 

no , it's no phantom menace beater , but if you're looking for a solid warm-up to the summer movie season , you won't find a better film under wraps than the mummy . 

if this doesn't give fraser forgiveness from blast from the past and encino man , then nothing will . 
"
"based on the boris karloff's classic by the same name , the mummy starts off with the high-priest of osiris , imhotep , who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying way possible -- bandaged up , having his tongue removed , and being covered in flesh-eating scarab beetles , then entombed . . . all while still alive . 

recap a few thousand years later , where a soldier named rick ( played by brandan fraser ) aids a young historian named evelyn ( played by rachel wiesz ) and her brother , jonathan ( played by john hannah ) in finding the book of amon ra , in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy . 

problem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress , using evelyn as a sacrifice . . . 

walking in with relatively low expectations , i thought this movie was actually pretty good . 

the visuals and cgi are astounding , and obviously not cheaply done at all . 

they pack a ton of detail into the images , especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi . 

the computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes , such as unnerving moments involving flesh-eating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him ( after all , those who took his artifacts are cursed ) . 

unfortunately , the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time , becoming a tug of war for control between genres . 

on one hand , it is a fast paced action film . 

on the other , it's a frightening horror film . 

and on the side , it's a hilarious comedy . 

ideally , for it to be successful , the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect , with one character serving as the comic relief ( that would be johnson ) . 

the problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief , with rick occasionally delivering his witty one-liner . 

if they were trying to make a horror-action-comedy , it would have helped if it were established early on in the film , but unfortunately , with the backstory of imhotep's entombment , that would be impossible . 

and then there's the slapstick fight scene between a sword-wielding rick and an army of mummies . 

while really well done , it had the feel of slapstick comedy . 

replace the sword with a chainsaw and you'd effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness . 

while entertaining and funny , it feels really out of place . 

but at least it's a break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of . 

on the whole , the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end , entertaining the audience . 

but i must end my review with a plea to movie theatre owners . . . turn 

the sound down ! 

while a lot of theatres have good sound systems , my ears were almost ringing as i walked out of the theatre ( the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap your pants if you're not careful ) . 

when they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarzenegger film , "" end of days "" , it was so loud i couldn't make anything out . 
"
"the previews for the movie are pretty good . 

they show a little plot , all the characters , and the emotional highlights , all spliced together to give a general impression of the script . 

unfortunately , the full movie adds nothing but 115 minutes . 

the residents of mystery love hockey . 

mystery and hockey go together like texas and high school football . 

the townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acquit a player who's guilty of shooting another man ( yes , that's one of the movie's jokes . ) 

every saturday , the best players pair off for a game , and the whole town comes to watch . 

the town's prodigal son charlie ( hank azaria ) wrote an article on the weekly game for sports illustrated . 

mystery's national fame has the town abuzz . 

a week later , charlie actually shows up in person , and he brings with him an offer from the nhl . 

the new york rangers will come to mystery to play the locals . 

the mysterians see this as both good and bad . 

on the one hand , they'd love to have the fame and the money of such an exhibition . 

on the other hand , they don't want to turn up as the butt of leno and letterman jokes . 

the movie follows a handful of lives that are affected by the proposition . 

biebe ( russell crowe ) has just been retired from the team and is asked to coach the boys , including his new replacement . 

he's already resentful , and to top it off charlie has been making eyes at his wife . 

crowe is not given a lot of room to act in this film , so he's just kind of stuck with constantly brooding . 

charlie , meanwhile , is resentful of having born in a town where hockey is the only measure of a man's worth . 

his "" gift "" of the feature story , and of the new york rangers , was his way of compensating for not being a better skater . 

he hoped it would earn him some respect and merit , but the townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him . 

burt reynolds could have been interesting as walter , the judge whose courtroom was befouled by a moronic jury of hockey fans . 

walter actually has some experience with collegiate hockey , but he actively tries to put it behind him . 

he wants his son to take the game more seriously , but he wants his community to just get over it . 

reynolds could have been good , but sloppy writing and/or editing keep walter in the corner , and so reynolds never really gets to pull his performance all together . 

one character actually was interesting . 

biebe's wife ( mary mccormack ) , like the judge , understood that there was more to life than hockey . 

but unlike him she has come to accept the skewed view of the community . 

she chose the town and her husband with her eyes wide open . 

her unique insight is verbalized once , and it lasts only a scene before it is gone , but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom . 

mysterty , alaska follows a handful of other characters , but none are well developed or worth mentioning . 

the biggest problem with this movie is that there is no real heart to the story , no underlying thing that the movie is really about . 

instead , roach and screenwriters david e . kelley and sean o'byrne try to cram the entire human condition into this sports comedy . 

they try to make you laugh and cry , to feel outrage and pride . 

they present the framing and cadence for jokes , but there's nothing truly funny . 

they show appropriately staged scenes of sadness , but they give you nothing to be really sad about . 

as columnist molly ivins would say , it's all hat , no cattle . 

the perfect opportunity arises for roach to say what this movie is really about . 

there is a funeral scene , played with appropriate gravity and somber music . 

it is a chance for the characters to reflect on their lives and decide what's truly important . 

russell crowe steps forward to speak , about to spell out the movie's metaphor for us . 

he says that what really matters in life is "" community . . . . "" 

then adds "" and hockey . "" 

i guess these mysterians really are as shallow as they appear . 

only mildly bad , mystery , alaska probably deserves 2 stars . 

i even laughed out loud , genuine laughs in places . 

but i docked it an extra half star when mike myers , a friend of roach , turned up in a role that didn't suit him . 

myers is a comic character actor . 

he puts on masks , becomes an outrageous caricature , and is funny . 

he's great as austin powers , dr . evil , or any of his scottish characters . 

nobody else in mysterty , alaska is a comic caricature . 

all the other people have the feel of dramatic characters in semi-serious roles . 

for roach to bring in myers for a few cheap laughs shows incredible contempt toward the rest of his cast , toward his audience , and indeed toward the film itself . 

it's an acknowledgment by the director that the film is not worth taking seriously . 
"
"last summer , a feature-length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning . 

based on the famous 60's television show , the film was an enormous box-office flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros . a year later , the studio is up to their old tricks again , with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild , wild west . 

but it sounded promising : the same tag-team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success , is at the reins again . 

and co-star kevin kline is attached to the project , as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects . 

i mean , what could possibly go wrong ? 

the answer is just about everything . 

wild wild west is a cinematic abomination - a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate . 

there are a lot of fancy special effects , and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression . 

but the script is so deliriously uneven , the entire movie so off course , that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it . 

at square one , we have a bizarre case of casting . 

will smith plays james west , a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series . 

my guess regarding the casting of african-american smith is a simple one : the actor + a cozy summertime release = big bucks for all those involved . 

smith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material , but this is not an ideal role for him . 

he's too much of a joker . 

i heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role , and frankly , that sounds a lot more plausible . 

what makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such self-assurance in his eyes ; you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office . 

the plot involves west and cross-dressing government agent artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists . 

the trail leads to the diabolical dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry , witty southern accent . 

loveless has taken the country's top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control , using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns . 

one such weapon is an 80-foot mechanical tarantula , bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right . 

the visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular , seamlessly blending computer-generated imagery with the western surroundings . 

unfortunately , all of these effects seem so detached from the story , and can do little to support the film's plot deficiencies , which are undoubtedly the main problem . 

wild wild west is a running gag that never truly works . 

most of the jokes , usually care of smith , die on arrival . 

if it's one thing that could possibly be the saving grace , it's the performances , and even they are mostly off-kilter and poorly delivered . 

kline is admirable , but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot . 

salma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest , because she is viewed as little more than that - window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon . 

branagh , an esteemed shakespearean actor and director , adds marginal enjoyment to the film . 

but even he is so utterly weird and over-the-top . 

rarely is a film so lost in itself as wild wild west is . 

i suppose there's always one turkey of the summer season ; a highly anticipated , big-budget release that manages to completely disappoint . 

wild wild west is such a movie , and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999 . 

but it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office . 

perhaps after this , audiences will be less assured when they see will smith's name stamped on a summer movie . 

after such hits as independence day and mib , wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume . 
"
"in the first death wish movie , mild-mannered new york architect paul kersey , played by charles bronson , was avenging the death of his wife . 

in the second , he was avenging his daughter . 

in the third , he instigated small war in order to avenge the old friend . 

fourth movie , on the other hand , begins with kersey doubting the point of his violent crusades and living the quiet life with his girlfriend karen , played by kay lenz . 

however , since this is death wish movie , we know that sooner or later something bad is going to happen to the people kersey cares for . 

this time karen's teenage daughter dies of a crack overdose and kersey is forced to return to his old vigilante ways . 

kersey's new targets , unlike the previous movies , aren't the ordinary street punks but rich , heavily armed and well-connected drug dealers . 

even such unstoppable killing machine like kersey needs some support , and it comes from the publisher nathan white ( john p . ryan ) , determined to avenge the drug-related death of his own daughter . 

white's plan is to make kersey kill major players in two rival drug dealing organisations and thus instigate the war between them . 

the plan begins to take shape , but kersey's actions bring attention of two police detectives - reiner ( george dickerson ) and nozaki ( soon teck-oh ) . 

fourth ( and , unfortunately , not the final ) installment in the death wish series , will probably remembered as the typical movie of cannon group , production company responsible for some of the worst cinematic trash of the last decade . 

however , although some critics might argue , death wish 4 : the crackdown represents slight improvement over the death wish 3 . paul kersey , one of the most intriguing ( and potentially controversial ) characters of the 1970s , is still being dumbed down by mediocre script , and charles bronson really doesn't feel the need to put much effort in his acting . 

however , the hand of a veteran director j . lee thompson seems more capable of michael winner's and the action scenes seem slightly less surreal , although they still look cheap and repetitive and downright boring . 

there are some attempts for the movie to have a plot between the numerous scenes of violence , and one of such attempts is a potentially interesting plot twist at the end . 

the script even tries to fake some social conscience ( through criminally underused kay lenz's character ) and predates the war on drugs campaign that would inspire many hollywood products in next few years . 

there are even some half-hearted attempts of humour - both intentional and unintentional , like in a scene where kersey assassinates mob figures by a wine bottle - but the quality of this movie is still far away from bronson's 1970s classics . 

 ( special note to x-philes : mith pilleggi , the actor who plays ad skinner in the x- files , could be seen in a small role of cannery lab foreman ) .

"talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters ! 

spice world is the feature film debut of the pre-fabricated pop band , the spice girls . 

it's intended as a sort of hard day's night , but ends up simply hard to watch . 

when watching the spice girls , i'm reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick ( such as from the smurfs , the snorks , or teenage mutant ninja turtles ) in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name . 

the spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles , and about as talented . 

there's ginger ( geri halliwell ) , the brainy one , sporty ( melanie chisholm ) , the athletic one , baby ( emma bunton ) , the childish one , posh ( victoria adams ) , the fashion-conscious one , and scary ( melanie brown ) , the one with a tongue pierced back so far you're almost certain the post sticks out her throat . 

the film itself doesn't really have a plot . 

it follows the girls as they travel here and there , culminating at their "" first live performance "" at albert hall . 

the action , however , seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas . 

the various misfires include : an alien encounter , a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls , the shooting of a spice girls documentary , a movie producer ( george wendt ) trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie ( nearly all of which , though incredibly far fetched , seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up ) , a meeting with a pregnant friend ( whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends ) , a boating adventure , a bus race , club-hopping ( wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd . . . even 

when they start to sing ) , and an assorted number of musical performances , press conferences , and general all-around celebrity stuff . 

whew . 

for some reason , the film is littered with star cameos . 

from elton john to elvis costello , from bob hoskins to meat loaf . 

heck , even roger moore shows up , though he can't decide if he's parodying himself as james bond , or if he's lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld . 

richard e . grant has the largest secondary part , a thankless role of the band's manager , clifford . 

the celebrity spotting is partially amusing , and a decent way to pass the time when confronted with the rest of the film . 

neither amusing or spontaneous , when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring . 

their songs are alright , but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos . 

my advice to fans is : stay home and watch that video collection , or at least spin that cd a couple of more times . . . either 

option will be more enjoyable than the film . 

non-fans should know to stay well away from this one .

"don't let this movie fool you into believing the romantic noirs of william shakespeare . 

no one will truly understand the heart and soul of this man except through his work , and this movie makes a vain attempt at that . 

any moves to ? glamorise' his life , which hollywood has an annoying tendency to do , will only subtract from his achievement rather than expound on his greatness . 

this movie about his life , although well written , puts too much make-up on a man whose life was probably more pork and potatoes , rather than lobster and champagne . 

oh well , let's fantasise onwards an assume that he was a bit of a flirtatious play-write , who falls in love with a beautiful woman ( gwyneth paltrow ) and from her inspiration , several plays develop - ? romeo and juliet' , and ? the twelfth night' . 

it is easier for me to believe that he had a wet dream and that's how all his plays develop , but please spare me all of this unnecessary melodrama . 

but i guess my version probably wouldn't draw a crowd or make a dollar on screen . 

so is there any justification in romanticising the man shakespeare , when all we need to do is read his work in order to find his soul . 

i think not . 

as for the oscars were they deserved by this movie ? 

i think not . 

in many aspects ? private ryan' and ? life is beautiful' were far superior movies , but one should never assume that this should be a criteria for winning an oscar , as time and again , for reasons unexplained , an undeserving movie will win the accolade . 

another sore point is the fact that gwyneth won the best female lead , over a more polished cate , but i guess if you go on enough about your grandfather dying and your nephew being hospitalised - people will start feeling sorry for you .

"wild things is a way to steam up an otherwise dreary early spring day ? provided , of course , that you're the victim of a frontal lobotomy . 

there is , in fact , no doubt about who this motion picture is aimed at : movie-goers in their late teens and early twenties -- the most lucrative target group . 

this is film noir for the mtv generation : fast-paced , slick , flashy , gleefully mindless , and hollow to the core . 

wild things is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during the first eleven weeks of 1998 . 

i've seen more convincing drama ( with nearly as much bare flesh ) on that pinnacle of narrative quality , baywatch . 

wild things wants to dupe viewers into thinking it's a thriller with a real story . 

what it is , however , is a series of increasingly- improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists . 

everything in between those serpentine moments is filler -- a flash of a breast , a spatter of blood , and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side of a steven seagal movie . 

the film tries so hard to surprise its audience that the twists end up being easy to guess -- just take a stab at the most unlikely thing to happen , and that will probably be it . 

using this approach , i was right three times and wrong only once . 

that's not a good average for a production that wants to keep viewers in the dark about what's around the next corner . 

the ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie : the hot , young cast and the old standby , sex . 

both have an abundance of screen time , although i'll admit that the film's erotic content is somewhat less impressive than i expected . 

nothing about wild things is exceptionally risqu ? . 

the soft-core sex sequences are generic , and don't generate much heat . 

the lesbian kisses can't hold a candle to those in bound . 

theresa russell and denise richards have only token topless appearances ( neve campbell , possessing an iron-clad "" no nudity "" clause in her contract , keeps her clothes more or less on ) . 

the film's greatest curiosity is a full frontal shot of kevin bacon climbing out of the shower . 

maybe a few girls will skip seeing a fully-clothed leonardo dicaprio for the thirteenth time in titanic to catch a glimpse of what kyra sedgwick ( mrs . 

kevin bacon ) is familiar with . 

the director of wild things is john mcnaughton , whose last effort was the finely-tuned psychological thriller , normal life . 

that movie featured copious sex , a pair of real characters , and a powerful script . 

it's difficult to believe that something this shallow could come from the same film maker . 

but i suppose we all need to put food on the table . 

mcnaughton appears to have completely lost his way here , in what is obviously a stab at mainstream success ( his previous wide-release picture , mad dog and glory , was a box-office disappointment ) . 

quick cuts and pretty sunrises can't even begin to cover up this movie's flaws . 

the main character ( and i use that term lightly , since no one in wild things shows more than an occasional flash of personality ) is sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a guidance counselor at florida's blue bay high school . 

a student , the deliciously curvaceous kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , has a crush on him . 

one afternoon , she comes to his house to wash his car , and , when she leaves , her clothing is torn . 

after confessing to her mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped , she goes to the police station , where she tells her story to detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) . 

they are skeptical about here claims until another girl , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , comes forward with a similar tale . 

meanwhile , sam , convinced that he's being set up , goes to a shyster lawyer ( bill murray ) for help . 

the acting in wild things isn't very good , but none of the principals have much to work with . 

this is definitely not a character- based motion picture . 

not only does the ludicrous screenplay ignore the possibility that someone in the audience may have a triple-digit i . q . , but it doesn't bother to give any of the on-screen individuals even a hint of depth . 

the men and women populating the picture are there to look nice , but nothing more . 

matt dillon is given plenty of opportunities to flex his biceps . 

neve campbell gets to model the slutty look . 

denise richards strikes a fetching pose in a see-through , one-piece bathing suit . 

and nothing in the film gets a rise out of kevin bacon . 

the only one who's even remotely interesting is bill murray , and he seems to think he's in comedy , not a thriller ( maybe he's got the right idea ) . 

columbia pictures has specifically requested that critics not reveal the film's ending , which prompts the question : which ending do they want kept secret ? 

wild things has no less than three ( one occurs during the end credits , so stay seated ) , all of which are jaw-droppingly absurd -- a feat that joe eszterhas ( the writer of basic instinct and showgirls ) would be impressed by . 

thanks to jeffrey kimball's polished , kinetic cinematography , wild things always looks great , and george s . clinton's score keeps it pulsing and throbbing . 

but , no matter how shiny the superficial sheen is , this is still trash , and , like all garbage , it stinks . 
"
"let me open this one with a confession : i love cop movies . 

i adore them with such an unwavering , near foolish passion that i was actually one of the first in line to see 1998's one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brothers , steven . 

was it any good ? 

well , just about as good as baldwin's steven seagal impression ( for those i've confused the answer is a resounding no ! ) . 

now let me clarify , i don't love just any cop movie ; i'm not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80's and now slowly ( gulp ) returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker . 

i'm partial to those gritty , earthy cop dramas like serpico , donnie brasco , and the french connection . 

problem is these films come along just about as often as george w . bush makes a cogent point so whenever a "" true "" cop movie does hit multiplexes , i come running towards it like an eager puppy ? ? ? and inevitably i leave , head bowed , tripping over my squiggly tail . 

so what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out $7 . 50 for a movie called one tough cop ( which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spin-off , no ? ) ? 

truth is i'm a sucker for those barren streets , that gritty , graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops , like modern day knights , must shield us from their iniquitous clutches . 

yes it's all very corny and awfully boys clubish , which , i'm guessing , is precisely where these feelings come from . 

as little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joe's , enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies , etc . the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies , and heighten them , turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos . 

as an adult my tastes haven't changed all that drastically ; sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film , but i still delight at the promise a "" guy "" film could potentially bring . 

now what if it's the cops who're the corrupt ones ? 

ooh that one really gets me going , these protectors using all that at their service , taking advantage of others for their own gain . 

throw a courtroom drama ( yech ! ) 

into the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city . 

how absorbing is prince of the city , you ask ? 

so damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama ( a sub-genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar ) i remained completely and utterly involved . 

the film stars treat williams , who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at . 

since i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city , i cannot provide an answer as to why it didn't . 

 ( though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves ) . 

like mickey rourke and eric roberts ( both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory ) williams is a talented leading man who didn't make it to where he should have . 

 ( if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell ) . 

here , the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacino's in serpico ( also directed by lumet ) . 

williams plays danny ciello , a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty pre-juliani streets of new york . 

they work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes . 

and that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done . 

the squad relies entirely on informants ( low level junkies ) to gain access to the big wigs , and in order to obtain the info they seek , they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice . 

danny has done this , and though he's a fairly honorable guy , who took the job in order to do good , his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way . 

he seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as a "" double agent "" . 

he does so with one condition : he will not rat on his partners . 

right away we know that that is exactly what he'll have to do . 

and watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be . 

undercover cop films are almost innately exciting , even the kind that pull out all the cliches ( like in too deep ) . 

how can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal , ambiguity , and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position ? 

prince of the city takes all this and charges it with a perceptive , hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet , as well as a handful of intense performances , most notably by treat . 

lumet's greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back , and lets the camera soak up the action . 

his scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension , and he rarely holds for reaction shots , instead he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking . 

lumet's worst tendency is one that many film makers ( especially oliver stone ) tend to overuse : he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension . 

this isn't as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan , lumet's most recent cop \ lawyer endeavor , a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching . 

though of late lumet has made several really awful career choices ( maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something ) , the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria , here he was on , sustaining tension in a film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot . 

some of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic . 

hollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable . 

of course cop movies aren't popular anymore ( yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines ) , but just look at the average hollywood action movies , flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn't gay , the lame comic relief character who's never funny , and on and on . 

for all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is a back to the basics cop \ courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills . 

it focuses completely on its story , and its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies . 

there's a great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if he's about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches , but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and begins sobbing . 

this is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film ( even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon , not one damn tear ) it would be cut out because the director would say oh that makes him too human , excuse me , weak . 

in the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness , straining to get the words out . 

he's lost his voice . 

does that little itty bitty detail matter ? 

maybe not to most , but it sure made my night . 

and in a sprawling epic of corruption , greed , betrayal and violence it's nice to see that someone is paying attention to the little things .

"dora ( fernanda montenegro ) sits behind a make-shift desk at rio+s major train station .

she+s quirky , she+s elderly , she+s caring . 

totally trustworthy , right ?

shortly thereafter , she gets hit by a bus , and the son is orphaned . 

days go by , and the boy , named josu ? , roams around the station , hungry , desperate , and somewhat clueless to his predictament . 

through a series of circumstances too precious to elaborate upon , dora somehow takes a responsibility in trying to find josu ? +s father . 

this means leaving the security of rio , traveling to the outskirts of brazil , where unpaved roads , religious devotees and the poverty-stricken become commonplace . 

films like this remind me as to what i enjoy about some foreign films .

the focus is on the minute transformation of dora , of how she learns to love this little kid , without being cloying or sentimental . 

the most interesting backdrop is the amount of religious dedication is in the film . 

dora being an amoral scam-artist , could care less about the amount of bickering between the candle-lighting of the catholics versus the bumper-sticker mentality of the evangelicals . 

but neither side is trivialized . 

she even begins to develop an affection for a non-drinking evangelical , who sees the problems with dora , if not initially .

" "" marie couldn't talk , "" paulie , the parrot star of his own movie , tells us about the daughter in his original family . 

 "" dad couldn't listen . 

and mom couldn't cope , so they got rid of me . "" 

paulie , the autobiography of a talking , not merely a mimicking , parrot , has jay mohr in the lead role of the bird - the voice , not the body - and as the minor character of benny , a small-time crook who uses paulie to pull off small scams like stealing twenties from atms . 

as the parrot , mohr is delightful when director john roberts allows him to cut up . 

benny , on the other hand , is a character you've seen a thousand times before , and mohr brings nothing new to that role . 

roberts's deliberately slow pacing of laurie craig's script lends a subtle sweetness to its humor but creates some definite problems . 

when a kids' movie wants to mosey along , watch out . 

if the material is not crisp and perfectly composed , beauty can sometimes dissolve into tedium . 

so it is with paulie . 

when they let their bird do his stand-up comedy routines , the show hums and the audience roars . 

too often , however , a sleepy silence ensues among the viewers as they wait for the story to pickup again . 

tony shalhoub , the smart-mouthed chef from big night , plays misha , a recent russian immigrant to the u . s . he had been a teacher of literature at home , but now he makes his living as a janitor in the animal research lab to which paulie has been taken for study . 

although misha gets a few nice lines ( "" i'm russian . 

i like long stories . "" ) , 

his somber part seems designed only to elicit our sympathy . 

besides paulie , the only character worth noting - other than 2 cute small parts played by cheech marin and gina rowlands - is the speech-impaired marie , played in a precious performance by cinematic newcomer , 5-year-old hallie kate eisenberg . 

naturally enchanting , she gives the picture genuine heart . 

the bad news is that her part is confined to the first half . 

the best scenes have the bird dancing and strutting to show off his comedic skills . 

when marie's family gets a cat , for example , the bird , who hasn't wanted to learn how to fly until then , takes an instant interest in soaring . 

tricking the cat while insulting him at the same time , paulie calls him a stupid hairball . 

their rapid physical antics add to the humor of the situation . 

it's good quality sitcom material but performed by animals . 

when one of the humans without much of a voice begins to sing , paulie cringes . 

 "" i'm a bird , "" he explains with his frequently subtle humor . 

 "" i have a small brain , and it's about to explode . "" 

the movie contains rich doses of john debney's dreamy music . 

with heavy use of a solo violin , he keeps reinforcing the film's heart-warming themes . 

and when paulie finally takes off in flight , the orchestra comes up loud and strong with cymbals clashing . 

 "" it's a long story , "" says paulie . 

 "" it's the only kind he knows , "" reflects misha . 

and the motion picture , which runs the standard length for a kids' movie , still feels too long . 

the best parts are enthralling , but then there are all of those dead spots in-between . 

paulie is a movie that never quite lives up to its promise but manages to charm nevertheless . 

paulie runs 1 : 32 . 

it is raged pg for a few mild profanities and would be fine for all ages . 

my son , jeffrey , age 9 , gave the movie * * with his biggest complaint being that there wasn't enough action . 

he thought paulie was funny , and the actress that played marie was quite good . 

his friend sam , almost 9 , thought the movie was "" awesome , excellent , "" and gave it * * * * . 

he thought paulie was good , but he didn't believe the way marie's speech impediment was acted .

"in the grand scheme of mel gibson movies , payback was better than conspiracy theory , but not as good as braveheart or lethal weapon . 

in other words , it's a decent couple of hours of entertainment , but 20 years from now if a they compile a list of mel gibson's greatest hits , payback probably won't be on it . 

gibson plays a crook who gets double crossed by his partner after they heist a payroll . 

mel's partner needed the money to pay off a mob debt . 

so he puts a couple of bullets in mel , leaving him for dead , and goes on to pay off his creditors . 

but , mel isn't dead ( it would be a real short movie if he was ) and he certainly isn't happy . 

to make matters worse , he wants his money back and is willing to go to any lengths to accomplish this feat . 

his ex partner has already used it to pay off the mobsters , so mel goes after the mob to get it back . 

payback is often a very violent film . 

to its credit , there are a few scenes that could have been very graphic , but the director ( i'm not sure which one -- more about that in a second ) made the choice to let the audience use their imagination instead of subjecting us to the usual gratuitous gore found in many films . 

the film appears a bit disjointed in places , which is understandable considering producer / star gibson wasn't thrilled with how the film turned out and wanted parts of it re-shot . 

when the director refused , another one was brought in to do the re-shoot . 

so as a result while the final product is apparently better than the original ( although personally i would love to see the original version for comparisons sake ) it does get a bit of a choppy feel to it towards the end . 

it's always tough to make a film where the main character is a villain , unless that person has some redeeming qualities . 

in this case , gibson's character has few redeeming qualities . 

but hey , its mel , so even when he is killing people in cold blood we are still rooting for him . 

my guess is that if that you put some other johnny bananas actor in this role , the audience would not be quite as responsive . 

gibson is gibson , whether he is playing a suicidal cop or a stone cold killer , he does a good job . 

he almost guarantees that no matter what else happens in the rest of the movie at least the audience is going to get one good performance . 

this time out mel is surrounded by a good supporting cast , including maria bello ( as his love interest ) , william devane and kris kristofferson ( as mod bosses ) . 

the man who steals the show and unfortunately doesn't have a real big part is james coburn ( as yet another mobster ) . 

if i had one big disappointment in this film , it would be that coburn didn't have a bigger role . 

in the end , payback is a fairly solid action thriller , just not in quite the same league as some of mel gibson's other work .

"robin williams is a comedic genus . 

that is , he is one when he's in a film that allows him space to move . 

 "" flubber "" straps him in a straitjacket , covers him with duct tape , stuffs him in a coat closet and piles furniture against the door to make sure that he doesn't get out . 

in a re-make of its own 1961 "" absent minded professor "" , disney offers us proof that more is definitely less . 

recycling old films ( "" that darned cat "" , "" 101 dalmatians "" ) dressed up as new is the newest money machine from the home of the mouse that roared . 

professor phillip brainard ( williams ) is a terminally forgetful scientist teaching at a small college . 

his fiancee , sara jean reynolds ( marcia gay harden ) , president of the college is none too happy with him because he's left her waiting at the altar due to his lack of short-term -- and long-term -- memory . 

she's giving him one more chance . 

he blows that chance when he invents "" flubber "" ( flying rubber ) and is so excited by his discovery that sara jean is once again awaiting him in her white dress . 

his tardiness is helped along by his jealous flying robotic assistant who wants him all to herself . 

it's not all bad news . 

flubber is a green jello that can magnify and reflect energy that is applied to it . 

brainard realizes the commercial potential within the goo can save the school from bankruptcy and being taken over by the town's evil industrialist charles hoenicker ( raymond barry ) . 

while he's busy with his new breakthrough , the slighted sweetheart is being wooed by his sleazy rival wilson croft ( christopher mcdonald ) . 

there's a flying car , flubber-enhanced basketball game and an assortment of broken lab equipment : none of which are the least bit interesting or funny . 

at one point , my son looked around the audience and asked "" why are these people laughing ? "" 

although williams turns in one of his least inspired roles , he is easily the most lively of the actors . 

everyone else comes across as half-asleep . 

the re-make is successful in that respect . 

it feels like a bad disney movie from the sixties . 

i remember the original as being charming , but my guess is that the memory from almost four decades ago has been artificially enhanced by the years . 

there have been some updates . 

fred macmurray's flying model t has been replaced by a t-bird . 

his faithful dog charlie is now "" weebo "" , the hovering robot . 

the biggest change is that , with sophisticated computer animation , we now can have films show off special effects without being at all entertaining . 

flubber is anthropomorphized into a being supposedly with personality . 

the gloop has little arms and legs and splits into tiny little gloopettes for a big dance number . 

this has nothing to do with the story . 

the only possible reason is to create merchandising opportunities so that kids can badger their parents into taking them to mcdonalds for the toys . 

not that contributing little to the plot is a big problem . 

there are very few aspects of the film that move the story and those that do don't make sense . 

the discovery of flubber is going to save the college because brainard can sell his flying car to ford . 

anyone with half a brain would be able to see that his intelligent flying automaton is worth billions . 

it's unbelievable that his lover ( well , probably not a lover -- after all this is disney ) starts dating croft after the aborted wedding . 

there's not one appealing component of this man . 

after the professor discovers that smearing a golf ball with the gunk causes it to bounce uncontrollably around his lab wreaking havoc , i cringed as he picked up a bowling ball . 

this guy is beyond forgetful , venturing into the certifiable . 

co-writer john hughes used to direct light-weight but thoughtful teen films . 

the care behind "" pretty in pink "" and "" the breakfast club "" all went out the window after his "" home alone "" franchise heated up the box offices . 

looking much like "" home alone 3 1/2 "" , "" flubber "" even features a couple of vapid goons who get banged around and a cute little boy who screams a lot . 

in some ways , it's difficult to judge this film . 

i have a suspicion that i'm not it's target audience . 

after all , i measure my age in two digits .

"warner brothers has scored another marketing coup . 

the one-two punch was started in the summer , with the release of batman forever . 

trailers for ace ventura 2 were bundled with the bat , ensuring that every jim carrey fan in the free world would know about the impending sequel . 

carrey went on to win raves as the riddler and the ever-wise warner chose halloween as the release date for the video ( $11 . 99 at wal-mart ) ; a mere two weeks before carrey's return in this marketwise , but misfired comedy . 

ace ventura : when nature calls is a painful reminder of just how grating the rubber-faced comic can be when allowed to perform within an uncontrolled environment . 

he may have been brilliant under the direction of joel schumacher , in batman forever , but , here , left to his own devices , carrey quickly wears out his welcome . 

the opening sequence is by far the best--an amusing spoof of cliffhanger , with ace performing a mountain rescue of a stranded raccoon . 

 ( you can guess what happens to mr . paws . 

hint : it sounds like splat . ) 

the plot quickly shifts to a temple in the himalayas , and then to not-so-darkest africa , where ace is on the case of a missing white bat . 

with his hair and limbs both wildly askew , carrey flies through his routine in about thirty minutes . 

the rest of the film is just more of the same . 

sure , the plot's linear , and the production values solid , but where is the scripted humor to support carrey's sloppy slathering ? 

writer and director steve oderkerk provides precious few set-ups . 

instead , carrey just mugs away , playing for the camera even when most of it isn't funny . 

the better gags have been shown in the ads , though a bit with ace emerging buck-naked from the backside of a mechanical rhino is something to see . 

though an arguable improvement over the original , ace ventura : when nature calls is still a snooze for anyone over the age of ten . 

the script is virtually devoid of wit . 

tribal mask jokes ? 

jerry lewis cameos ? 

forget it . 

if anything , the inexplicable presence of simon callow ( four weddings and a funeral ) and bob gunton ( the shawshank redemption ) suggests that working with carrey is the classical actor's ultimate challenge . 

just how long * can * they keep a straight face ?

"the last line ( or near to that honor ) is the great butler , alfred ( the ubergod , michael gough ) saying , "" i think we need a bigger bat cave , "" or something to that note .

cut batgirl out .

it's so much that characters get left behind . 

poor elle gets a mere 3 scenes and a subplot which is introduced but never finished in any way , shape or form . 

and elle deserves better . 

this is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher . 

it's also the fourth worst in the series ( and second worst from joel ) . 

the series has been declining since its stunning debut , followed by the almost-as-stunning sequel and then the anti-climactic third one ( first by joel ) . 

this one's not anti-climactic - i knew it was gonna suck . 

it's up to joel to make it fun though . 

 "" batman forever "" was fun . 

this is a big bore of over-produced action sequences and shallow characters . 

i mean , this one bit . 

i'm gonna put all the plot in one paragraph : mr . freeze ( ah-nold ) , who's wife was dying of some disease , has become the new big villain these days . 

he's a huge ex-scientist who fell into some weird liquid ( hello ? 

joker ? ) and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero and has a blue body . 

batman ( george ) and robin ( chris ) fight him a bit but find they're growing apart . 

meanwhile , another villain shows up , poison ivy ( uma ! ) , who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist ( john glover ) who kills her when she finds out he's used her research to develop an uberman , bane , who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had . 

she emerges from her chemicals ( don't ask 'cause i can't tell ya ) as a sexy woman ( the real uma ) who's poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people . 

she starts to tear away at the dynamic duo . 

meanwhile , alfred's dying of the same disease mr . freeze's wife has ( but in an earlier state than she ) , and his niece , barbara ( alicia ) , comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade , but soon ( well , not really soon , it takes her 2 hours ) becomes batgirl . 

meanwhile , in an unfinished subplot , bruce ( batman's alter-ego , if you forgot ) has been dating the lovely julie madison ( the even lovlier elle macpherson ) who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing . 

end of her for all we know . 

mr . freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population ( don't ask ! ! ! ) . 

the trio must team together "" as family "" to beat them . 

there ya go . 

not the whole story but no big context clues . 

too much , right ? 

right ! 

the films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels . 

however , while tim burton nicely balanced the villain/batman storyline ( although not wonderfully ) , joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one . 

he gets some corny speeches , a couple clever lines and that's it . 

maybe some stunts . 

for all this , i can't even comment on george clooney as batman - i hardly saw the guy ! 

and when i did , he had horrible dialogue to say . 

i think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode . 

george is in between them . 

he's not quintessential , he's not horrible , he's good . 

but i'm sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they'll be critically murdered for this sorry effort , we'll get a good script and clooney will shine ( if he still has the job ) . 

the villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher . 

last time , we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brains/comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey . 

this time we have a somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain ( the same guy ) , mr . freeze . 

we feel bad for his mental/physical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants ? 

arnold isn't very good - too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points . 

when he watches old movies of his wife , he actually looks somber . 

wow . 

but uma makes the most of her seductive character , getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness . 

it's like she's almost parodying herself in "" pulp fiction "" at points . 

she's incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much a star better . 

as for the lower bat-people , chris is the same as he was in "" batman forever , "" although i think his work in these is too hokey when he's best at quieter parts in "" scent of a woman "" or just plain cool parts in "" fried green tomotoes . "" 

alicia - i love the girl but she's not particularly good in this film . 

she can hypotheitically act , we all saw that in "" clueless , "" but her lines kinda sound weird . 

and it isn't the mushy-mouth this time . 

but in all fairness , she has virtually no part . 

joel gets around to her occasionally and when she's on , she does stupid stuff . . . although 

i know i'm not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma . . . 

and poor elle . 

poor , poor elle . 

i love that woman and she can also hypothetically act ( for those of us who saw "" sirens "" ) . 

but she has no part ! ! ! 

it seems like joel had so much footage that he had to edit almost an hour out of the final product . 

there are no "" couch "" scenes ( like my best friend noticed ) . 

now listen to me on this one - in every "" batman "" flick , there's a couch scene . 

in the original , it was with vicki . 

in "" returns , "" it was a good make-out scene with selena . 

and in the last one , it was a chat with nicole . 

this one , it's nothing . 

and batgirl does next-to-nothing in this film till the end when she's suddenly "" part of the family . "" 

fortunately , we get a lot of alfred . 

he's the always reliable butler , in case you didn't know , who has been with bruce all his life . 

he's a god . 

he's a father figure . 

he's also dying . 

this got to me . 

i love alfred almost as much as bruce and to see him in a robe , not in his tux , and freaking dying just gets to me . 

we also get the idea that he might have been unhappy the whole time . . . but 

this is never answered , as this film is too cluttered . 

but in defense , it does have some good parts , other than uma . 

for one , george is a good batman but unfortunately gets nothing to do . 

and there are some nice touches . 

when they show the asylum at one point , they show the patient's belongings in a room and we see the riddler's costume . 

i laughed . 

and during a biker scene ( involving robin and batgirl - another subplot never handled past initiation period ) , we not only see coolio but a bunch of bad-asses dressed as "" droogs "" from "" a clockwork orange . "" 

i laughed at all these . 

the film falls apart around the five-minute mark during an enormously long action sequence which must last around 20 minutes . . . or 

did it just feel like that ? 

the film should serve as another in the long-line of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays . 

people are fed up with stupid films . 

that's why the word of mouth killed "" the lost world ! "" 

that's why last year , indy films grossed more than ever . 

that's why this will have a strong box-office initative from people who just want to see it , like me , but will die after a week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it . 

that's why the next two big-budget aciton pics are john woo's "" face/off "" and barry sonnenfeld's "" men in black , "" both which are the first two to catch on to the wave early on . 

i like joel schumacher more as a person than an artiste . 

i like some of his films ( "" flatliners , "" "" a time to kill "" ) but a lot of them suck . 

he's a really eccentric person and i loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being a mediocre director and that's what makes him great . 

but his costuming for woody allen's "" sleeper "" was more interesting than this one ( and his costuming was cool - look for the nazi number ) . 

i love the "" batman "" series . 

the first two rocked and i did like the last one . 

but this one is not going to be one that i watch repeatedly like the other three . 

hopefully , this will also serve as a springboard to a better batman next time . 

and maybe they'll get smart and bring back catwoman . 

and michael keaton . 

but we can only hope .

"the real blonde ( r ) a woman's face , an arm , some pumped-up pectorals , blond hair , a man's sad face , slender legs , a random hand here and there . 

as the opening credits of tom dicillo's the real blonde unfold , these scattered , fractured glimpses eventually come together to form the image of a bikini brief-clad man on his knees clinging to a nurturing woman , his head concealing her unclothed breasts . 

if only the rest of this formless , aimless ensemble comedy assembled so coherently . 

joe ( matthew modine ) is a waiter/struggling actor too proud to take gigs in commercials or soap operas . 

he's feeling somewhat dissatisfied with his relationship with his live-in love , mary ( catherine keener ) , who holds some subconscious hostility toward the male gender . 

mary , a makeup artist , regularly works on model sahara ( bridgette wilson ) , who is obsessed with the underlying messages in disney's the little mermaid . 

the bottle blonde has a turbulent on-again , off-again relationship with bob ( maxwell caulfield ) , a soap actor who yearns for the taste of a real blonde , which he finds in co-star kelly ( daryl hannah ) . 

as the film unspools , a variety of other characters pass through : fashion photographer blair ( marlo thomas ) ; mary's shrink ( buck henry ) and self-defense instructor ( denis leary ) ; joe's casting agent ( kathleen turner ) and hardass boss ( christopher lloyd ) ; and a mystery woman ( elizabeth berkley ) who keeps on crossing joe's path . 

where exactly does all this go ? 

that's a question best posed to writer-director dicillo , who doesn't appear to have the slightest clue himself . 

his meandering , largely unfunny script and direction are like hopelessly lost drivers , turning into dead-end narrative streets only to reverse course and hit another creative cul-de-sac . 

and another . 

and another . 

at one point bob , frustrated with the soap scripts , complains to the head writer ( jim fyfe ) that his and kelly's characters keep on going in circles , with no hint of development or growth . 

that is most certainly the case here . 

joe gets a job and ultimately botches things ; he and mary bicker ; they make up , only to have the pattern repeat itself . 

unhappy with his bottle blonde , bob gets his real blonde but is unsatisfied ; he returns to the faux and is still unsatisfied . 

if there is a point to all of this , dicillo dances around it , spending his time on apparent digressions that , as it turns out , aren't digressions at all . 

the real blonde is not without some amusements . 

it does have the occasional funny line and situation ; leary , henry , lloyd , steve buscemi , and dave chappelle shine in their small roles ; keener is a likable , refreshingly earthy lead ; berkley's appearance is mercifully brief ( she receives outrageously prominent billing and ad placement for a ten-minute role ) ; and there is the irony of having caulfield play a wildly popular soap star who makes the ratings skyrocket ( last year , the actor was fired from the daytime drama all my children after a scant six months--due to lack of viewer interest ) . 

but on the whole , the real blonde is a frustrating sit that lives up to the stereotypes of its title--it may be glossy on the surface , but there's nothing going on inside .

"i think maybe it's time for the batman series to be put to rest . 

not only has the first two films' unsettling insight into what it would really take for someone to make himself into a "" superhero "" been abandoned , but this one throws any lingering realism out the window and goes for all-out camp with few traces of the self-mocking restraint of the relatively light-hearted third installment . 

let me give you an example : in the first scene of the movie , batman ( george clooney ) and robin ( chris o'donnell ) are summoned to a museum that has been literally turned to ice by mr . freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) in an attempt to steal a diamond . 

mr . freeze's thugs are armed with none other than hockey sticks , but this is no problem for our heroes : automatic skates shoot out of their shoes , at which point robin manages to get hold of a hockey stick , grabs the diamond , and stick-handles it through the museum . 

i might have expected this from an airplane-style farce , but i don't think that's what this movie is supposed to be . 

after all , the previous three batman movies were actually fairly realistic by the standards of the superhero/action genre and kept the corny death-defying stunts to a minimum , while playing the obligatory cheesiness with at least some amount of irony . 

not any more ; the list goes on and on in this one . 

robin holds onto the outside of a flying rocket ship 30 , 000 feet high in the atmosphere , climbing in the door to save batman . 

mr . freeze and poison ivy ( uma thurman ) leap from a skyscraper and survive by landing in a small pond . 

a world dominating mad scientist lives in a fortress that seems to have been stolen from the old he-man cartoons . 

my very favorite example is the scene in which batgirl ( alicia silverstone ) gets in a race with motorcycle thugs , during which they come up with the clever notion of dousing the road with gasoline and setting it on fire to distract her . 

not bad , but wouldn't the police ( or maybe batman ? ) 

notice if the road was on fire ? 

i knew gotham city was this crazy anarchic place , but . 

 . 

 . 

 . 

it also seems that the creators of the batman movies are obeying some unwritten rule that there have to be more main characters and plot lines in each successive installment . 

as if three protagonists and two villains weren't enough , batman and robin further weighs itself down with an underdeveloped side story of the failing health of bruce wayne's butler alfred ( michael gough ) , which might have seemed poignant if it wasn't surrounded by so much silliness , as well as several scenes with elle macpherson as bruce's girlfriend which serve no purpose other than to remind us that she is in the movie . 

all this might be semi-excusable if the story were interesting and entertaining , but it isn't . 

in fact , it's kind of boring . 

mr . freeze and poison ivy pale in comparison as villains to past baddies such as jack nicholson's joker and danny devito's penguin . 

their evil plot is as predictable ( schwarzenegger actually pronounces the words , "" today gotham city , tomorrow the world ! "" ) 

as it is lame-brained ( didn't it ever occur to poison ivy that freezing the entire world would kill her precious plants too ? ) . 

and robin's constant challenging of batman mostly just makes him look bull-headed and stupid and makes us wonder why batman ever would have taken him on as a partner in the first place . 

strip away the stars , the fancy set design , and the status as a "" batman movie , "" and all you have here is another barely passable summer action flick . 
"
"yeah , yeah , the advertisements didn't even try to conceal the fact that this movie had only one hook - sex . 

neve campbell and starship trooper's denise richards getting it on ? 

ok ! 

yeah , it's a decent two minutes of film erotica , but even if that's your main interest in this film , there's plenty of cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two minutes . 

wild things does have a lot more to think about than you might expect however . 

nearly every single scene is a huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you guessing , or at least curious to see the next turn , throughout the entire movie . 

but this fast-paced , razor-sharp turning of events doesn't leave much time to enjoy the surprises . 

we start off in a high-class california high school where every student resembles a supermodel in the making . 

guidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) seems to catch the eye of every student , particularly kelly van ryan ( richards ) , daughter of the locally prestigious family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts . 

right off the bat , kelly is using every asset she has in an effort to seduce "" mr . lombardo "" . 

the fund-raiser car wash seems the opportune time , particularly when you wash your guidance counselor's jeep in all white clothes and take plenty of precautions to insure you'll be soaked from head to toe when you're done . 

on the weekend of the car wash , kelly's attempts at seduction fall flat , and when they do , she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her that day . 

naturally sam is thrown into a state of panicked shock at these accusations . 

but the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to a criminal trial when a low-class , marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller ( campbell ) comes forth with a near identical story , also involving her trusted guidance counselor . 

pitting himself against the communities most respected names and authoritarians , sam must prove his innocence thru the aid of his makeshift defense attorney , ken bowden , played by bill murray . 

yes , that bill murray ! 

sound like a good , complete movie ? 

yes , that alone could have been , but this is just the beginning . 

in fact , the trial is over about fifteen or twenty minutes into the film . 

it is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time . 

by the time the movie finishes , you will have gone thru every plot twist imaginable . 

unfortunately , with so much going on , you're not given enough time in one predicament to be as effectively shocked when a new twist comes about . 

this is just one way director john mcnaughton fails to make this movie as fun as it could've been . 

the 113 minutes fly by , and although it never feels underdeveloped , this pretzel of storytelling could've been much more richly realized had a slower pace been taken . 

the acting is incredibly reminiscent of fox prime-time soap operas , which no , is not a good thing . 

and it's not just campbell , who happens to hail from the prime-time fox soap "" party of five "" , but everyone suffers from heavily melodramatic overtones . 

dillon , who was so charming in his understated role in last year's in & out , gives the best performance , and murray's surprising appearance adds some comedic flare to the film . 

in fact , if the whole movie had been promoted as a subtle comedy , even if it was the exact same film , i would actually give it a better grade . 

that's how cheezy it comes off . 

but aside from these two , the rest offer nothing more than some good eye-full's . 

in the right hands , wild things could've been a wickedly delightful , scrumptiously twisted thriller , but instead we get juvenile overuses of profanity and some very laughable displays of acting . 

and what's up with these people passing as high school students ? 

i realize hollywood often casts older actors to play teenage roles , but when i realized it wasn't supposed to be a college they were at , i had to snicker . 

i won't lie - this is definitely a guilty pleasure . 

as corny as it is , it's got some interesting aspects and could deserve at least a "" b "" for effort . 

but if you just want to admire denise richards , go for last year's starship troopers , which was every bit as campy , but a million times better . 

of course , if seeing her breasts is your most important goal , you'll be right at home with wild things . 

perhaps the wildest thing of all is that somebody actually looked at this and thought it deserved to be in theaters .

"underrated movies are a common reoccurrence in show business today . 

1998's 'hope floats' was extremely underrated and was one of the best movies of the year . 

we always get films that make big money at the box-office but critics and audiences pan on them . 

this year 'double jeopardy' is one of those films . 

critics are calling it predictable and worthless , audiences are disappointed with it and think it was a disappointment . 

but as i viewed 'double jeopardy' i found that it was a great movie , it has a surprising sense of humor and a big dose of heart , along with heart-pounding suspense and twists and turns here and there it certainly is a really good movie . 

the always wonderful ashley judd plays libby parsons , a woman with a seemingly normal life : a great loving husband , a beautiful son and a great friend . 

her husband nick parsons has made a surprise for her and is going to buy her the sailboat she has always wanted . 

after a night of bliss libby wakes up in the middle of the night to find blood all over her and all over the sailboat , her husband is missing and there is a bloody knife on deck . 

of course being in shock she picks it up and a coast guard comes over and sees her . 

however she isn't immediately ceased until they find out his life insurance was worth two-million dollars and they start to wonder rather she killed him for the money . 

she pleads not-guilty but is found guilty and sent to prison for six years . 

while making a phone call to her best friend who adopted her son for her and she hears him say hi to his dad , which makes libby's heart stop right there . 

she realizes she must get out and prove that he isn't dead , one of her cell-mates tells her that as long as she has been convicted of a crime she cannot be convicted of it again . 

which means she can shoot him in the middle of mardi gras and they cannot do anything about it . 

after she gets out she goes to a halfway house run by parole officer tommy lee jones . 

he is a man who has had his share of bad things . 

while out for the day she breaks into a school and tries to track down her kid and husband , leading up to some jaw-dropping twists that are both predictable and not . 

whatever happens the film was excellent to me . 

i found the writing well-written as well as the acting was great . 

ashley judd is such a talented and beautiful actress that she is a hero in a sort in this movie . 

even if you know what is going to happen in the end , you don't know how . 

this is one of those movies that you really do know what is going to happen , except you don't know how they are going to make it happen . 

it could be one way or another , it could be this way or that way . 

the movie is highly stylized and extremely well-made . 

it gets most of it's power from the two leads : ashley judd and tommy lee jones both give excellent performances . 

the characters are well-realized and believable and we feel libby's pain when she cannot see her child for 6 years . 

even though a lot of critics didn't like the film , i loved it . 

the director took his time making the movie , and put a lot of shadowing in the movie . 

i found it not to be boring at all and it's only flaw comes from some predictability . 

it moved at a fast pace , has suspense , humor , heart and great acting . 

it earns it's right to be a great movie and to me that's what it was .

"what are we going to do with jim carrey ? 

viewers of television's "" in living color "" know this one-man cartoon from such characters as fire marshall bill . 

viewers also know that "" in living color "" is a skit-show and that a little of jim carrey goes a long way . 

unfortunately , this fact was forgotten by the makers of the carrey comedy ace ventura : pet detective . 

three writers , including carrey , worked on the slapstick story , which sends a self-styled "" pet detective "" on the trail of a stolen dolphin . 

the missing mammal belongs to the miami dolphins , who need their mascot for the upcoming superbowl . 

for plot porpoises , this story works as well as any three stooges short . 

carrey gets to do his "" official "" schtick as he snoops around greater miami . 

he leers and sneers , craning his neck to funny effect . 

he even does his captain kirk impersonation . 

again . 

all of this is pretty harmless stuff up until the point that you realize that the writers have absolutely no intention of focusing on anyone * other * than carrey . 

 ( suggested alternate title--jim carrey : will do anything for a laugh . ) 

export it to france and you may have a hit . 

as it stands , ace ventura isn't even good kid's stuff . 

the profanity count , alone , is too high . 

which is ironic , since children are , probably , carrey's best audience . 

the film doesn't even have the goofball charm of chris elliott's recent no-brainer cabin boy . 

sure , carrey has his moments . 

but what can you say about a film whose high-points include watching carrey slink around to the theme from "" mission impossible ? "" 

ace ventura has one glaring incongruity . 

amid the butt-jokes and double-takes , the script takes great pains to set-up an elaborate and rather funny "" crying game "" gag . 

and , for * this * intended audience , that takes ( ahem ) cojones .

"the happy bastard's 30-second review 

notting hill 

a cute romantic comedy from the writer of the hit comedy four weddings and a funeral , notting hill stars julia roberts as anna scott , a very popular actress with a $15 million asking price for movies . 

one day she wanders into a travel book store owned by a simple london resident ( played by hugh grant ) , and sparks somehow begin to fly . 

sure , there are points of turmoil , such as putting up with grant's slightly disgusting ( but very hilarious ) roommate spike , anna's pesky ex-boyfriend ( alec baldwin in a humorous cameo ) , and , on top of all that , those damn press . 

it's a fresh sort of complexity to see in a romantic comedy , very different from , say , a stubborn father or "" not the right time "" like as seen in usual flicks . 

roberts is terrific as the astonishingly beautiful actress , and grant is surprisingly good as the straightforward guy still trying to get a hold of what has actually happened with this girl . 

in short , a sweet romantic comedy that has a lot of good laughs , particularly provided by spike . 

one tee-shirt really says it all about him . 

in an attempt to turn on a woman , he shows the front of the shirt , which says : "" you are the most beautiful woman in the world . ""

"the relaxed dude rides a roller coaster 

the big lebowski a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman 

the most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider . 

when those observers are joel and ethan coen , the surreal becomes bizarre . 

when the life is that of jeff "" the dude "" leboswki , the bizarre falls over the edge into the world of "" what'sgoingonaroundhere "" . 

the marvelous sound of "" the stranger "" ( sam elliot ) 's voice-over introduces the film . 

at least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up . 

the dude ( jeff bridges ) is described as the "" laziest man in los angeles , possibly the world "" , although he's not so much slothful as he is relaxed . 

spending the last 30 years with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other , he doesn't have much of a life , but he's having a good time . 

when asked what he does for fun , he responds "" bowl , drive around and the occasional acid flashback "" . 

lebowski's passion is bowling . 

when he's not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike , things just happen to him . 

arriving home one night , he's beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them . 

even worse , they urinate on his rug . 

the problem is that the dude doesn't have a wife . 

his assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment . 

the "" big "" lebowski ( david huddleston ) is a multi-millionaire and his dudeness lives in two-room squalor . 

the next day , our ragtag hero visits his namesake's mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug . 

the carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together : not surprisingly since it's virtually the only object there . 

when he's denied any money , he picks up a replacement rug off the floor . 

on his way out , he runs into lebowski's trophy babe wife bunny ( tara reid ) who offers to perform a sexual act that , according to rumor , is one of bill clinton's favorites for a thousand bucks . 

the penniless dude wisecracks that he's heading for the cash machine . 

later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunny's kidnappers . 

this begins the trademarked coen brothers crimes-gone-wrong sequences . 

the kidnappers are impossibly inept . 

the dude and his cronies are even worse . 

every plan goes awry . 

you can almost see lebowski's brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues . 

that's the story , but to tell the truth it doesn't much matter . 

there could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining . 

the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into . 

the dude's bowling buddies walter ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) look like people you'd see on the street but , like everything else in this film , they're not quite what they seem . 

walter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties . 

everything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam . 

when a fellow bowler crosses the foul line but won't admit it , walter pulls a gun on him until he marks a zero on the score sheet . 

donny gets precious few words in between walter's screaming and the dude's rambling . 

when he does , walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns . 

donny is "" out of his league "" and doesn't "" have a frame of reference "" . 

the film is peppered with people for whom the term "" character "" would be an understatement . 

the big lebowski's daughter maude , an avant-garde "" vaginal "" artist , paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an s&m mary martin . 

the kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers . 

bunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star . 

most impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler . 

as the flamenco music swells , we see him putting on his lavender hose . 

the camera pans up to an all-purple skin-tight bowling outfit with "" jesus "" ( pronounced with a "" j "" , not an "" h "" ) embroidered on the pocket . 

he addresses the lane with intense seriousness and one painted fingernail . 

his tongue slowly snakes out and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball . 

bridges works the dude as if he had been living him for decades and maybe he has . 

i can't think of anyone else who could have done a better job . 

buscemi has a limited role , but he plays it perfectly . 

the more that i see john goodman the more convinced i am that he's one of the treasures of our time . 

it's odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barr's television husband . 

more like the coen's "" raising arizona "" than their hit "" fargo "" , "" the big lebowski "" demands an open mind and even more open eyes . 

a mark of the coen brothers is that even with all wonderful dream sequences and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen , much of the humor is subtle and easy to miss . 

there's so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it . 

walking out of the theater , i felt that the film had something important to say . 

on further examination , i wasn't sure exactly what it was . 

 "" if you meet jesus at the bowling alley , it's not going to be what you expect "" ? 

 "" when the going gets weird , the weird go bowling "" ? 

maybe there's no real message .

"i suppose an argument could be made that toy story is one of those films that didn't need a sequel . 

beloved by kids and their parents , respected equally by mainstream america and geekish movie buffs , that first movie remains a landmark of recent history , the one that burst open the possibilities of computer animation and demonstrated through wild invention and giddy chutzpah just how complacent the disney animation machine had become in cranking out fluffy razzle-dazzle entertainment full of formula storytelling and banal songwriting . 

if disney was embarrassed at being beaten at its own game ( toy story was a smash hit of unexpected proportions , and one that caught the merchandising end of the business unaware as demand for action figures far outstripped supply ) , it didn't show , and as distributor and part-owner of the property , at least it had a piece of the action . 

toy story 2 was greenlighted as a direct-to-video project , disney's standard tactic for milking a few more bucks out of hot franchises without expending the effort of developing a proper feature film . 

as someone who doesn't believe sequels are necessarily a bad thing ( granted , they usually are a bad thing , but that's because they're made for the wrong reasons ) , i had to wonder what in the world they were thinking . 

fortunately , disney claimed to have been so knocked-out by early animation tests that they let pixar go full-speed ahead with a theatrical sequel . 

lucky thing , too -- like the first movie , this one is a joy to behold on the big screen , and technically , it improves on its predecessor on just about every level . 

 ( from a business standpoint , the end credits show that the new creations are copyrighted by pixar , while the previous film's elements are shared between pixar and disney , a sign of the production house's new cachet in hollywood . ) 

visually , the main shortcoming of this fully computer-generated movie is that human figures are still rendered relatively poorly , making them look a little creepy . 

fortunately , that eerie unreality fits in perfectly with the perspective of the movie , where the secret world of toys is more immediate , and arguably more attractive , than the world of the humans who surround them . 

as before , the story is predicated on the premise that the toys scattered around the bedroom of a little boy named andy -- and , indeed , all the toys scattered around the bedrooms of all little children -- come to life in the child's absence . 

while the toys scamper about and chatter endlessly among themselves , the real joy of a toy's life is to mean something to its owner . 

one of the subjects of this new film is the sadness of toys that have been broken or abandoned , left on a shelf to gather dust , and another is the sort of emotional limbo inhabited by toys that are mere prizes of covetous collectors . 

most often , those toys are packed away in dark spaces , safe from sunlight and humidity , and often they're not even removed from their packaging . 

imagine what a chip that would put on your shoulder , and you'll understand the attitudes of the collector's items that show up in this movie . 

sheriff woody ( voiced by a note-perfect tom hanks ) , the longtime favorite among andy's toys who was challenged in the previous go-round by the arrival of flashy-new-thing action figure buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) , suffers an injury early in the film , when andy tugs too hard on his arm and pulls a seam apart , revealing the stuffing inside . 

this accident catalyzes some uneasieness among the toys , who know too well that a broken toy is often a forgotten toy , and a forgotten toy is one that loses its reason for existence . 

those anxieties are crystallized when andy's mom tears through his living room , collecting old toys for a yard sale . 

and there's an ironic twist to the tale , as woody winds up being stolen by an avid toy collector who needs exactly that quaint cowboy figure to complete a set that he hopes to sell to a japanese toy museum for a sizable sum . 

the rest of andy's toys , who owe him quite a debt , resolve to rescue him . 

that this film manages to turn a box marked "" 25 cents "" into a symbol of doom , or to make its screed against the retention of collectible toys by wrongheaded profiteers fuel for a metaphysical dilemma , is a testament to its skill at metaphor , seamlessly translating the hopes and fears of our real world into that of the toys . 

operating on this level of abstraction , toy story 2 tackles some mighty heavy issues without once preaching or veering into pretentiousness . 

 ( the worst i can say is that randy newman seems to have reserved his sappiest lyric in years for sarah mclachlan , who stops the movie cold by singing it at just about the halfway mark . ) 

sometimes i think toy story 2 tries too hard . 

there's somewhat less of the seat-of-the-pants loopiness that energized the first film , allowing it to surprise and excite on a near-constant basis , and more philosophizing about toys , collectors , the nature of happiness and the meaning of life . 

while that leads to fewer bellylaughs , it does make way for more elaborate humor and an uncommonly ambitious reflexivity that asks the toys to consider their own status as commodities that move in and out of fashion . 

 ( just don't ask why andy's favorite toy is based on a tv series that was canceled in 1957 . ) 

where else in mainstream movies do you get such an awesome moment as the one where buzz arrives at al's toy barn to find it stocked to the gills with his doppelgangers , buzz lightyear action figures ? 

forget the self-congratulatory science fiction of the matrix -- this is a fundamental mind-bender for buzz , and the audience shares his humility and wonderment at the sight . 

here , as in the roughly concurrent scene where woody watches tapes of the howdy doodyish children's tv show that originated his character , we see our protagonists come face-to-face with god . 

in sly ways , then , toy story 2 can be read as a film about mortality , a metaphorical consideration of aging and death . 

significantly , the film's very first sequence concludes with a grim shocker that had our opening-night crowd in a near-uproar . 

and toward the end , when buzz and woody speculate on how long they have before andy grows up and discards his old toys , one of them observes , with an alacrity both inspirational and heartbreaking , that it will be fun while it lasts . 

so toy story 2 joins the tradition of children's stories , largely neglected of late , that say something real about the inevitable joys and tragedies of existence . 

what's really striking is that both toy story films ( and , to a lesser degree , pixar's a bug's life ) are kids' movies with wit and sophistication to shame most of their ostensibly adult counterparts , not to mention whatever piece of tot-friendly eye-candy is due from the disney dream factory any given summer . 

it puts one in mind of the glory days of chuck jones and the old gang at warner bros . animation . 

i'm not sure lasseter and his pals at pixar will ever operate at quite that level of purely visual invention -- they love traditional narrative too much -- but , boy , it makes me wonder what they might come up with next .

"carolco pictures and dutch director paul verhoeven ( robocop ) came together to create the 1990 mega hit that is total recall . 

the film is a masterpiece of sets , action , and special effects . 

action and science fiction just don't get any better than this ! 

the story involves a construction worker named douglas quaid ( arnold schwarzenegger ) who lives on earth with his beautiful wife lori ( sharon stone ) . 

quaid is obsessed with mars and decides to go with the second best choice ; a brain implant ( fake memory ) of a two week vacation on mars . 

while being implanted a memory cap is triggered and the doctors realize that quaid's memory has previously been erased . 

now the people who did it are after him . 

quaid must find out who he really is and why these people want him dead . 

the plot unfolds at a rapid pace explaining itself through great action , special effects , and twist after mind-boggling twist . 

it grabs you and never lets go ! 

this film is a winner from beginning to end . 

the plot is superb ; combining the best elements of science fiction and psychological mystery to create a rip-roaring saga . 

schwarzenegger gives his best performance ever , and the supporting cast is good too . 

the action and stunts are terrific . 

the sets are huge and elaborate with a lot of attention payed to detail . 

the music and sound effects are perfect for the film and really add a certain level of impact to the action . 

the make-up effects by rob bottin ( the howling , the thing , and robocop ) are top notch , not to mention extremely outlandish . 

the visual effects by dream quest ( the abyss ) and industrial light and magic ( star wars trilogy , jurassic park , and terminator 2 ) are phenomenal ! 

the visuals had such a state of the art "" slickness "" that they won an oscar . 

of course the film isn't always realistic ; it's more fiction than science . 

for example , it is true that a body won't explode in the vacuum of space but in total recall they do . 

who cares ? 

it's a movie . 

movies are supposed to entertain . 

and in my opinion this film achieves an entertainment level in film that is so terrific , it may be impossible to beat .

"for those of us who weren't yet born when the 1960's rock 'n' rolled around , monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies . 

from otis redding to jimi hendrix , janis joplin to the mamas and the papas , and jefferson airplane to the who , this documentary is jam-packed with contagious energy . 

but i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending , which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves . 

shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock , the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time . 

sure , some have painted their faces and smoke joints , but d . a . 

pennebaker ( the war room , moon over broadway ) surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience . 

no matter who is watching , it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul . 

the excitement starts before the music even begins . 

a young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer , she replies that she feels lucky to do so . 

there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips , leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers , tries to get in touch with dionne warwick . 

and when one band is tuning up , a member remarks , "" finally , a decent sound system ! "" 

you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn't about vanity , it's about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it , a two-way street . 

this interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience . 

it's impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain . 

and while the lyrics to "" wild thing "" may not be all that complicated , watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love . 

even if you don't recognize every band you see on stage , you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats . 

the only drawback to the film is the ending , which unfortunately i must reveal . 

all the other bands , big names then and still today , got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time . 

in contrast , the last band on camera , a wholly forgettable one , gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time . 

for a film that's only 78 minutes long , that's too large of a chunk , especially when previous acts are much more stimulating . 

all in all , monterey pop is a precious , rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us . 

the variety of music , as well as the beautifully shot performances , are easy to become immersed in . 

if there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular , this is quickly dispelled . 

it's almost depressing to think that music this moving doesn't get made much anymore . 

instead we're stuck with * nsync , the backstreet boys , and jennifer lopez , all of whom should have stuck with modeling .

"starring shawnee smith ; donovan leitch ; ricky paull goldin ; kevin dillon & billy beck the blob is the remake of the 1960's classic ( a term that i use very loosely to define the original ) about a really mean glob of goop that takes out anything that gets in its way . 

now the original version has the virtue of cheesy special effects which give it a kind of nostalgic campy feel . 

the fact that steve mcqueen was the star of the film doesn't exactly hurt it either . 

fast forward to the late '80's . 

steve mcqueen isn't in the remake ( this might have something to do with the fact that he had been pushing up daisies for years ) . 

nor is there any hollywood heavy hitters in the lead role . 

that is unless you count matt dillon's brother kevin as a hollywood heavy hitter . 

the other thing that works against this new blob is that special effects technology has improved dramatically since the original . 

the only things you need now to have great special effects in a movie are deep pockets . 

it looks as if the produces of the new blob had a couple of holes in their pockets . 

the special effects in this movie are cheesy , like the original's . 

unlike the original , they don't look campy , they just look cheap . 

one bright spot in the movie from a purely sexist point of view is shawnee smith . 

she is very attractive and can actually act , which is more than i can say about some of her costars . 

in terms of plot , a little ball of pink goop falls from the sky . 

seems this goop was an experiment that was being housed up on a satellite . 

anyway , the pink stuff has a taste for humans . 

the more people it absorbs , the bigger it gets . 

and it isn't the friendliest goop on the block either . 

anyway , it attacks this little town and it's up to the attractive local teenage population to stop it . 

not really , but that is how it seems . 

this version attempts to recapture the camp of the original . 

as i've already said , this new version of the blob comes off more as cheap , badly acted , and badly written than campy . 

in the years since this film was made none of the cast have gone on to greatness . 

although , star shawnee smith had a very tiny role in armageddon . 

the reason that we have never heard of any of them again is quite simple -- they all stunk out loud . 

although some of the film's smaller roles are filled with some actors that , while not big stars , are doubtless people that you will recognize from their supporting roles in other movies and tv shows . 

it also appears that the producers of the blob tried to compensate for the lack of a special effects budget by making the scenes in which the blob makes meals of the townsfolk as gory as possible . 

sadly , it doesn't work very well . 

if you want to see a big ball of goop terrorize a town , then i would say that you should skip the remake and rent the original . 

 ( although that isn't so hot either . ) 

this newest version is seriously lacking in any redeeming qualities . 
"
"every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio , with every indication that it will be a stinker , and to everybody's surprise ( perhaps even the studio ) the film becomes a critical darling . 

mtv films' _election , a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon , is a current example . 

did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ? 

the plot is deceptively simple . 

george washington carver high school is having student elections . 

tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an over-achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question , way , way , high . 

mr . "" m "" ( matthew broderick ) , sick of the megalomaniac student , encourages paul , a popular-but-slow jock to run . 

and paul's nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well , for personal reasons . 

the dark side of such sleeper success is that , because expectations were so low going in , the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be . 

you can't help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews , which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have . 

_election , a good film , does not live up to its hype . 

what makes _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_ , released a few months earlier . 

the similarities are staggering : 

tracy flick ( _election_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . 

max fischer ( _rushmore_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . 

the most significant tension of _election_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . 

the most significant tension of _rushmore_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . 

tracy flick is from a single parent home , which has contributed to her drive . 

max fischer is from a single parent home , which has contributed to his drive . 

the male bumbling adult in _election_ ( matthew broderick ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . 

he even gets a bee sting . 

the male bumbling adult in _rushmore_ ( bill murray ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . 

he gets several bee stings . 

and so on . 

what happened ? 

how is it that an individual screenplay ( _rushmore_ ) and a novel ( _election_ ) contain so many significant plot points , and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other , made from two different studios , from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadn't been fully formed yet ? 

even so , the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick , witherspoon , and newcomer jessica campbell , as paul's anti-social sister , tammy . 

broderick here is playing the mr . rooney role from _ferris bueller_ , and he seems to be having the most fun he's had since then . 

witherspoon is a revelation . 

it's early in the year , it's a comedy , and teenagers have little clout , but for my money , witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination . 

and once campbell's character gets going , like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium , then you're won over . 

one thing that's been bothering me since i've seen it . 

there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film . 

i suppose that , coming from mtv films , i should expect no less . . . 

but the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom . 

as the screws tighten , and the tensions mount , alexander payne decides to add elements that , frankly , distract from the story . 

it is bad enough that mr . m doesn't like tracy's determination to win at all costs , but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship ? 

even so , there's no logical reason why mr . m has an affair when he does . 

there's a lot to like in _election_ , but the plot similarities to _rushmore_ , and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex-driven , mark this as a disappointment . 
"
"in 1989 , tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather . 

was it "" deep "" ? 

nope . 

however it was a perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up . 

it was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was "" without the comic book uplift "" of the indiana jones and superman pictures . 

which was true . 

if what you were looking for was the tale of a heroic man's escadapes and adventures you were looking in the wrong place . 

if those films were tom sawyer , then batman was huckleberry finn . 

some critics ( glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone ) realized that it was something special ; mr . lovell gave it * * * 1/2 and wrote that "" this is batman as batman should be . "" ; 

mr . travers called it one of the ten best films of the year . 

the praise was deserved - from start to finish the film was enthralling , exciting , and superb in every respect . 

there was no doubt that there would be a sequel directed by burton . 

the result was batman returns which forgets that it wants to be fun within the first five minutes . 

the villains ( the hideous penguin and seductive catwoman ) take over , and our epectations are always left unfulfilled - when we wanted the penguin to bite off batman's nose he simply gets mad , and when we want catwoman to slither over batman's body she gets pushed off a building . 

i admire mr . burton for trying to do more then entertain , but the result is a mess . 

nothing works out as planned - it fails both to entertain and to enlighten . 

hints are made to the audience that this film could be a blast . 

alas , these are only hints . 

there are , don't misunderstand me , several moments of cinematic genuis contained ; catwoman and batman understand eachother perfectly without a word on the subject being said ; christopher lloyd is trapped , by the penguin , within a giant cage ; a small basket is dropped into a large river ; but nothing is drawn together and burton is unable to make the film work on any regular basis . 

a weak followup , both career and sequel wise , batman returns is sometimes dazzling , but to often dissapointing . 
"
"there's some movies i enjoy even though i know i probably shouldn't and have a difficult time trying to explain why i did . 

 "" lucky numbers "" is a perfect example of this because it's such a blatant rip-off of "" fargo "" and every movie based on an elmore leonard novel and yet it somehow still works for me . 

i know i'm in the minority here but let me explain . 

the film takes place in harrisburg , pa in 1988 during an unseasonably warm winter . 

john travolta plays the local big-shot tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himself and not the bumbling russ richards . 

russ is married to crystal ( lisa kudrow ) , a blonde bimbo if ever there was one in the history of cinema . 

she's a selfish , nasty bitch full of lust and desire but somehow she got the job of the lottery ball girl - not exactly the most intellectually taxing job on the market . 

crystal's cheating on russ with their collective boss dick ( ed o'neil ) , the tv station manager . 

she doesn't seem to genuinely like either of them , but it's all she can do in this one-horse town . 

much like "" fargo , "" this movie tells the story of a man who's going broke and has to pull off a huge scam to get rich quick . 

he enlists the help of his english friend gig ( tim roth ) , the local stripclub owner who tells him how to fix the lottery . 

along the way a subplot involving a two-bit thug named , accurately , "" dale the thug "" ( michael rappaport ) gets mixed up in the process . 

there's also a bookie that somehow gets thrown in the mix once the deal goes down . 

i'm not going to elaborate much further on the plot and story because it continues to unwind and take twists and turns you're not expecting . 

this is a farce , which is basically a straightforward , adult-oriented comedy but doesn't go as far as a classic black comedy should . 

where as "" fargo "" was sometimes shocking and disturbing while being funny , "" lucky numbers "" is just funny because you can't take these characters in these outrageous situations seriously . 

it's all a big cartoon basically , but it's funny and i can respect that . 

travolta is great in his role and even though he's not a really likable character , he's trying to be a nice guy despite the fact he's a creep . 

he's like a gangster with morals who genuinely feels sorry for the guys he has to kill . 

crystal is just the opposite , she's constantly arguing and using whatever brain cells she has left to look out for herself . 

kudrow is perfect in this role since she's spent 8 years on tv as the dim-witted phoebe on "" friends . "" 

here is character is basically a very evil incarnation of phoebe . 

i have to admit i was honestly surprised and pleased by how the plot unraveled and the methods each of the main characters use to try to get their share of the money . 

like "" jackie brown , "" ( an elmore leonard adaption ) , the story is about a circle of 10 characters all after the lottery money that has been won illegally . 

the screenplay does a fine job in balancing the characters and slowly revealing their motivations and hidden agendas while at the same time keep russ richards the main focus . 

more and more characters are introduced and since the film has such an iconic , cartoony atmosphere you can take on faith just what makes the minor characters do what they do . 

the ending itself is great . 

it's surprising and funny and makes you feel good . 

you realize this film has packed in about 10 different movies' worth of stories into two hours' time and didn't fall apart ( although many other critics might beg to differ ) . 

i liked it , and i could see it again - isn't that what makes a movie good ? 
"
"i came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor , an innocuous-enough-on-the-surface romantic comedy . 

it's not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity , but there it was nonetheless . 

i sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999 . 

in a word , it's the same thing that's wrong with so many movies circa 1999 : writing . 

more to the point , it's the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when you're telling a story about a relationship . 

the bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where we're expected to get dewy-eyed over any pairing of attractive , pleasant people just because they're attractive and pleasant . 

in this particular case , attractive and pleasant exhibit a is jimmy shannon ( chris o'donnell ) , a single guy who has been watching his friends slowly but surely sucked into marriage . 

it's a scary notion for jimmy , even though he dearly loves attractive and pleasant exhibit b anne ( renee zellweger ) , his girlfriend of three years . 

convinced despite his reservations that it's time to "" sh * t or get off the pot , "" jimmy proposes to anne -- very badly . 

anne refuses , which leaves jimmy in a very odd position when his eccentric grandfather ( peter ustinov ) dies and leaves a very specific video will . 

jimmy stands to inhereit $100 million if he is married by 6 : 05 p . m . on his 30th birthday , stays married for 10 years and produces a child . 

there are only a couple of minor problems : 1 ) jimmy's 30th birthday is the next day ; 2 ) anne is nowhere to be found , meaning jimmy has to find another willing bride from among his many ex-girlfriends . 

it's a wacky , brewster's millions-esque premise ( acknowledged as such in one of the film's better , more self-aware lines of dialogue ) , the kind where a shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters . 

at least that would be the case if jimmy weren't already a world-class altruist . 

screenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even more draconian condition in the will : if jimmy doesn't get married , not only will he lose all the money , but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out from under him , costing hudreds of jobs . 

from the outset , jimmy's motivation isn't cash ; it's the livelihoods of his devoted employees . 

it's almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in the bachelor's plot development . 

by any human standard , the guy is impossibly selfless . 

and that's the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor -- the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness . 

there's never any tension between the two star-crossed lovers , because there's no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake . 

the blandly nice o'donnell couldn't pull off a randy cad if he tried , so the filmmakers don't even let him ; zellweger's anne may have issues with her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard to live up to , but no one dares make her anything but the woman ( lightly ) wronged . 

and forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation . 

the parade of sit-com set pieces had better be damned funny , since they're all that stands between us and a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion . 

i'll admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing , including ustinov's rantings about procreation and a restaurant full-to-bursting with men popping questions and champagne corks . 

far more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly , like the shudder-inducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortune-hunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in a church . 

you're never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film like the bachelor , but that's not the real problem . 

nor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warm-n-fuzzy conclusion it's leading up to . 

the problem are a beginning and middle that are equally warm-n-fuzzy -- there's no spark , no energy , no humanity . 

it's an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumer's digestions . 

we've reached a point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment don't even have a pulse . 

the bachelor is love among the mannequins . 
"
"richard linklater's "" slacker , "" made in 1991 for a budget of only $23 , 000 , immerses itself in the twentysomething , college-town culture of austin , texas . 

most of these characters are either unemployed or work jobs that are apparently too menial to be worth mentioning . 

their lifestyle is a sort of passive resistance to the idea that people should go out and actively pursue a career after graduation ; they seem content to sit around spouting off about the inadequacy of american democracy , the pervasiveness of slave morality , the subtle messages in pop culture , and such . 

ask them what they've been doing lately , and they'll more likely than not reply , "" oh , you know , just hanging out . "" 

linklater uses an interesting technique to examine these characters : the camera follows one person for a few minutes , then someone else walks by and the camera follows that person , who walks into a diner just as another person is walking out the door . 

 . 

 . 

 . 

it's certainly a lot of fun listening to these characters talk : some of them are clearly very intelligent and have some genuinely insightful ideas , some of them are just plain weird , and some of them think their ideas are a lot more profound than they really are . 

the opening monologue , delivered by linklater himself to a taxi driver , tosses around ideas about alternate realities that nicely set up the meandering structure of the film . 

other characters along the way offer observations about everything from dating relationships to the history of anarchist philosophy , while groups of pseudo-intellectuals kick around ideas about the nobility of sitting around and doing nothing or the subtle bribery-based morality in "" scooby-doo . "" 

for the most part , however , the best moments are the ones involving the slightly unhinged types . 

near the beginning , a paranoid man follows a pedestrian for several blocks , warning him about government conspiracies involving everything from global warming to secret colonization of mars . 

another man seems to be collecting televisions , keeping at least fifteen sets running at the same time and playing tapes of a graduate student who recorded himself having a nervous breakdown and destroying the camera . 

and in a scene that drew a big laugh from everyone present when i saw the film , a man tries to achieve closure after a failed relationship by reciting poetry on a bridge and then throwing a typewriter into the creek below . 

the only problem with "" slacker "" is that it starts to run out of steam towards the end . 

since linklater only spends a few minutes with each character , the introduction of the new characters gets repetitive after a while . 

there are only so many times you can hear , "" hey , what's going on ? "" 

 "" not much , what are you up to ? "" 

 "" nothing really , just hanging around , "" before it gets on your nerves ; the film might well have benefited from a slightly slower pace and a little bit more characterization . 

and the dialogue in the second half of the film is by and large not quite as interesting as that in the first half ; a jfk buff , for example , seems like a pale imitation of the previous conspiracy theorist , and many of the characters just generally aren't as weird or unique . 

instead of depicting a city populated by mostly normal people and then showing us the strangeness that we might not have noticed at first , linklater shows us the oddballs first , then stops and reminds us that ordinary people live there too . 

 "" slacker "" is a good film and a wonderfully offbeat and entertaining comedy , whatever its flaws , and its status as a cult classic is well-deserved . 

i just can't help but think it might have been even better if linklater had slowed down a little bit and filmed these scenes in reverse order .

"notting hill's trailer is awful : a laughless , schmaltzy montage . 

the movie was desperately marketed to the anti-phantom menace crowd , the same lovelorn females who ignored the love letter . 

and it apparently worked . 

perhaps the presence of julia roberts-whose allure beyond those perfect teeth still escapes me-had a lot to do with notting hill's opening weekend success , but the film's staying power is based on word of mouth . 

allow me to spread some more good buzz for notting hill . 

grant stars as william thacker , a travel-bookstore owner who works and resides in a tiny english district called notting hill . 

into his shop one day wanders famous actress anna scott ( roberts ) . 

a common thief , some spilled orange juice , and some stilted conversation leads to their first , highly impetuous ( or is that improbable ? ) , kiss . 

days later , william sneaks into her hotel suite under the guise of a magazine journalist , and so begins a passionate , albeit surreptitious , affair . 

 ( aside : notting hill's portrayal of press junkets is deadly accurate . ) 

only anna's celebrity-or william's lack thereof-threatens to drive a wedge between them . 

richard curtis has tapped into fantasy we all have considered , and for at least its first half-hour the picture's "" beauty and the beast "" -like scenario is ( romantic ) escapism of the highest order . 

as with groundhog day or pleasantville , while watching the high-concept comedy notting hill one constantly imagines him/herself in the lead ; it's william's ordinaryness that entices the spoiled and bored anna . 

curtis ( who previously penned four weddings and a funeral ) is also smart enough to know that the unlikely couple's situation is not enough to fuel two hours' worth of entertainment , so some of notting hill's finest moments revolve around william's eccentric friends and family . 

by now , dear reader , you've probably heard a lot about rhys ifans' performance as william's imbecilic welsh flatmate . 

yes , he's a crowd pleaser , a walking sight gag , but his character is not nearly as involving as the wheelchair-bound ( and appropriately named ) bella ( mckee , the anguished waitress of naked ) or max ( tom mcinnerny ) , her lousy chef of a husband . 

in the movie's best sequence , william , anna , and company sit around bloated from max's latest concoction and hold a contest : the last brownie on the table goes to the diner with the saddest life . 

the scene ends only as a british writer would end it . 

if anything , fantastic bits like these dull the main plot's dramatic impact . 

roberts and grant , especially , are appealing , but their relationship is convolutedly interrupted too many times ( four weddings' suffered similar flaws ) , and william and anna ultimately only have one thing in common : they're lonely . 

 ( worth noting in roberts' and grant's favour : the ubiquitous "" i'm just a girl , standing across from a boy , asking him to love her "" episode is not nearly so syrupy as it appears in clips , and it features some of the best emoting either actor has ever done . ) 

notting hill is nonetheless enjoyable ; on the visual side of things , i especially appreciated michell's playful changing-of-the-seasons number . 

if only ( and this is a surprisinly minor gripe ) he had lopped off the egregious epilogue ; for a story that thrives on what we bring to it , the filmmakers work too hard to tidy things up , leaving our imaginations in the lurch .

"the bond series is an island in the film world ; where else would we look forward to cliches , and all of the other things that occur in most of these films ? 

where else would pure escapism , a vulnerable hero , the "" talking villains , "" blatant product placement , predictable action sequences , and lots of promiscuity be hoped for instead of a significant change ? 

i don't understand it myself , but that's what the bond series is based on . 

for ( i think ) 18 films , we've mostly got the same thing over and over again , with some variation ( and a bit of change , most notably in the two dalton films ) . 

but even i , a king of cynicism , can't bitch about it . 

and "" tomorrow never dies , "" the ( again , i think ) eighteenth bond film , and second brosnan bond film , is no exception . 

thank god ! 

the plot , as in most of them , is pure balderdash , but seems to have a nice kind of edge to it . 

instead of just plain billionaire psychotics , we get a rupert murdoch-esque media mogul/psychotic - elliot carver ( jonathan pryce , looking bitching with a white-haired cru cut , and always talking like he's out of breath ) , who has the admittingly ingenius idea of getting ratings by creating a war . 

no , this is not "" wag the dog "" - he wants a real war , between china and england , and is stupid enough to put the coverage out before anyone else discovered it . . . in 

comes bond . 

james is sent all around the world , trying to do research on carver , fighting with his men , and running into ( on more than one occasion ) a chinese secret agent like him : wai lin ( michelle yeoh , asian action star extraordinaire . . . and 

co-star of "" supercop , "" nearly stealing the screen from jackie chan in that one ) . 

the two eventually , and predictably of course , begin working together , and yes , there is some sexual tension between the two . 

luckily , their relationship is never strained , and she never gives into his cassanova-ness until the finale . 

thank god again . 

in every bond film , james bags , on average , three women ( sometimes more , sometimes less - the latter being more potent towards the aids-cautionary dalton ) , and he doesn't spoil this one ( though we never see them , of course - i mean , they need to stay around a pg-13 rating ) . 

there's always one at the beginning with some chick we never see again , the big bond girl ( yeoh ) , and this time we have an almost-cameo by teri hatcher as carver's wife , paris , who , it seems , was once one of the girls he bags at the beginning . 

yes , teri's very attractive , but she seems kind of dull . 

of course , it's not really her fault ; her part is under-written , and she's only in a small part of it . 

oh well . 

and there are always the big henchmen , the guys who do the dirty work for the polished big villains . 

this time we get a tall , arian-looking ( not to mention robert shaw in "" from russia with love "" -looking ) guy named stamper ( goetz otto ) , who is pretty awesome , although a bit stiff ( well , mostly his posture , really ) . 

and for a bit of comedy , we get a cameo from vincent shiavelli as a german or austrian assassin who is ordered to do in bond at one point . 

the government people have small parts , as usual , with q ( desmond llewelyn , looking near death , sadly ) getting only one scene ( in a more grouchy mood than usual ) , and m ( judi dench ) , getting more than m usually gets ( i mean , it is judi dench ) . 

and for no reason whatsoever , except 'cause he was so good in "" goldeneye , "" joe don baker shows up again as wade , admitting he has no reason for being there , and is this time more annoying . 

again , oh well . 

the action sequences are not a let-down , although sometimes go on too long . 

they pop up every now and then , mainly because they have to ( for the sake of the series ) , and some significant ones are the opening one , one in a garage with a bmw that runs on remote control , and a motorcylce chase ( on a bmw cycle , nonetheless ) through china streets ( or was it vietnam . . . the 

plot's not really essential ) . 

they're more high-tech , and feature much more laughs , which , yeah , i dig . 

so what if they're distracting ; they're supposed to be ! 

the acting , from most around is great . 

yeoh is , actually , one of the better bond girls , mainly because she's so unique . 

the better bond girls are more independent , and have a certain wily-ness to them . 

pussy galore , with her homoerotic undertones and all , is one of the best , and diana rigg , who married bond at the end of "" on her majesty's secret service "" only to be killed , added some emotional depth . 

yeoh is notable since she's so active , and has great chemistry with brosnan . 

pryce is an awesome villain , being slimy and lovable at the same time . 

and brosnan is , once again , the mack daddy . 

the bond series is built on cliches , mainly because they're so fun and add to the escapism . 

if you can remember the dalton years , and they're serious direction , you remember how unsuccessful they were , both financially and aesthetically . 

the series would falter if bogged down with too much plot , too many themes , and too much characterization . 

i don't really understand it myself , yet i'm one of the bigger fans of the series in the northeast united states . 

having seen all of them more than once ( yes , i've seen this twice already ) , you can tell i adore them . 

while it's not one of the best , like "" goldfinger "" or "" from russia with love , "" "" tomorrow never dies "" is nonetheless a truly awesome installment , even if not being as fully amazing as some of the better ones . 
"
"as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it , the more pleased i was when i left . 

first , getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz : "" if you liked scream , you'll love wild things ! "" 

 "" campbell gives a stunning performance ! "" 

 "" this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days ! "" 

 ( oh yeah , the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me ) 

now , onto more serious stuff ( and with this film , i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way ) . 

wild things has single-handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa . 

i'm not saying that in a bad way , but when you see this film , you may be shocked by what you see . 

however , perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film's charming cast and tricky plot , that they let the film slide with an r rating . 

being mormon , i'm bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film . 

trouble is , i have already seen it . 

and i like it ! 

wild things is a film noir of the 90s , filled with 40s sensibilities , and yet breaking the rules and modern-day taboos of 90s culture . 

the style in which it is filmed is rich in color . 

the actors are all gorgeous people , seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film . 

sure , it's all too good to be true , but ain't it fun to watch ? 

when movies like this come along ( sort of a better version of basic instinct ) there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it . 

there will be people who don't want to admit liking what they see , but i tell you , most anyone who sees this will like it . 

wild things begins at blue bay high school , the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into . 

it's almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance ( totally based on looks alone ) . 

of course , there are those select few who may look slightly ugly , but compared to the average person , they are gorgeous . 

immediately , the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time . 

we can turn off our brains , right ? 

wrong . 

while you may be expecting one thing to happen , it certainly doesn't turn out that way . 

the film begins in a classroom , with nearly all the main characters present . 

there's sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a counselor for the students . 

he's heading the class discussion . 

there's also kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam . 

teaching the class , however , are two policemen : ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) , who want to talk about 'sex . . . 

 ( cheers ) crimes ( boos ) ' . 

 "" what is a sex crime ? "" 

ray asks . 

 "" not gettin' any ! "" 

one student responds . 

this pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch . 

however , upon hearing this , one student , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , stands up and leaves the room , commenting that they can both kiss part of her body . 

and so , wild things sets into motion . 

quickly , kelly begins hitting on sam , but sam doesn't want anything to do with her advances . 

kelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him . 

she even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep . 

surprisingly , that's really all i can tell you about the plot . 

any more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists . 

and what's more , these plot twists are actually unpredictable . 

going along the way of scream , wild things maintains that film's surprises , and then adds even more to them . 

there are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen . 

and even though you think you may get tired of them , the surprises are so genuine that it's rather pleasing . 

going back over them in my mind , nearly all of them work , though some stretch the boundaries of belief . 

thankfully , the convoluted plot doesn't give us much time to think about each one , pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off . 

as for the critics who complain that the film is trashy--well , it is . 

this is pretty much just one trashy film . 

however , it is the kind of trashy that isn't hard to watch . 

it's good trash , in a sense . 

one , the screenplay knows that it's not to be taken seriously , and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story . 

this varies everywhere from kelly's mother ( theresa russell ) , who is more of a caricature of rich people , all the way to an ambulance-chasing lawyer ( bill murray ) , who wears a neck-brace to cover an insurance scam he is running . 

bill murray also provides the best character in the film , and most of the genuine laughs . 

and two , the sex is more than gratuitous , although not unwelcomed . 

wild things is supposed to have sex in it ( what film with that title wouldn't ? ) , and this movie breaks the boundaries . 

instead of having heterosexual sex scenes , it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell ( don't worry . . . 

it's not as graphic as you might think ) . 

the heterosexual scenes are quite graphic , but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon's full-frontal nude scene . 

it's very brief , so if you blink , you may miss ( ahem ) it . 

and , for as long as i can remember , i don't think i have seen an r-rated film show an erect one before ( it's not completely , but judging from the audiences' reaction , it was more than they expected too ) . 

also , during one scene late in the film , there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillon's characters , but nothing came of it ( makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating , or if the actors refused to do it ) . 

what first made me want to see wild things was its cast . 

neve campbell , of course , has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released . 

here , however , she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead . 

the closest role to this was her performance in the craft ( though even in that she was a nice girl ) . 

campbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent . 

you can tell she will be around for a long time . 

denise richards will also be around for a long time , although she may be limited to the roles without much range . 

here , she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff ( yet effective ) performance in starship troopers . 

hopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability . 

and then there is daphne rubin-vega , a newcomer to the movies . 

she gives a very good performance , although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half . 

towards the end she does get a bigger part . 

on the male side , matt dillon is probably the best , giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist . 

kevin bacon has a slightly wooden character , but he makes the most of it . 

you must have admiration , though , for what he did on screen . 

and judging from many of the women's reactions in the theater to that shot , they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon ( yeah , right ) . 

and then there is bill murray . 

his performance is the comic relief , and he nearly steals the film . 

as a whole , the entire cast works wondrously together , and they seem at home , even when doing the menage a troi . 

director john mcnaughton , who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry : portrait of a serial killer , has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works . 

his direction is smooth and stylish . 

the visuals are striking , filled with rich colors , and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air . 

however , he seems more at home when the actors aren't talking . 

his fly-by shots of the swampy areas are brilliant , and his photography of denise richards' climbing out of the pool is a highlight . 

the cinematography is gorgeous in its details . its not often that you see a film like this , and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures . 

then , there is the music . 

this was probably the most obvious thing to me , as it set the perfect mood for the film . 

it's hard to describe in words , so just see the film and listen to it . 

it's wonderfully composed and presented . 

and be sure to stick around during the closing credits ! 

mcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use ( while most comedies use it for outtakes ) . 

he has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events . 

some may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot , but it's an entertaining way to finish the film . 

plus , there are some shocking moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun . 

wild things is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality , nudity , language and violence . 

again , the nudity is rather unnecessary , but let's face it--people want to see it . 

so why not give it to them ? 

neve campbell , admirably , has a no-nudity clause in her contract , and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off ( way to go , neve ! ) . 

the sex scenes are graphic , especially the first one we see , between the mother and one of her deck hands . 

one almost wonders how they got away with the r rating . 

the language is quite harsh too , ranging from sexual innuendo to your average , everyday profanity . 

and i can't stress it enough : don't allow kids under 18 to see this film . 

the target age for the movie is the 18-24 range , and that's who should see it . 

it's definitely not for those under 18 ! 

did i mention that this film is rated r ? however , for those that do get a chance to watch it , you will probably more likely be pleased , and may even take friends to see it the next time . 
"
"there is a rule when it comes to movies . 

a sequel is never as good as the original . 

there are very few exceptions to this rule , and texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation is not one of them . 

now if you also take into consideration that the original chainsaw massacre was a really bad movie , and that this isn't even the first sequel to it , you have a recipe for a very painful viewing experience . 

don't be fooled by the presence of up and coming talents matthew mcconaughey ( a time to kill ) and renee zellweger ( jerry maguire ) . 

they made this movie before they were stars . 

judging by their performances they also made it before they took any acting lessons . 

it's a wonder they ever worked in hollywood again after appearing in this turkey . 

apparently the producers of this film realized just how bad it was , because it sat unreleased for years until someone decided that they might be able to capitalize off the success of mcconaughey and zellweger . 

apparently the two young stars were none too happy about this thing ever seeing the light of day . 

and i don't blame them , they would have been better off if this had been some sort of porno flick starring the two of them . 

unfortunately for them it is a horror film in which zellweger plays your typically stupid horror film character . 

while mcconaughey plays a guy who wears a mechanical brace on his leg that he controls with a television remote control . 

 ( hey , don't say i didn't warn you . ) 

to make matters worse , leatherface , the chainsaw wielding maniac , who was never the scariest of psychopathic killers at the best of times , has now become a full blown cross-dresser , and spends the entire movie in drag . 

there is a plot to this movie but it isn't worth mentioning . 

let's just suffice to say that a group of teenagers are in the typical wrong place at the wrong time and are left to the mercy of remote control man ( mcconaughey ) and his lipstick wearing chainsaw revving half-witted sidekick . 

man , i can't get over just how bad this movie is . 

this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities . 

even the obligatory topless babe shot wasn't enough to hold my interest for more than 2 seconds . 

the writing is bad , the direction is even worse , but both of those things look good in comparison to the acting . 

this is the sort of movie that they should make people in prison watch . 

a guarantee you , if criminals thought that they would be subjected to this film they would never break the law again . 
"
"let me first say that the conditions that i was forced to watch the matrix under were less than ideal . 

so i have tried to be as fair as possible considering that my viewing experience was significantly less than ideal . 

i watched the matrix in a theater that is in serious need of upgrades at the best of times . 

under no circumstances , should it have ever been allowed to show a big budget special effects laden film like the matrix . 

this theater , owned by the parent company of one of hollywood's biggest studios , hasn't even graduated into stereo sound yet . 

the mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out of a speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement age . 

in other words , the sound sucked . 

as someone used to digital sound in a movie theater , bad sound doesn't do anything to add to a film . 

i'm not even going to go into the horrible splicing job that the projectionist did putting this film together . 

there , i've had my rant , now on with the regularly scheduled review . 

which sadly won't include commentary on the film's sound which i'm assuming was spectacular , but i'm just guessing . 

my guess on the sound seems like a fairly solid one considering the visual quality of the matrix . 

it is nothing short of stunning visually . 

sadly , the rest of the film , while pretty good , doesn't quite measure up to the obvious effort that was expended on making this film look so darn good . 

the matrix has at it's core a good concept , although it strays into the confusing side more often than i would have liked . 

keanu reeves plays a computer hacker who is drawn into the frightening realization that reality is just a hoax . 

it turns out that that many years ago the world was devastated by some sort of disaster . 

now machines run the planet and humans spend their lives in a sort of incubator , plugged into a computer network . 

the computers are generating a virtual reality world which is a representation of the earth before it was destroyed . 

the population of the planet never realizes that their entire life is a hoax and that they really spend their entire lives as comatose . 

that is except a small band who have discovered this horrible secret and have escaped their virtual prisons . 

they now spend their lives combating the computers in an effort to expose this lie . 

reeve's character , neo , is recruited by this band of rebels led by morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) . 

newcomer carrie-anne moss and one of hollywood's most underrated actors , joe pantoliano , join fishburne in the band of freedom-fighters . 

the action sequences are nothing short of spectacular . 

this can be attributed as much to the amazing special effects as to many of the actor's extensive pre-production training in martial arts . 

this lends itself to some of the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely to see in a film . 

when you add this to some of the wild effects in the computer generated world , it all adds up to an eyeful . 

as i already said , the visuals far outpace the rest of the film . 

acting in the matrix is not bad , but it certainly isn't real good either . 

keanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances . 

although to his credit , it is one of his better performances . 

laurence fishburne on the other hand often seemed to forget that he was in a sci-fi action film . 

more than a few times he delivered his lines as if he thought he was performing in some sort of shakespearean drama . 

joe pantoliano was a little under used in this film but he made the most with what he had . 

carrie-anne moss turned out a surprisingly good performance for this her first feature film role . 

it's nice to see that she was cast as much for her talent as for her breathtaking looks . 

you have to give all of the main actors a healthy dose of credit for the work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles in this film . 

it was clear that no small effort went into getting the moves down perfectly for the fighting sequences . 

i also put much of the blame for the somewhat strained performances in the matrix on the dialogue , which was terrible at times . 

in more than a few places it got way too existential for my liking and at other times it was just plain weird . 

it almost seems as though the writers were having a difficult time trying to figure out how to explain the concept for the movie . 

so they decided to make the dialogue as obtuse as possible so that no one could figure out what the heck they were talking about . 

thereby covering up any leaps of faith that they may have had to make in the departments of logic and believability . 

my other major complaint with the matrix was with the very unsatisfying ending . 

the setup for it was hokey and frankly used in many a bad film before . 

the ending itself was just plain strange . 

the main reasons to recommend the matrix are the visual effects and computer animation which make this a real treat to watch . 

while the rest of the film ( acting , dialogue and to a degree plot ) detract from the high production values , they don't detract enough to prevent me from recommending the matrix as a fun way to spend an evening . 
"
"playwright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task : they wanted to write a script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare's works . 

they also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare : i mean , really , who doesn't think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate , introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter ? 

stoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare , and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare . 

and , despite the difficulty of their task , they have succeeded . 

shakespeare in love is one of the smartest , funniest , most touching films of the year . 

it's so rare that a picture with such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors , but here we have a movie that defines success : it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly written . 

it could have been a smug , self-important movie that panders to die-hard shakespeare fans , but the appeal of this film is almost universal : if you've ever read a play by shakespeare , or know anything about his life , it's likely that you'll find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love . 

joseph fiennes , brother of ralph , stars as shakespeare himself ; he's a delightful , irresistible lad , concerned mostly with women and detached from life's more serious problems ( debt , plague , etc . ) . 

he's commissioned to write plays for various people : queen elizabeth ( judi dench ) wants comedies , while local slimeball philip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) needs him to write a play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann ( tom wilkinson ) . 

shakespeare , however , has trouble focusing on his work . 

he begins work on a comedy about a boy named romeo and a girl named ethel . 

this all changes , however , when he meets viola de lesseps ( a radiant gwyneth paltrow ) , a young heiress set to marry the financially-oriented lord wessex ( colin firth ) . 

shakespeare instantly falls in love with her ; he first meets her when she pretends to be a man to try out for the part of romeo . 

he discovers her identity and confronts her later ; she , of course , falls in love with him , although their love is doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex . 

but she continues to act because she loves shakespeare's writing so much , and soon the production ( which later becomes romeo and juliet ) is set to be performed . 

shakespeare in love is an amazingly good film , not because it works as great entertainment , but because it pays attention to detail and knows its subject matter . 

i was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role : he has such searing optimism and energy ; he's clearly a man who admires shakespeare , and even in the shortcomings that he gives his character ( inability to turn away from women , attention deficit disorder ) , we sense a great deal of affection and care . 

he practically overflows with passion in every scene . 

fiennes is matched by paltrow ( whose english accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes from ) ; she is an actress who exudes strength and conviction in every performance i've seen her in . 

the two performers work perfectly together , taking the passionate scenes as far as possible without making them melodramatic , and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laugh . 

of course , it doesn't hurt that they have a masterful script to work with . 

stoppard , whose play rozencrantz and guildenstern are dead inspired an interesting film , is full of dry wit and boundless understated humor ( all of his plays have similarly dry humor ) . 

the first intelligent step stoppard and norman took was harmonizing the events of the film with romeo and juliet . 

one of the funniest scenes in the film is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play ; in the movie , shakespeare is bumbling about while viola is trying to fend off her nurse maid . 

director john madden does a fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor -- scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in the hands of a lesser director . 

i'm going to have to see the movie again ; i'm certain there are numerous references that i missed . 

in fact , i doubt it's possible to gather everything with just one viewing . 

stoppard is a master of detail : you'll notice familiar lines placed throughout the film , not as lines of a play , but as dialogue , suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like that all the time . 

there's also a brilliant running joke in which shakespeare is in constant competition with christopher marlowe ( and the fact that marlowe is played by the openly-homosexual rupert everett is a joke in of itself ) , proposing a slightly twisted explanation to marlowe's mysterious death in a pub . 

there's also a scene featuring a wide-eyed dog that is so funny that i hurt myself laughing . 

 "" there's no dog in this play ? "" 

 "" no ! 

no dog ! "" 

the ensemble cast is perhaps the strongest this year . 

geoffrey rush is nearly unrecognizable as the detestable henslowe ; wilkinson is also hard to recognize , but has a great role as a thug who takes his part as the apothecary so seriously . 

ben affleck , playing one of the actors in the company , shows great range , both in his accent ( his is almost as good as paltrow's ) and in humor ( he has some of the best one-liners in the movie ) . 

colin firth , always stuck playing the sap , does a good job being hateful . 

judi dench , however , has the best supporting performance as queen elizabeth : rarely has so much depth been conveyed in so few words . 

my single , minor complaint about shakespeare in love is that i feel like i could have been more moved by the end . 

the story is moving , but there are a few missed opportunities in the final scenes . 

but my quibbling is not important . 

what is important is that i acknowledge the quality of this picture , the sheer skill with which it has been written , acted , and produced . 

shakespeare in love tries so many things , and nails every one of them : it's a film that both loves shakespeare and makes fun of him , a film in which the actors , writers , and director are all perfectly in sync . 

it's also a movie that has the potential to introduce a lot of people to shakespeare's work in a positive way , without seeming condescending or superior . 

i admire this film not only because it passes so pleasantly , but because it has lofty aspirations and succeeds in them . 

not just any film can poke fun at shakespeare and get away with it .

"synopsis : captain picard and the crew of the starship enterprise disobey federation orders and defend a peaceful community of 600 , the ba'ku , from the evil admiral dougherty and ru'afro . 

the enterprise crew , in the meantime , experience the rejuvenating qualities of the ba'ku homeworld : lt . worf grows a pimple , data sings opera pieces , picard scores with a ba'ku chick , riker shaves while sharing a bubblebath with troi , and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts . 

comments : "" star trek : the next generation "" was a hugely successful sequel tv series to "" star trek , "" a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the 1970s . 

even though it still enjoyed high ratings , "" star trek : the next generation "" ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original "" star trek "" 's cast in paramount's film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise . 

star trek : insurrection is the ninth "" star trek "" movie and the third to focus on the "" star trek : the next generation "" crew . 

star trek : insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans , such as myself , would rate somewhere between "" okay "" and "" good . "" 

after star trek v : the final frontier , a nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant "" star trek : voyager "" tv series , "" star trek "" fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise . 

i don't wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies . 

most people reading this probably haven't followed "" star trek "" anyway , so a comparison would seem tedious at best . 

let me , thus , make my comparisons briefly so that it's out of my system : star trek : insurrection is not as good as the previous installment , star trek : first contact ; star trek : insurrection's comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv : the voyage home ; star trek ii : the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie . 

okay . let's move to the movie itself . 

star trek : insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise , humanity's exploration and colonization of space , with a lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners . 

this combination works well more often than it fails , but when it does fail , the humor really seems cheesy . 

much of this film appeals to trek fans' nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise's crew . 

audiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times . 

star trek : insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the ba'ku homeworld . 

forget the actors and special effects , the beautiful setting of this movie , with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys , steals the show . 

this tranquility , however , is broken by data , an android , who reveals to the ba'ku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien allies , the son'a . 

it seems that this world is a veritable fountain of youth , sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in a young , healthy state . 

the enterprise crew , led by captain picard , investigates data's actions and uncovers a conspiracy between the son'a and an enterprise admiral to relocate the ba'ku and plunder the planet's youth-restoring properties . 

sound pretty heavy ? 

it is , though this plot , anything but unique and groundbreaking , is undermined by the film's constant barrage of humor . 

when going after data , for instance , picard sings an opera piece with him ( this is supposed to be cute and humorous ) . 

in a much more funny sequence , work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the ba'ku homeworld , a pimple which his crewmates , try as they might , cannot avoid looking at . 

the acting in star trek : insurrection is , for the most part , pretty good . 

since they've been playing these characters for years , those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough . 

the terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean-luc picard and delivers a moral speech , picard's trademark , with his usual aplomb . 

brent spiner , another fine actor , plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film ( though the old android-wishing-to-be-human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series ) . 

the supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good . 

despite many other critics' negative opinions , f . murray abraham ( the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus ) plays the major villain ru'afro well enough . 

ru'afro reminds me , somewhat , of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune . 

like the baron , ru'afro continuously has his skin looked after : it is stretched and stapled by servants . 

in one particularly memorable scene , ru'afro becomes very agitated , and his facial skin splits open and bleeds . 

ru'afro is no khan from star trek ii--the best trek villain ever--but he is much better than the forgettable dr . soran from star trek : generations . 

 ( okay , i promise , no more comparisons . ) 

donna murphy must also be noted as a ba'ku woman , anij , who picard falls in love with . 

murphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body ; she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance . 

this is the type of woman whom picard , for those who know the character well , would be enchanted with . 

in fact , the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here . 

a particular plot point involving anij's ability to slow time down , an ability which she shares with picard , becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie . 

for as good as the actors and setting were , star trek : insurrection's special effects were surprisingly disappointing . 

they proved adequate , sometimes barely , for a 1990s mainstream science fiction film , but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars : the phantom menace ( a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection ) . 

the space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships , in particular , seemed trite and unsuspenseful , and the final confrontation between picard and ru'afro took place on a completely unconvincing interior of a satellite . 

the new enterprise itself , only seen in this film and its predecessor , remains largely unexplored , though its exterior doesn't look quite right for a reason i cannot explain . 

despite star trek : insurrection's frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects , i enjoyed the film . 

it maintains roddenberry's largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors , particularly star trek : first contact ( though , don't get me wrong , the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully ) . 

i'd recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon , especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general . 

rated pg , i can't see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience , young or old .

"seen april 16 , 1999 at 10 p . m . at crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n . y . ) , theater #15 , by myself for free using my hoyts' critic's pass . 

[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good seats , sound and picture] 

do you realize that every time you encounter a new person you've just become part of a story ? 

everyone has their own life story , both past and present , and every time two or more interact , they become part of each others' story ( not necessarily an important or even significant part , but a part nevertheless ) . 

that seems to be the basic theory behind `go , ' where several characters' chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways . 

in order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldn't usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them , such as a teenage supermarket cashier , a bottom-of-the-drug-food-chain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors . 

these types of characters might not sound all that original , but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father , a mid-level drug dealer , a narc obsessed with multi-level-marketing , horny wedding guests , a zen lovemaker , two shrimp-scarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out . 

how they will all come together is the process the film deals with . 

i'd imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators' testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general . 

the film starts out as anything else , with little indication of what's to come . 

we meet ronna ( polley ) , a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn't seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent . 

she's not very charming , especially to her customers , but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works . 

maybe this is because she's not a very afeminite character , but she's far from masculine - a creative character indeed . 

things start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours of the goofy , hyperactive , yet likable simon ( askew ) , an english teen into vices for the sake of the experiences . 

this agreement starts a three-pronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug . 

the process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death . 

nearly the same can be said for two other characters , zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) , who we don't think much of when they first appear as supporting characters , but later will become major players to the film's makeup - another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be . 

once the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle . 

when the title screen `ronna' is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene , it's clear this film isn't going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling . 

considering how good it is up until that point , it's a long overdue change of pace needed in movies today . 

and so the film begins to take shape , first by following ronna and her friends on a one-night adventure that begins with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam ( who were actually looking for simon ) , which doesn't exactly go as planned , but that's what keeps it all so interesting . 

the second storyline starts at the same moment as ronna's story , but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead . 

simon and his three friends head to ? vegas for a night on the town and in the process experience things they never would have imagined . 

the third arc , about zack and adam , again overlaps with ronna's story telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle . 

we're shown things we never would have expected were going on while following ronna . 

and many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam aren't even their fault - they just happened to be where they were when they were . 

i'd really like to dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the film wraps up in the end , but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who haven't seen the film . 

perhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and unpredictability , and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay , just through great filmmaking . 

still , i can list and analyze nearly everything the film does so well : 

 ? direction : trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task and for a rookie filmmaker such as liman , it's a great accomplishment . 

he doesn't just depict a story , he wraps us up in it all , pulling us into the fray so that we experience every high and low . 

 ? screenplay : besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general , it's clear the script has been inspired by many sources , with both obvious and subtle references , yet it never screams `rip-off . ' 

 ? tone/mood : where other hollywood films have failed to bring the charm of the independents to the mainstream , this one is able to create its own sense of the macabre . 

it's not overly-dark or twisted and the comedy isn't so satirical for it to be considered a black comedy , more like `macabre light . ' 

 ? cinematography/art direction : able to photograph both the intense and the lighthearted in the same manner . 

 ? characterization : for nearly every character introduced , no matter what role they play in the big picture , we're able to get a sense of who they are , what they're thinking and how they came to be in their situations . 

even when their actions are surprising , it never seems very out of synch . 

 ? performances : every actor nails their role ( see above ) . 

 ? theme/theory : the film doesn't seem to be concerned with conveying any kind of political or social messages , instead , it's more of a philosophical experiment . 

in fact , it might not have meant to do that intentionally , but there definitely is something existential to it all . 

 . . . and to think that `go' is just a big comedy and adventure ! 

 ( 4/23/99 ) [see also : `the big lebowski , ' `clerks , ' `jackie brown , ' `pulp fiction , ' `true romance ; ' also by liman : `swingers']

"blade is the movie that shows that wesley snipes really can live up to his potential as one of hollywood's premier leading men . 

blade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel to it . 

it is a very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well . 

although , at a few points i thought i was watching a music video as opposed to a movie . 

the ideas behind blade are good , as is the basic plot of the story . 

but at times , things seem to get a bit muddled , and the writers appear to want to do too many things at once . 

that really doesn't take away from the story too much , but it does hurt it a little bit . 

blade ( snipes ) is half man , half vampire . 

his mother was bitten by a vampire when she was pregnant with him and as a result he has many of the classic traits of a vampire . 

including a thirst for human blood that must be kept under control by a special serum which quenches his blood lust . 

blade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as a sort of revenge for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother . 

but this isn't as easy as it seems , because the vampires in blade's world are more sophisticated than the ones that you find in most films . 

the government and other authorities know of the existence of vampires , but they let them feast of the population at large because they are taking bribes from the vampires . 

where do vampires get money ? 

well , in blade , they run multinational companies in order to finance their vampire organizations . 

i personally thought that this whole secret corporate world run by vampires to be a very clever idea , and a great addition to the movie . 

blade runs up against the evil deacon frost ( stephen dorff ) a maverick in the vampire community . 

he isn't content to live among humans , and is convinced that the vampire race is the superior one and he means to insure its superiority . 

he has managed to translate the ancient vampire scrolls that tell of the method of making him an all-powerful vampire -- rendering him virtually unstoppable . 

it's up to blade to see that this doesn't transpire . 

admittedly , blade is style over substance through and through . 

the story is a relatively forgettable one , but it is fun none the less . 

the acting in blade is just about what you would expect from a movie of this type . 

this isn't a film that is going to win accolades for its performances , and the actors know this . 

the movie is played for fun and nobody seems to think otherwise . 

it's a popcorn movie , and no one involved has any illusions otherwise . 

blade's production values are as slick as any that you will find in your typical summer blockbuster . 

the combat sequences between blade and his vampire targets are incredibly well done . 

although , the mtv-style cuts did get on my nerves after a while during long sequences . 

blade is a fun movie with an interesting take on the vampire genre . 

this is not the movie for those of you who like your vampires in tuxedos and living in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle . 

what blade excels at is bringing the classic lore of the vampire into the next century with a fresh outlook on life . 

very cool . 
"
"this well-conceived but ultra sugary coming-of-age film is not for everyone , and i include myself as one of those who found it too sappy for my digestion . 

joseph cross ( joshua beal ) is a 10-year-old who is saddened by the recent loss of his grandfather ( loggia ) to bone marrow cancer . 

loggia is wonderful in relating to the child in such a wholesome manner , it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup . 

the beals are like a sitcom idyllic family , where everyone is just so nice and affluent , and properly religious without being fanatical . 

the beals , the father ( denis leary ) and his wife ( dana delany ) , are both successful doctors ; julia stiles plays joshua's older sister , needling her younger brother but also showing that she really cares about him . 

this is a family seemingly conceived in heaven , but living in south philadelphia , sending their children to a well-run catholic school . 

joshua , the protagonist and the narrator of this yarn , is a handsome , sweet , intelligent , friendly , and endearing child , who does well in school , relates to the nuns and priests , and talks politely to his well-meaning parents . 

all this mawkish interplay makes it almost too nauseating to watch . 

the plot arises when joseph has a problem coping with the death of his beloved grandfather , who promised to be with him forever . 

his answer is to search for god , pretty heady stuff for a youngster his age to do , but that's just the way it is , sometimes . 

this search for god takes us nowhere because , as his friend david ( reifsnyder ) says , where can you look for him if he doesn't exist . 

now , that's a smart kid . 

but joseph looks for him in the usual places , and what better place than to start in the parochial school he attends . 

one of his teachers is the kind-hearted sister terry ( rosie o'donnell ) , who wears a philly baseball hat and equates the jesus stories with baseball , making him the clean-up hitter , and in my opinion , if she wasn't a big tv star , would have a vocation as a parochial school teacher , she is that convincing . 

throughout the film , she is saved from answering any tough ( sic ! ) 

question about god by the bell , as it rings to end the class . 

nothing much happens in the search for god , there is no parody of the catholic school ; though a visiting cardinal is found by the boy not to be able to talk to god , but this is gentle stuff , no real criticism or search for god is attempted . 

what comes next into play is some hollywood hokum , which is designed not to upset anyone , as joseph has a reassuring encounter with a real , live angel , a blond little boy his own age and dressed like him in the catholic school uniform who wears the innocuous smile of a goody-goody . 

the film ends as this angel ( ! ! ! ) 

tells him his grandfather is all right . 

his quest is ended , as apparently angels don't have wings and are approachable ; and god , well , . . . 

maybe that's for another film down the road . 

this part of the film was the final straw for me , i couldn't swallow any more goo . 

as this film flopped commercially , his next one , the sixth sense , pared down the schmaltz and came up smelling like a rose . 

though if you look through the cleverness of both scripts , this director is loaded with hokum , all he has learned how to do , is hide the hokum better . 

well , god bless him , if he can do that . 

this is a nice family picture and there is room for it in hollywood . 

it's just too bad that it had nothing relevent or even truthful to say about death , children in a parochial elementary school , or for that matter , about god . 

and that family of his , they're too good for words . 

yet the film meant well and its benign message had its heart in the right place . 

for those who want to see something soft , without a bite to it , this is the one . 
"
"there isn't much good about this movie . 

not much i can say about the acting , directing , or writing that would make you consider seeing this movie . 

so i'll get my one good comment out of the way , at least joel schuemacher ( batman & robin ) didn't direct it or it would be titled "" technicolor city "" . 

in fact there is nothing colorful about this movie , its dark and depressingly gloomy right down to the bitter end . 

the plot has a tendency to be interesting , but all that passes while your laughing at the ridiculous things thrown into what could have been a fascinating movie . 

the plot is impossible to explain due to how senseless it gets , so i will just touch on the bare minimum . 

john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) awakes in the bathtub of a cheap hotel , only to find out he has forgotten everything . 

john must find out who he is before the "" strangers "" ( a . k . a . 

mind erasing aliens ) find him and use him for their own evil conspiracy . 

during the film some interesting points are raised about human individuality , and the existence of inherently evil people . 

any of these points however are completely "" erased "" from your mind as you watch the actors stumble through the dreadful script . 

as i mentioned earlier , nothing but the atmosphere is right in this film . 

the acting is bland , and since there is virtually no character development no one seems to care . 

the special effects are low budget and some even hilariously fake , a sign of a true "" b-movie "" . 

the direction is poor and there is little continuity , not that you would expect it in a movie switching realities constantly . 

lastly the script is weak and has no concept of reality , and doesn't deserve to have the word "" science "" in science-fiction . 

if i haven't got my point across , i'll say it more plainly : this is a bad movie . 

lets hope the next movie by alex "" i wish i was tim burton "" proyas is at least tolerable . 
"
"for those who associate italian cinema with fellini and "" high art , "" the son's room is an inventive , subtle alternative . 

written by , directed , and starring nanni moretti , it takes us through the slow , complicated path of bereavement . 

slow is the best description for the film at first . 

it takes its time in establishing the habits of what appears to be a normal , happy family . 

father and mother both work but still find the time to support their son and daughter through homework and after school activities . 

they laugh , spend free time together , and reprimand the kids for innocent wrongs with a sigh and soft pat on the shoulder . 

you get the feeling there is open communication and unconditional love amongst the foursome . 

but suddenly , the son is found to be dead after a diving accident . 

the family dynamics begin an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative strength when you least expect it , but can also be trying on the attention span . 

though the film drags and even repeats itself , this can be somewhat excused as influenced by the process of grieving . 

though nanni moretti wore several hats for this production , it doesn't come across as a vanity piece . 

one might wish he hadn't picked the profession of analyst for the father , giovanni ( which he stars as ) , if only because this makes his character's reactions so predictable . 

what saves it is a well written script , with spare dialogue and an eclectic variety of human interaction . 

the potency of the film lies in the recreation of the tiny details of everyday life that alter due to the death of a close relative , or that remind a depressed person of loss . 

you start to take notice of the cracked dishes , ignored when familial bliss was in full swing . 

you remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block , and not necessarily huge events like graduation . 

even better are the role reversals that take place within the household . 

while giovanni and paola ( laura morante ) do check up on their daughter irene ( jasmine trinca ) , there is a sense of being on autopilot . 

not only does irene begin to take care of her own needs more , she'll make her parents breakfast in an attempt to crack their new shells to life around them . 

these scenes provide interesting portrayals of various coping mechanisms , frequently crossing a boundary as to how much you can help yourself versus others during drastic , unexpected change . 

respectfully , gender issues never enter the picture . 

self-propelled isolation is universal in terms of dealing , so moretti intelligently uses this tool to separate the family . 

though giovanni does stop paolo from discussing andrea at a party with friends , there is never a sense that he or she is more stoic , or more correct in the search to restore a sense of a balance to their lives . 

most films that broach the topic of death utilize annoying melodrama , speeches , and conciliatory issues to get the waterworks flowing . 

in contrast , the son's room captures a more realistic depiction of the effects of death on a family by graciously flowing among the five stages of mourning ( denial , depression , anger , bargaining , acceptance ) through each of its main characters . 

it's not the most engaging 100 minutes , but it is certainly easy to relate to .

"summer movies are , by nature , dumb affairs that are usually made for some quick enjoyment and to make money . 

wild wild west , the latest will smith affair , follows much the same formula , except that it is dumber and less enjoying than most summer movies . 

will smith plays jim west , a black sheriff with a nice line in sunglasses . 

he is called by president grant ( kline ) to go on a mission to find out why top government scientists are disappearing . 

west is paired up with scientist artemus gordon ( kline again ) and the two track the missing scientists to a legless mastermind , named dr . loveless ( branagh , with a zany moustache . ) 

before i pile on with the many negatives in this sorry affair , i'll give it a chance with the positives . 

there's a nice credit sequence , the production design by bo welch is pleasing to the eye , and the special effects are decent enough . 

there's also a pleasant soundtrack . 

buried deep in the dross are one or two amusing jokes . 

and salma hayek pops up as the female interest , which is always nice to see . 

apart from these factors , though , nothing else in wild wild west works . 

firstly , there's little chemistry between smith and kline , who appears to be in it purely for the money . 

one would expect zingers passing between the two : none arise . 

both of them plod through the below standard plot , knowing that there is a pay cheque waiting at the end . 

not even kenneth branagh provides much entertainment : although he is over the top , the material doesn't present much opportunity for branagh to be truly crazy . 

therefore , he just comes across as loud as obnoxious . 

the only enjoyable performance comes from the sexy salma hayek , who is given so little screen time it's embarrassing . 

she appears to be in the film to merely show off her body , and be ogled at by kline and smith . 

her character also changes at a whim to fit the mechanics of the script , and there is no sense of realism about the character . 

the 'humour' in the film is also very off . 

will smith put a little spin to his daft lines in men in black , here , not even smith could save the humour on display . 

the script largely boils down to insults that aren't very funny , and one-liners that barely raise a smirk . 

it's also somewhat racist , although it doesn't intend to be , with one scene with jim west trying to wisecrack his way out of a lynching , and actually says slavery is good to save himself . 

it's not a funny scene , and the whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably . 

the film also makes the tragic mistake that a man ( in this case kline ) in a dress is automatically unfunny , it isn't , but the wild wild west makes this joke even more painful to watch through pure ineptness . 

there's also problems with the plot . 

jim west and artemus gordon get caught up in all kinds of sticky situations , but the way they get out of them are always unsatisfying , and rely purely on luck , rather than audience pleasing skill . 

plot elements are introduced into the film , and then thrown away just as quickly . 

the main piece of the story , a 80 foot mechanical , steam driven spider devised by loveless looks rather impressive , but there's no particular reason why it should be built . 

why not loveless build a great big tank , instead of an ungainly , fragile piece of machinery that's just begging to be blown up ? 

director barry sonnenfeld always has a breezy look to them , with some nice camera tricks , but even this is missing from this stilted affair . 

wild wild west could have benefited from sonnenfelds whacked out style of directing , but not much of it is evident , making this film drag out even more . 

it's a sad thing when _four_ ( credited ) screenwriters , a talented director and a willing star can't make a film work , and eventually wild wild west collapses under it's sexist , mildly racist , unfunny weight .

she owns a quaint little children's bookstore , he owns one of those gigantic super-bookstores that offer impersonal service and discount prices . 

while his store threatens to run her store out of business , their online relationship grows stronger . 

 "" you've got mail "" is as artificial as movies come . 

everything is nice and happy and by the end , all the characters have gotten exactly what they wanted out of life . 

there are no real conflicts , no major disappointments , no unresolved issues . 

nevertheless , i quite enjoyed it . 

in fact , i can't remember the last time i had such a good time at the movies . 

i think sometimes you have to be able to watch a movie and just get drawn into it . 

the fact that stars hank and ryan are at the top of their game does not hurt either . 

in particular , hanks is at his best here , turning his "" charm-meter "" up to 11 . 

everytime he was on screen , he had my full attention . 

and despite the fact that he was driving little bookstores out of business , i was rooting for him . 

it was good to see hanks back doing what he does best : playing the affable everyman . 

 "" you've got mail "" certainly won't be winning any awards , but as an exercise in pure entertainment , it's as good as it gets .

"because no one demanded it : david duchovny in a romantic comedy ! 

at last , both his romantic magnetism and his comedic brilliance are mined for all their resources ! 

the choice of duchovny may have something to do with the plot , which could be fodder for a valentine's day episode of "" the x-files . "" 

bob rueland ( david duchovny ) loses his wife elizabeth ( joely richardson ) in a car accident . 

at the same time , grace briggs ( minnie driver ) is in the hospital , waiting for a heart transplant . 

grace gets elizabeth's heart , and it leads her to bob . 

it's the romantic equivalent of all those horror films where someone gets a transplant from a serial killer and then is driven to slaughter people . 

four writers are credited with contributing to the story . 

that doesn't seem possible . 

despite being a solid two hours long , "" return to me "" adds little to the "" boy meets girl / boy loses girl "" formula and , as a result , is terribly tedious and slow-moving . 

duchovny and driver seem unable to generate any sparks , and i kept wishing for a fast-forward button to move their scenes along . 

since driver has managed to work well in romantic roles before , i blame duchovny . 

he's out of his element without the manufactured and static sexual tension of his tv series ( and i've always thought that the relationship between mulder and scully on "" the x-files "" comes off more sibling-like than hot-and-bothered ) . 

there's something about duchovny that makes me uneasy . 

regardless of the role he's playing , he comes off as a weirdo . 

the only redeeming quality of "" return to me "" is its hilarious supporting cast . 

the circle of friends and relatives around bob and grace is constantly playing matchmaker , and they generate the only laughs in the movie . 

carroll o'connor is grace's grandfather marty o'reilly . 

when bob comes into marty's restaurant after hours , marty immediately begins quizzing bob about his marital status . 

when marty discovers that bob is a widower , he invites bob to join his poker game and introduces him with the declaration , "" this is bob ! 

his wife is dead ! "" 

the poker buddies are just as desperate to find a mate for grace and greet bob enthusiastically when they hear the news . 

also funny : bonnie hunt as grace's best friend megan and james belushi as megan's husband joe . 

married with children , megan and joe provide a useful counterpoint by showing the mundane results of romance . 

although it's rare to see him in a movie that premieres in a theater , belushi delivers his lines with great comic skill . 

rounding out the impressive supporting cast are david alan grier as bob's best friend and robert loggia as marty's brother-in-law angelo . 

in only the lead actors lived up to the standards set by the rest of the cast . 

bottom line : if you are compelled to see this movie , watch it on video so you can fast-forward to scenes with carroll o'connor and james belushi .

"when robert forster found himself famous again after appearing in "" jackie brown "" , he immediately signed up for a little film called "" american perfekt "" . 

this was almost two years ago . 

i waited patiently for the film to be released , but it never was . 

finally , i forgot about it . 

the other day , though , while i was perusing the selection of the local video store , i stumbled upon , you guessed it , "" american perfekt "" . 

i immediately rented it and with a certain amount of glee , rushed home to view it . 

having now seen the film , i understand why it never saw theatrical release . 

 "" american perfekt "" is a jumbled mess . 

the storyline is non-existent . 

it took me half the movie just to figure out what was going on . 

and at that point , the only thing i really knew for sure was that the movie was * never * going to introduce a plot of some sort . 

it wants to get by on quirkyness and so-called charm alone , and it just doesn't work . 

robert forster plays a psychiatrist who picks up amanda plummer , and they head off on the road together . 

along the way to no discernable destination , they run into all sorts of kooky and wacky characters . 

i suppose this free-wheeling , no plot style is supposed to give the film an element of danger and excitment , but all it did was make me sleepy . 

i'm all for trying new things within the realm of film , but not at the expense of coherence . 

nothing in this movie makes sense . 

the actions of the characters go unexplained , even when they're truly bizarre . 

i'll give you an example , without giving too much away . 

david thewlis has a part as a drifting con-man . 

at one point , mid-way through the movie , he runs forster and plummer off the road with his car . 

as he passes them , we see that his face is covered in blood . 

do you think we would get an explanation as to what happened to him ? 

you would think so , wouldn't you . 

 "" american perfekt "" is a waste of time . 

nothing is gained from watching this movie , except maybe a migraine . 

and if you do rent it , don't bother trying to figure out what's going on in the hopes that everything will be resolved by the end . 

this doesn't happen . 

and no explanation is given for the misspelling of "" perfect "" , either .

"plot : jet li is a chinese cop asked to help some french policemen nab a bad guy . 

but one thing leads to another , and the next thing you know , li's being chased by the same french cops with whom he was supposed to be working . 

a lot of ass-kicking , face-whippings , gun fights and . . . okay , a little more ass-kicking ensues . 

critique : very cool ! 

now here's a movie that gives you exactly what you're looking for , if what you're looking for is kickass action , a palpable good cop/bad cop story line , some hardcore stunts and jet li slam-dunking everyone in sight ! 

the film also moves fast ( a mere 95 minutes ) , develops a certain "" cute "" chemistry between fonda and li , has nice surroundings ( paris , baby ! ) and gives us one of the best bad guys that i've seen all year . 

tcheky karyo is the devil incarnate in this film . 

he is pure evil . 

they should have called this movie bad lieutenant 2 as keitel has nothing on this man . 

what a great , great monster ! 

my favorite line of tcheky's was when li was explaining the whole "" kiss of the dragon "" thing to him and he cut him off by saying "" kiss my ass ! "" 

pure action movie poetry . 

anyway , other than him , jet li also handled his "" acting "" pretty well in this film , with very little real dialogue to say , but enough to make us believe his character . 

actually , just looking into the man's eyes generally tells you a lot . 

fonda was also pretty good , despite playing one of the most trashy and abused women that i have seen in quite some time , but i still felt kinda bad for her , so i guess she did her job okay . 

but in the end , nobody goes to see this kind of movie for oscar performances . 

we go to see jet li movies because we want to see jet li kicking a lot of ass from side to side , and this film delivers gangbusters on that front . 

and yes . . . they have no wire-fu in this movie . . . i 

say again . . . no 

wire-work , no bullshit stunts with li floating around in mid-air for over a minute . 

it's all straight action , fist to fist , boot to face and all around cool stunts . 

if that's what you're looking for , i don't see how you will be disappointed with this film . 

yes , it's not very original in plot ( just take luc besson's own la femme nikita and mix in plenty of his own the professional et voila ! ) , does have an annoying hip-hoppy soundtrack that just got on my nerves after a while ( i also would have gotten rid of the whole acupuncture thang . . . ) and will have anyone not willing to restrain their disbelief , rolling their eyes all over the place . 

but was i entertained ? 

thoroughly . 

does the film feature more gunplay , martial arts and over-the-top kills that most recent action flicks ? 

yes , again . 

does this sound interesting to you ? 

well , the answer to that question is entirely up to you . 

one thing that i would definitely recommend is , as jet li pointed out himself on his website , that you leave the kids at home for this one . 

in fact , you might even wanna leave yourself if you can't handle the more violent of sequences . 

all in all , a rippin' , roarin' fun time ! 

where's joblo coming from ? 

black mask ( 5/10 ) - blade ( 7/10 ) - la femme nikita ( 8/10 ) - lethal weapon 4 ( 7/10 ) - the matrix ( 8/10 ) - the professional ( 9/10 ) - romeo must die ( 3/10 ) - rush hour ( 7/10 ) - shanghai noon ( 6/10 )

"starring arnold schwarzenegger ; danny devito ; emma thompson & frank langella the only thing that you can say about junior is that it is a disappointment , and a big one at that . 

junior brings together arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito with director ivan reitman . 

these are the same men that brought us the very funny twins . 

so foolish me , i was hoping for something that would at least come close to the level of quality of twins . 

so much for hopes . 

schwarzenegger and devito play two scientists ( doctors hesse and arbogast ) who are working on a new drug that will reduce the possibility of miscarriage in pregnancy . 

unfortunately , due to circumstances beyond their control , they are denied permission to test this new drug on humans , and subsequently lose their funding . 

still believing that their drug will work , they decide to test it anyway , on hesse . 

so , dr . hesse ( schwarzenegger ) artificially inseminates himself and begins taking the drug . 

their theory is that if the drug can prevent a man from miscarrying , surely it will work on a woman . 

does the thought of arnold schwarzenegger pregnant sound funny or humorous to you ? 

well , it must have to the producers of junior . 

admittedly , schwarzenegger has the comedic talent to pull it off . 

perhaps if it had been done differently it might have actually been funny . 

but it wasn't , schwarzenegger pregnant is goofy at best . 

the sight of schwarzenegger running around going through the hormone imbalances that come with pregnancy , and the accompanying emotional swings , is not funny . 

schwarzenegger comes very close to embarrassing himself with these antics . 

i kept thinking to myself , with the time arnold wasted making this turkey he could have been making an action picture . 

better yet , with schwarzenegger , devito and reitman all in the same place at the same time , why didn't they make a sequel to twins ? 

anything would have been better than this mess . 

danny devito is wasted in this movie . 

his part could have been played by any joker they pulled in off the street . 

 ( after seeing the movie , if i was devito , i probably would have wished they had pulled someone in off the street . ) 

emma thompson is wasted here as well . 

while thompson is best known for her jane austin adaptations , she is also a fine comedian . 

too bad she didn't get to use any of that talent here . 

am i being too hard on this film ? 

i don't think so . 

schwarzenegger and devito are two of my favorite actors in film today , and ivan reitman is one of the more talented directors in hollywood . 

with a supporting cast of emma thompson and frank langella , the filmmakers really have to be trying hard to make a bad film . 

they certainly managed here . 

maybe it was well intentioned , but unfortunately this is a movie that never should have been made . 

if you are tempted to see this film , do yourself a favor and go rent twins , a film that truly takes advantage of arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito's comedic talents . 
"
"oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we have been munundated with ! 

in a perfect world , "" a civil action "" would be a breath of fresh air . 

it's cynical about lawyers in a way that grisham isn't . 

it's romantic in the exact opposite way a grisham book/film isn't . 

and , the capper , it has no distinct ending , and the law in hollywood films is that above all else , you must have an ending . 

even if it's based on a true story , a true story which hasn't yet ended , you must supply an ending , a false one , but an ending nevertheless . 

hell , "" a civil action "" is even more sly and more witty than any of the grisham works put together ( and that includes "" the firm , "" the only novel of his that will ever be regarded as a classic ) . 

yet it's also oddly and slightly unsatisfying . 

weird . 

this is , in fact , a steve zallian film , not just the work of a hack , and zallian is the director of the much-admired "" search for bobby fischer "" ( didn't see it ) and writer of none other than "" schindler's list . "" 

in short , i like this guy , and am a sucker for the way he tells his stories . 

after all , apart from the obvious it's-a-holocaust-film and it's-a-spielberg-film , isn't "" schindler's list "" just a damn brilliant film , not so much a holocaust film as it is a wonderful character study . 

 "" a civil action "" is the same way : it's narrative is split between being a lawyer film and being a character study . 

and it's here that the film seems to go a bit wrong . 

the main complaint of this film is that while , yes , it's an engrossing lawyerly tale , it has no real ending , and that's not necessarily the problem with the film . 

it's that it's just kind of unsatisfying . 

if this were a great film , it would feel complete , and still end basically the same way . 

but this film just seems to end , and i don't want to be stupid and suggest an alternate ending should be tacked on : imagine , if you will , being one of those the film is about , looking forward to this film , and then discovered the truth has been through a surrealistic and unpleasant hollywood filter , just so the many won't bitch about what is , essentially , genuine . 

but the fact that it just ends is not , in all actuality , what is wrong with it . 

it's rather that zallian has chosen , in the last half hour , to adandon the traditional lawyer story , and chose the other part of his story , the one about the lawyer , one jan schlictman ( john travolta ) , who's shown in the opening and throughout most of the movie as a heartless but brilliant lawyer , brilliant because he's manipulative and he always wins . 

it wishes to make it all about jan in the end , but the truth is , his change , although nicely done , is not full . 

we see him suffering from a personal crisis , and travolta does do a pretty good job in depicting his change of heart , but in the end , we don't fully believe it . 

and i think that the problem is when he has made his decision , the film choses an odd angle to go at , a noble one , but one that gives the film's conclusion that of incompleteness . 

in the opening of the film , we see him doing his old schtick , manipulating courts , winning cases effortlessly , and then discussing on a heard radio interview how great he is at his job and how much he cares for his cases . 

in short , he's full of bullshit and we know it . 

in the film , he takes a case that is hardly desired : a town where several of the children have died mysteriously of lukemia and the source of the illness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste into the river . 

point one , it's not of the usual criteria ( jan points out , wickedly , that dead or wounded children aren't nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success ) . 

point two , it has been through several lawyers . 

after turning them down , jan changes his mind ( a muddled scene - he stops his car on a bridge , looks out . . . is he feeling a sense of overachievement ? ) , and he and his team of lawyers ( tony shalhoub , zeljko ivanek , and accountant william h . macy ) head out to the town to do battle with the town's company . 

they spend millions of dollars examining the land , test the water , what have you ( this is where stephen fry , a possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in "" wilde , "" pops up thanklessly ) , and in the meantime question the parents of the dead children , and then , unsuccessfully , the workers at the plant . 

they also find themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer for the company , the eccentric jerome facher , played by robert duvall ( more on him later on ) . 

as we progress , we get so involved in the way the story is being told , which is engulfing everything around it , including the individual and brief stories of some of the townspeople ( one of the best is a bit with james gandolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland , who lost her child , who begins to have a personal crisis ) . 

things begin to go downhill for the lawyers in the second half , as they are up against impossible odds : the judge ( john lithgow ) is not only a strickler , but a pal of facher ; the employees of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testify ; no concrete evidence is being found , depsite the money spent to find it ; and they are quickly running out of money . 

as macy mortgages everything he can , including their homes and their office , he slowly loses his sanity ( his meatiest role since , oh , "" fargo "" ) , and we the audience begin to feel a real loss of hope for our protagonist . 

in fact , the last half hour is such a change from the rest of the film and so unresolved that it has been widely panned as not being up to par ( owen gleiberman , especially , criticized the film for not being overly-dramatic . . . i 

suppose like a grisham novel ) . 

this wouldn't be so if the change in jan had not been handled the way it is : instead of having a change of heart and automatically being perceived as good , he's seen as being still full of bullshit . 

because he doesn't take stock in the cares of his partners , and causes them all to lose their money and noteriaty in the lawyer field because he wants to help the people of the town , he is instead seen as being of good nature but not sure how to bring that out . 

the final half tries to redeem this , as must have been the point of making this in zallian's mind , but what follows is a series of scenes where we merely see him making personal stands for his beliefs , and though he has changed considerably from the opening moments when he's seen speeding back and forth from the town that wishes to employ him ( and thusly receiving two speeding tickets ) , we still feel that the big change in his life is that he's not rich and esteemed anymore ( the film's final title card is witty but in all actuality shallow ) . 

the fault is not that there is no closure to the court case ( it's still going on , you know ) , but that its personal story feels like it needs either another chapter or another angle in the final one it has . 

we need to feel like the character has really made a big change in his life , and that the story is how a story of strife like the one of the town could inspire such a whopping change in his personal life . 

it only feels like half of that . 

maybe even less . 

and it's not travolta , who does a great job here ( though never to be a truly memorable performance of his ) , but rather zallian , whose final chapter needs a rewrite . 

up to then , though , it's an engrossing drama , one of the best of the year in fact , and one of the best lawyer films , period . 

the reason is because it recognizes that a court trial is not about those being defended or prosecuted , but rather it's about the lawyers , the knights who battle eachother . 

we learn that the company is almost positively to blame for the deaths in the town , but the reason it can't be blamed is because it has the best prosecution you can find . 

and duvall's facher is such a brilliant character and he does such a magnificent job at portraying that man that it's almost easy to overlook how subtley great he is . 

facher is seen as an elderly man , a goofy eccentric , carrying a broken brown bag with stickers on it , eating lunches out of paper bags , and making a point to take time out of his day to listen to the radio , and scold anyone who interupts him . 

but look deeper and you see a master at work : his evil and manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities that others don upon him , and it's difficult as hell to clearly generalize him in any way . 

that's why i liked this film : it's hard to put a pointer on . 

you can never see exactly where this film will land , and even when the credits roll , you still aren't sure what to make of it . 

call it the zallian effect . 

same thing happened with "" schindler's list "" ( not that i'm comparing oskar schindler to jan schlictman ) . 

each film is so greatly crafted that you can't help but get involved in its broad storytelling , interesting characters , and , most peculiarly , the wit that comes along with it . 

if only it felt totally complete ( like , say , "" schindler's list , "" though at this point it may be unfair to make comparisons between the two ) , it might have been one of the best films of the year , and along with that , a full breath of fresh air .

"mr . nice guy is the latest jackie chan film , so you should know what to expect . 

a weak plot , terrible dialogue , very little acting ability , but some jaw-dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile . 

however , mr . nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackie's best efforts , and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever . 

jackie chan plays , who else , jackie . 

this time out , he's a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show . 

not that it ever makes a difference in the plot . 

there are only two scenes of him cooking . 

for the rest of the film , somehow he mutates into jackie chan , supercop . 

it never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills . . . perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege ? 

a tv newswoman , diana ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) , covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo ( richard norton ) and a local gang of toughs , the demons . 

although she only has one camcorder , somehow the result is full of close-ups and multiple angles . . . hmmm , 

shades of broadcast news ? ? ? 

anyway , the goons discover diana , and will do anything to recover the tape . 

here lies another crucial flaw in the story : doesn't anyone realize you can copy a tape ? 

oh well , no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense . 

as luck would have it , diana runs across jackie , and , wouldn't you know it , jackie accidentally ends up with the tape . 

this leads to countless chase and/or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie . 

in a move apparently designed to woo american ( and other english-speaking ) audiences , the film uses english as its primary language . 

however , that doesn't mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackie's recent americanized releases . 

strangely , many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english , and poorly too . 

whether this is just a very bad case of looping , an effort to minimize accents , or a simple case of nostalgia , it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackie's dubbed films . 

the plot in mr . nice guy is negligible , merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons . 

but even though plots have always been second to the action in jackie's films , it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread . 

look , if you have jackie chan playing a chef , why not use that to your advantage ? 

watching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen , beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts . 

the action is a mixed bag here . 

there's really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackie's films . 

it takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site , apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan . 

the action in the film is neither jackie's best nor worst , but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes . 

the film's gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting . 

once or twice , it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence . 

but to slo-mo jackie running ? 

either this is a nod to the six-million dollar man , or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down . 

if you've seen all of jackie's films and are in need of another fix , go ahead and see mr . nice guy . 

however , if you're just in the mood for some good action , you'd be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work , such as supercop .

"in present day hanoi , three sisters reflect on their parents' relationship while trying to define their own in writer/director tran anh hung's ( "" the scent of green papaya "" ) "" the vertical ray of the sun . "" 

youngest sister lien ( tran nu yen-khe ) greets the day with hai ( ngo quanq hai ) , the only brother whom she rooms and relentlessly flirts with . 

their morning ritual of tai chi and lou reed precedes crossing the street to eldest sister suong's ( nguyen nhu quynh ) cafe , where lien works , for breakfast . 

the three sisters lovingly prepare their mother's memorial banquet of traditional delicacies , prepared as much for look as taste , while giggling over the differences between the sexes . 

after the family breaks from the banquet , we learn that suong's young son 'little monkey' is doted upon , but there's a distance developing with her husband quoc ( chu ngoc hung ) , who's leaving for one of his habitual botanical photography trips . 

middle sister khanh ( tran manh cuong ) tells her writer husband she's pregnant before he leaves on a trip to saigon to research tuan , a mysterious man in his mother-in-law's past . 

lien keeps crawling into hai's bed at night , causing him to fall out of it . 

the initial serenity we witnessed starts turning into a soap opera before coming to full circle one month later , as the three women prepare their father's memorial banquet . 

 "" the vertical ray of the sun "" is a contemplative piece where strong passions exist underneath calm exteriors . 

sly humor , self deceit and harsh truths all exist in the cyclic screenplay . 

tran anh hung and his cinematographer mark lee ping-bin ( "" flowers of shanghai "" ) linger over and repeat the small gestures of everyday life - a wife washes her husbands hands , a woman makes water dance in a bowl , a man pulls his lover to face him before they part . 

small spaces such as rooms , alleys and courtyards create intimacy . 

the color green , symbolizing life and tranquility , is used heavily in the film's visual styling , lapsing into yellowish hues and blues . 

writer/director tran anh hung's film recalls ang lee's "" eat drink man woman , "" another tale of three sisters of varying modernity coming together traditionally for a parent . 

but while lee's more traditionally story-driven film resulted in radical changes for all concerned , "" the vertical ray of the sun's "" characters strive for peaceful harmony . 

watching it is like trailing your fingertips in a stream on a cool spring day .

"for more than a decade , anjelica huston has been one of america's finest actresses . 

in her directorial debut , bastard out of carolina , based upon dorothy allison's largely autobiographical book on child abuse and poverty in the south , huston displays impressive proficiency behind the camera as well . 

the film tells the story of ruth anne boatwright , nicknamed bone by one of her uncles at birth , in post-world war ii south carolina . 

through voice-over ( narration done by laura dern ) , we find that she nearly didn't survive birth , as her single mother anney , played by jennifer jason leigh , was thrown through the windshield during an automobile accident . 

that's just the beginning of her troubles . 

bone is deemed illegitimate on her birth certificate , a social stigma which her mother and her large poor family obsesses over for years to come . 

anney meets and weds lyle , a kind man and good stepfather whom gives bone a baby sister before dying in an automobile accident . 

anney's brother earle , played by michael rooker , introduces her to glen , played by ron eldard , a co-worker at the mill . 

glen , the black sheep of a wealthy family ( "" when are you gonna make your daddy proud ? 

i'll tell you when - never ! "" 

he's told ) and filled with bitterness , courts anney and eventually wins her , despite warnings of a violent temper . 

when anney miscarries with his much-prized baby boy , glen loses his capability to supress his violent outbursts and begins to direct them at bone , beating and abusing her , while the love-dependent anney tries to turn a blind eye and justify his behaviour . 

things turn for the worse when glen loses his job and the family of four sink into impoverishment . 

while set several decades ago , this story remains completely relevant in today's society , where abused wives return to their husbands , and abuse committed against children by one spouse is routinely overlooked by the other . 

the real star of this domestic drama is not top-billed jennifer jason leigh , but child actress jena malone , who plays bone in a wrenching and wholly impressive debut performance . 

her work is of award-calibre , and in this age in which a preponderence of superb child performers have emerged ( kirsten dunst , tina majorino , anna paquin , natalie portman , christina ricci , elijah wood ) , malone's performance stands up well . 

leigh's performance in bastard out of carolina is fine , although she's not really given much to do , and ron eldard work is very solid , skillfully manouvering his character's moods in and out of explosive rage . 

one can always sense that underneath his glen is a pressure-cooker ticking away . 

of the supporting cast , special note must be made of the criminally underrated michael rooker's performance . 

there's a bit too much generic formulaism in the screenplay for my taste , from the various characters spouting off country bumpkinisms , to the familiar sight of a dried-up uptight wise old granny ( played by grace zabriskie ) sitting on the porch rocking chair , to impassioned soliloquies better suited for a stage performance . 

still , it cannot be denied that anne meredith's screenplay contains a wallop of emotional power . 

huston's direction of the film is surehanded and impressive , giving the film good pacing and eliciting good performances from her cast , particularly the young malone . 

her sequences of child abuse are shot in a hard-hitting emotional , rather than graphic , manner , and are very effective . 

huston's talent with camera positioning is wonderful , from a visually striking shot done through a fan , to an extended sequence in the front seat of an automobile . 

the film has the toned-down feel of a television production ; bastard out of carolina was originally composed and cut for broadcast on the tnt cable station , who ended up declining the film due to sentiments that scenes of abuse and rape in the film were too disturbingly realistic for their audience . 

perhaps some sequences of the film may be unpleasant , but as a whole bastard out of carolina adds up to a powerful viewer experience worth seeing .

on a return trip from new york where he was trying to get a job , dunne is in a horrible train accident that he is the only survivor of . 

to make things even stranger , dunne has also escaped the accident completely unscathed . 

a comic book art dealer named elijah price ( samuel l . jackson ) , who was born with a degenerative bone disease that causes his bones to be so brittle that they break constantly , has been seeking out someone like dunne his entire life . 

price felt that there had to be someone exactly the opposite of him . . . 

someone whose bones would be so strong that they would never break . 

price contacts dunne and convinces him to come down to his gallery for a talk where he suggests that dunne could quite possibly be something akin to a superhero from the comic books price used to read when he was a child . 

dunne doesn't believe him at first , but price assists him in discovering his "" powers "" and helps him hone his craft until he discovers what his true calling really is . 

writer/director m . night shyamalan had a tough act to follow with his sleeper hit the sixth sense . 

how exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years ? 

for shyamalan , the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners . 

does this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash , though ? 

the answer to that question is not a very easy one , either . 

as far as pacing goes , the sixth sense seemed almost interminable . 

it wasn't until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally ( and perfectly ) paced in order to give the audience ample time to re-connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached . 

for unbreakable , shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which , in many ways , blows away the film that had come before . 

the story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalan's direction is excellent , with the camera almost constantly moving . 

there are tons of great shots in the film , not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis' character and another train passenger . 

the shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak . 

also very impressive is the film's score by james newton howard ( who also scored shyamalan's sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes , as well as this year's dinosaur ) . 

several of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film . 

one of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to "" exercise "" his powers . 

the music , in combination with the stellar visuals , really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie . 

if there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year , this one would be it . 

the film also boasts some great performances , including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment . 

willis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne , who just can't seem to figure out why he's been depressed for the last few years . 

his character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him , but he eventually grows into his own under elijah's tutelage . 

jackson is one of the better actors of our time , and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah . 

though his hairstyle is absurd , jackson seems to infuse such a great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked . 

robin wright penn's role seems slightly underwritten , but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her character's need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again . 

spencer treat clark , as the dunne's young son jeremy , shows that shyamalan still has a knack for picking young actors , and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film . 

out of all the characters , jeremy's is perhaps the most emotional , and clark does a great job with the role . 

where the film does lose points though , is during its "" surprise "" ending . 

shyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense , but i found myself saying "" that was it ? ! "" 

when unbreakable revealed its own ending . 

it's not that the ending is bad , it's just that the ending doesn't quite have the emotional punch that the other film's did . 

plus , it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels ( and i won't reveal the ending here , but you'll understand what i mean when you see it ) . 

essentially , what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable . 

the only real problem is that the ending doesn't quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor . 

as long as it isn't held to the standard that sixth sense set ( which it ultimately will be ) , it should be a remarkably well liked film . 

one thing seems clear , though . 

shyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film .

"i'm an avid fan of the "" alien "" saga , so this review is obviously a tad biased ( at least i admitted it ) . 

of course , that doesn't mean that i'm gonna be giving this a four-star review or something , because "" alien : resurrection , "" the fourth film in the cool-as-hell series is not an absolutely amazing film , much like the first two were . 

however , it's a very good film which never fails to entertain , and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series . 

in short , i had a good time . 

 "" alien : resurrection "" leaves off 200 years after the last one , where our heroine protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , the science fiction genre's answer to job , had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body , waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one . 

of course , the last one wasn't very great or anything ( i liked it , though not as much as the first two ) , and more importantly , it wasn't financially successful ( a tawdry 55 million bucks ! ) . 

so back we are , with ripley back as a clone , which means we get another little satirical look at cloning ( not that that's a bad thing , but it's becoming a cliche ) . 

so she's cloned aboard an even more futuristic-looking ship called "" the auriga "" by some doctors ( including the necessary bad government guy , dr . wren , played by j . e . freeman , as well as the little-seen dr . gediman , played by none other than brad douriff ) , mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her . 

once you get past the fact that you can't figure out where they got her blood ( although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one ) , the film's okay . 

also on board are a band of mercenary pirates , including michael wincott , ron perlman , kim flowers , raymond cruz , dominique pinon ( a jeunet sytable ) and . . . winona ryder , who plays analee call , who turns out to have a bit of a secret ( i won't state it , but unless you've been shacking up with salinger for the past two years , you probably know all about it - although it's nicely covered up ) . 

there's a bit of a non-sexual-yet-slightly-homoerotic relationship between her and ripley , but it's never really deepened enough . 

oh well . 

well , as you might have guessed , the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship . 

and it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship ( including some shocks - dan hedaya , for instance , who's death is comical yet sad since , well , he's dan hedaya ) , and the remaining people ( about 7 or 8 ) are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth . 

of course , the plot is all balderdash , and just an excuse for some good old "" alien "" -brand fun . 

the real focus of the series seems to be on style , not really substance ( although there's always a bit of it , most notably in "" aliens "" with the relationship between ripley and the little girl ) . 

what's interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach . 

 "" alien "" is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights . 

 "" aliens "" is a wild , tense thriller . 

 "" alien 3 "" is a bleak , moody piece of semi-noir . 

 "" alien 4 "" is kind of like an off-beat french film , filled with lots of humor , and cool scares . 

jean-pierre jeunet ( without his usual directing partner , marc caro ) creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like "" das boot "" has , with echoes hinting at a possible threat . 

the chills in the film are really cool , especially with the music , which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes ( there's the most tense surgery scene since "" face/off "" towards the beginning ) . 

and not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that . 

this all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others . 

there are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed . 

one is the aforementioned surgery scene . 

another one takes place between call and ripley , which is just awesome . 

the underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense , thrilling , and jaw-dropping scenes in the entire saga ( with a small allusion to jeunet's earlier film , "" delicatessen "" ) . 

and the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool ( with a lovely allusion to "" goldfinger "" ) . 

but the best scene in the entire film ( i'm sure i'm not the first to mention it ) takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her ( she has a an "" 8 "" tatooed on her arm ) . 

it might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga . 

the screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work , as it never really deapens a lot of the characters . 

however , it does make us care about most of them , so that when there's very little of them , and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow , we are pretty scared . 

and , yeah , there are some very funny lines ( ripley : "" who do i have to fuck to get off this boat ? ! "" 

johner : "" well , i can get you off . 

but not this ship . "" ) 

the acting is good all around , with stand-out performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner , and leland orser ( the poor bastad in "" se7en "" who performed the "" lust "" sin ) as an anxiety-ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him . 

winona ryder is good , but not amazing like she usually is ( although she meshes well with the film ) . 

of course , and as usual , sigourney weaver steals the show . 

playing a variation on the ripley character ( less emotional , and more rude and bitter ) , she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable . 

she's not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for "" aliens , "" but she's just awesome . 

overall , it's a thrilling , entertaining film which doesn't really amaze like the first two , but is much more amazing than the third installment . 

the style is the best part of the film , which isn't really a bad thing , but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply . 

but it's entertaining as hell , and it's definitely fit for the "" alien "" series .

"wizards is an animated feature that begins with a narration of epic proportions . 

over black and white drawings , we are told that the earth is destroyed in an apocalyptic nuclear exchange , sending the remnants of humanity through generations of radiation-induced mutation . 

the "" original "" inhabitants of the earth , fairies and elves , return to populate the globe , along with their evil , mutant counterparts . 

one day ( and i say "" one day "" not to be trite , but because that's exactly how it happened - no advance notice ) , a fairy queen gives birth to twins , one good and one evil . 

the twins grow up to be powerful wizards , the good one embracing magic , and the bad one utilizing technology to attempt to expand his evil empire . 

we are given the notion that an ultimate battle must occur between the forces of magic and those of technology . 

as unoriginal as the premise is , i was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out . 

there's a lot you can do in an animated fantasy world , after all . 

i soon learned , however , that the fantasy was the expectation of a decent film . 

once the transition was made from still art to color animation , an entirely different feel takes precedence . 

rather than the epic saga promised by the narration , we get a goofy-looking world of a saturday morning cartoon . 

not just the look , mind you , but all the zany sounds like >honk boing 

for years , blackwolf has lost his battles against the magical forces of good , since his armies of ogres and other mutants would get dispirited or distracted soon after battle is joined . 

however , blackwolf now has a secret weapon : nazis . 

yup , adolf hitler , the luftwaffe and the wehrmacht . 

okay , not the real things , but an archival film his minions dug up . 

projected into the sky for all to see , it inspires his own army while shocking the enemy into submission long enough for the ogres to hack them up . 

before you know it , there are dead elves everywhere . 

this is just as well . 

the characters are so bad that the viewer doesn't care about any of them . 

they're either silly , sappy , or both . 

the dialog gets much of the credit for this . 

an example is when avatar nonchalantly says , "" well , looks like my brother and i begin our final battle . "" 

not very formidable when he's also the guy who says , "" this is the biggest bummer of a trip i've ever been on . "" 

my favorite line was from a sideline fairy who is asked by her child why good can't fight back against the nazi-charged evil . 

her response is , "" they have weapons and technology . 

we just have love . "" 

suffice to say , the characters are strictly two-dimensional , and we therefore don't expect anything more than the obvious to happen . 

which it does . 

the only unexpected occurrence is the way the final battle between brothers is played out , which is anticlimactic and disappointing . 

please note that it is the action that is unexpected . 

that it is disappointing is not . 

the film couldn't settle on a particular mood . 

it seems to move from dark to light with the cuts from scene to scene and even angle to angle . 

scenes which are seemingly meant to contain deep meaning are ruined by acts of levity . 

the dramatics , which seem to occur at random , are overly staged and overly acted , detracting from any kind of value or even enjoyment which could otherwise be gleaned . 

ralph bakshi , the director , makes an obvious attempt to get a message across in this film : hitler and the nazis were bad . 

so who doesn't know this already ? 

well , maybe children . 

okay , so you might say that this is a movie for children . 

it's not . 

in the scenes where good fights evil , there's a lot of violence and gore that children should not be seeing if they're watching a cartoon . 

so is the film for adults ? 

if so , we probably don't need to be bashed over the head to get the point . 

why not have the bad guys be symbolic of the nazis instead of using old propaganda in a seriously disjointed attempt to show us something we already know ? 

wizards gives us a lot of footage of nazi tanks and airplanes , and hitler giving speeches . 

however , we don't see any reason why they should be considered bad . 

we see no atrocities being committed , not even any real battle footage . 

there is absolutely no connection made between the armies of evil and the third reich , and we're not even given a cursory explanation as to why this stuff is inspiring in the first place . 

this needed to be thought out much more thoroughly if a point were to be made , since subject matter such as this deserves better treatment . 

i'd like to assume that bakshi was trying to say that the same nationalist movement that drove the nazis could happen anywhere , at any time , and we must therefore be vigilant . 

however , i'm not sure if i want to give him that much credit .

"the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber , the naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse , and a partnership that blossoms between the two are the fine components that make up a modest , little caper adventure entitled `where the money is . ' 

the elderly bank robber is henry ( paul newman ) , a famous criminal that was only recently caught . 

he has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune . 

always the shrewd thinker , he begins working on a plan to get out of jail . 

this involves years of studying buddhism and self-hypnosis . 

when he is prepared to execute his plan , he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke . 

now a seemingly twitching vegetable , he is temporarily transferred to a state-run home . 

carol ( linda fiorentino ) is the nurse that cares for him . 

she's a very bright person with a good heart . 

yet , her life is a miserable waste of time . 

the most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars . 

her days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics . 

worse , she's in a dead-end relationship with high-school sweetheart wayne ( dylan mcdermott ) . 

they became a couple because they were king and queen of the prom . 

to her , this made sense long ago . 

but now , it's a different story . 

wayne seems equally bored with his life , but is content enough to stay put . 

wayne's greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman . 

carol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients , but she's never been anywhere else and doesn't see many other opportunities in life . 

however , when henry falls under her care , her outlook begins to change . 

the medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke . 

carol , however , begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all . 

maybe she can get through to him , and maybe she can learn something about the money that he has stashed away . 

the opening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying to bring henry ? back to life . ' 

and what are some of carol's resuscitation techniques ? 

perhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses . 

if that fails , maybe she'll try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20-foot high pier into the cold lake below . 

when he finally comes out of his state of self-trance , the movie's direction changes , though it remains equally if not more entertaining . 

carol sees that henry is filled with charisma and self-assuredness . 

she is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy . 

this , of course , puts wayne in an odd situation . 

henry and carol's bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car . 

henry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash . 

meanwhile , this is carol's ticket to a better life . 

wayne is uncomfortable with the situation , but helps out nonetheless . 

however , his lack of commitment threatens their success . 

the heist sequence is suspenseful , well paced , and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong . 

`where the money is' does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist . 

newman is the real joy of the film , adroitly showing that at age 75 , he's still really hot stuff . 

he possesses a sly smile , displays a dominating attitude , and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive . 

fiorentino is also a fun presence . 

you root for her despite her sense of amorality . 

sure , she wants to commit robbery and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchair-stricken man into a lake , but we can see that to escape her dead-end world , she needs to do something drastic . 

with two charismatic characters such as these , it's hard to ignore that `where the money is' is where the fun is .

"jarvis cocker of pulp once said that he wrote common people after noticing mike leigh box-sets on the video shelves -- he had a feeling that economic deprivation was becoming a tourist experience for the well-off . 

maybe it's a classic case of displacement : it's easier to see jarvis' own lyrics ( obsessed with acrylic and wood chip on the wall ) as a fetishization of lowlife , rather than leigh's films . 

but it's worth being reminded that drab interiors and a couple of working-class characters don't make for a guarantee of 'authenticity' , let alone a good film . 

it's the triumph of secrets & lies , then , that it goes beyond gestures of sympathy for the common people into a probing of just what it means to seek 'authenticity' and honesty in everyday lives . 

following her adopted mother's funeral , hortense , a young black optometrist , sets out to find her birth mother , and is disturbed to find out that she is white . 

it is cynthia , a factory worker who lives in a shabby house with her perpetually moody daughter roxanne . 

cynthia's younger brother maurice is a successful photographer who has not seen his sister for ages , largely because of his wife's animosity towards her . 

hortense calls up cynthia , who initially breaks down in tears and refuses to see her . 

but their mutually suspicious meeting gives way to a warm friendship eventually . 

cynthia invites hortense to come along to a party , which maurice is hosting . . . 

secrets & lies has a simple enough theme at its heart -- as one character puts it , "" best to tell the truth , isn't it ? 

that way nobody gets hurt . "" . 

but if the film delivers much more than a trite message , it's because we are also shown how hard it can be to face up to ugly truths , even while the evasions and unspoken grievances slowly choke us . 

hence , cynthia's difficulty with acknowledging ( first to herself , then to others ) that hortense is her daughter . 

one of her first reactions to seeing hortense is a sincere denial that she has ever "" been with a black man "" , before a long-suppressed memory seizes her . 

at the party , cynthia's pretense that hortense is her factory co-worker leads her to ever more convoluted lies , as agonizing as they are funny . 

little lies seep into every corner , like maurice pretending that he's "" just dropping by "" when he visits cynthia after much deliberation . 

maurice's job as a photographer gives the film opportunities for side comments on the main theme - a sad-looking bride that maurice coaxes to smile , a couple who pose awkwardly with a prominent wedding ring and argue about his spectacles . 

one of the most startling images is of a beautiful woman with large scars on her face : she says she needs the photo to look "" as bad as possible "" to collect insurance money , yet the short scene leaves you wondering about what untold story lies behind the scars . 

there are occasionally hilarious moments , as when cynthia attempts to give her daughter some unwelcome advice on contraception , "" i've got a dutch cap floating about somewhere upstairs "" ; or when cynthia stares at her own rather pedestrian legs and tells roxanne , "" if you've got it , flaunt it , is what i say . "" 

as played by brenda blethyn , cynthia comes close to being a caricature , with her nervous , somewhat disconnected way of talking . 

but she's really just right for the role of someone who inspires sympathy and yet strains the tolerance of those around her , precisely because she's so needy of love , perhaps . 

indeed , the whole cast gives warmly rounded , detailed performances . 

the script was developed partly through improvisations , and the fusion of cast , script and director shows best in the party scene - seemingly everyone is talking at the same time , and yet many subtle observations are being made throughout . 

in a very different way , but also using a long single shot , the scene of hortense and cynthia's first meeting in a lonely caf=8a achieves a touching intensity , all the more for their reticence and unspoken feelings . 

the film's climax - with all the secrets and lies finally spilled out in ibsen-esque revelations , and everybody hugging each other - is the one thing that seems false about this film . 

however , it's a film that truly earns its happy ending after the misery and repression of the character's lives . 

when cynthia says near the end , this is the life , innit ? , you get the sense that , following the cynicism of his last film naked , leigh has rediscovered that life can be sweet after all , without comforting illusions . 

the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video . 

 * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! 

 * * * pretty good , bring a friend . 

 * * * * amazing , potent stuff . 

 * * * * * perfection . 

see it twice .

"if you want some hearty laughs , then rat race is the movie for you . 

this unpretentious little comedy , which sneaks into theaters today with very little hype , will have you bouncing in your theater seat . 

and while the film fits neatly into the low-brow , slapstick school of comedy , one refreshing aspect is its lack of mean-spiritedness . 

the plot follows a group of people chosen at random by an eccentric las vegas casino owner ( john cleese ) who must race from vegas to a bus station locker 700 miles away in silver city , n . m . 

inside the locker is a duffel bag containing $2 million . 

the first one to open the locker , gets the bag and the money . 

what the group of participants doesn't know is that cleese's donald sinclair ( "" i can do anything i want - i'm eccentric ! "" ) is staging the race as a betting game for a group of high rollers at the hotel . 

the participants include vera ( whoopi goldberg ) and merrill ( lanai chapman ) , a newly reunited mother and daughter ; disgraced pro football referee owen templeton ( cuba gooding jr . ) ; italian tourist mr . pollini ( rowan atkinson ) ; randy pear ( jon lovitz ) and his family ; the bumbling con men duane and blaine cody ( seth green and vince vieluf ) ; and cynical young lawyer nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) . 

various amusing encounters and mishaps befall the participants en route to silver city . 

screenwriter andy breckman adds a nice touch by not having the racers try to sabotage one another . 

the most side-splitting situations involve vera and merrill's encounter with the squirrel lady , a nice nutsy cameo by kathy bates ; owen's commandeering a charter bus full of lucille ball look-alikes on their way to a lucy convention ; the cody brothers misadventures with a hot-air balloon , a flying cow and a monster truck ; and the pear family's stopover at a barbie museum , which turns out not to be what they think it is . 

the pear family situation is a fine example of the way breckman's script builds the laughs . 

without going into detail , this bit segues from the museum to hitler's touring car , to eva braun's dark lipstick , to lovitz burning his tongue , culminating at a ceremony honoring world war ii veterans . 

rat race's cast is first rate . 

cleese is wonderfully devilish and madcap ; lovitz is , at first , a bit whiny , but his character grows on you ; gooding is having a fine romp ; and dave thomas almost steals the show as cleese's deadpan assistant , a man "" born without a personality . "" 

the film is directed by jerry zucker , who knows something about comedy . 

along with his brother , david , and friend jim abrahams , he was responsible for such hits as airplane ! 

and ruthless people . 

a throwaway subplot , which is good for some laughs , features cleese and his buddies , betting on a series of outlandish situations , including one dealing with a hooker and pepto-bismol . 

this is a fun little feature . 

the only letdown comes at the finale , which is too touchy-feely and sweet , almost negating what came before it . 

rat race is a summer sleeper , but it will keep you awake , as will the laughter of those watching around you .

"the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola's 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages . 

martin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime . 

unfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola's influence on mafia portrayals in the movies . 

seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime . 

this film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s . 

goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film ) . 

the book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york . 

at the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands . 

after couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci ) , he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro ) . 

three of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history . 

wealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) , who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business . 

but the perfect world of "" wiseguys "" gradually begins to fall apart - tommy's unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy's reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry's own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends . 

goodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory . 

scorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker . 

world depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating . 

scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny . 

after being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) , the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens . 

scorsese also manages to break viewer's moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience . 

with the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character's dialogue or narrator's commentary , goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era . 

even if we don't pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker . 

first , we might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively minor subplot is used as movie's ironic prologue . 

then , instead of single narrator , scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards . 

this multiple points of views , both in terms of narration and various subjective shots , only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation . 

same ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack . 

nostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs , while depression , paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s . 

but the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost pastoral , easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed . 

however , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people . 

such scenes , although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings , became very popular among other directors in 1990s . 

fragmentary character of the screenplay , which doesn't have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes , gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese . 

he uses this structure of film to experiment , and most successful of such experiments is hilarious "" a day in life "" segment near the end of the film . 

another essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents . 

the most respectable among them is robert de niro , but his character , who happen to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio , gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues . 

joe pesci deserved his "" oscar "" for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy , and his lines , including ad-libs , probably represent the most memorable element of the film . 

ray liotta , although equally talented , perhaps doesn't look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film . 

liotta's henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs . 

liotta , on the other hand , improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction . 

lorraine bracco is , on the other hand , very effective and believable as karen hill , wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband . 

paul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso , and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small-time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave . 

as a combination of clever sociological study , black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do - work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time . 

because of this achievement , and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers , this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s .

"the happy bastard's quick movie review 

damn that y2k bug . 

it's got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother ( william this time ) in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on . 

little do they know the power within . . . 

going for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there , virus still feels very empty , like a movie going for all flash and no substance . 

we don't know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere , we don't know the origin of what took over the ship ( just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir ) , and , of course , we don't know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout . 

here , it's just "" hey , let's chase these people around with some robots "" . 

the acting is below average , even from the likes of curtis . 

you're more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20 . 

sutherland is wasted and baldwin , well , he's acting like a baldwin , of course . 

the real star here are stan winston's robot design , some schnazzy cgi , and the occasional good gore shot , like picking into someone's brain . 

so , if robots and body parts really turn you on , here's your movie . 

otherwise , it's pretty much a sunken ship of a movie .

"capsule : lesbianism examined in the same hushed and reverential tones reserved for a terminal illness . 

potentially interesting idea made stagy and boring . 

claire of the moon is such an impossibly serious and sober movie that i was waiting for someone to sneeze , just to break the ice . 

it's a perfect example of what my wife calls an s . f . e . 

movie , where s . f . e . 

means so f * * * ing earnest . 

movies like this need wit and brashness to be absorbing . 

claire is one strained speech after another , written delivered with all of the energy and spontenaity of a dmv clerk . 

claire takes two women , claire and noel , both writers , and throws them together in the same cabin at a women-only writer's retreat . 

claire wrights light comedy , while noel is a scholarly authority on porn and sexual behavior . 

obviously , the two of them are going to have plenty to talk about , and for the entire one hundred and twelve insufferable minutes of this movie , that's all they do : talk . 

the movie sets up its ( microscopic ) plot with beat-a-dead-horse-into-glue obviousness . 

the evening talks at the camp are chaired by a motherly type named maggie , a self-professed lesbian , and when noel owns up to also being a lesbian , claire looks like she's been hit with a sockful of wet sand . 

the movie then quickly degenerates into lots of scenes where noel glances at claire with significance , and claire looks out over the water reflectively . 

 ( ugh ! ) 

the most amazing thing about the movie is how people so intelligent can talk so much and yet get so little through their thick heads . 

all of this , of course , leads up to a scene of complete inevitability : claire and noel , in a scene that should have come an hour earlier , because then the movie ends without even the benefit of reflection about what's just happened . 

we never get a hint about how any of this has changed anyone , only how they felt about things that didn't even happen yet . 

the problem with claire . . . 

is not lesbianism as such , but the leaden way it's handled . 

why is it that any "" serious "" ( a better word would be adult or at least thoughtful ) examination of sex in a movie almost always winds up producing a movie that's unwatchably boring ? 

the way this movie deals with lesbianism , we might as well be watching an overheated docudrama about aids . 

many other movies have used the same subject in ways that are a thousand times better -- more engaging , more creative , more intellectually and artistically interesting . 

look at john sayles' lianna , or the interesting and little-seen desert bloom ; both of them have more life and vibrancy than claire . 

what this movie needed was a good swift kick in the pants .

"house on haunted hill ( 1999 ) starring taye diggs , geoffrey rush , ali larter , famke janssen , peter gallagher , bridgette wilson , max perlich , lisa loeb , james marsters , and chris kattan . 

directed by william malone , written by dick beebe , 

 "" house on haunted hill "" initializes itself to the audience with a scene involving zombie-like mental patients attacking and murdering doctors in the goriest ways possible . 

one doctor is killed instantly after having a pencil rammed completely through his neck . 

a nurse has her head forced into a barrel of water . 

these mobs of zombies presented are like those in previous b-horror flicks , with grunting noises and cadaverous movements . 

except this time , at the end of the millenium , the film is given the power to show exactly how horrific these creatures can be . 

in past horror films , the actual murder scenes are left out or not shown forcing the viewer to assume their own nasty bloody deaths for the hapless victims . 

 "" house on haunted hill "" doesn't want their audience to have an imagination , everything is provided for them to watch and squirm , not think . 

this nonsense violence thrown out of nowhere is unfortunately the most refreshing part about this film . 

 "" house on haunted hill "" , which is based on the 1958 film of the same title , introduces a handful of characters as quickly as it can , following the opening blood fest . 

the film has no intention of providing character development or a laudable plot . 

the aim here is to scare the audience with chilling , unexpected shots of blood , guts , and mayhem . 

however , the film is neither scary nor unpredictable . 

the plot involves five people who are dared to spend the night in a haunted house for one million dollars by an amusement park owner ( geoffrey rush ) . 

each character is a failure in the external world and acknowledges that they would do anything for that money . 

since the characters are immediately generalized as either greedy or caring , the expectations of who will survive or not is killed five minutes after you meet them . 

the problem is that every character is not likable . 

the two who come closest to being civilized are a womanizer ( taye diggs - who should be doing films a lot better than this with all of his talent ) and a businesswoman who accepts being womanized ( ali larter ) . 

the characters presented are so annoying and pathetic , that it is hard to cheer for them or scream them . 

the worst character in this film , or maybe in any film released this year , is chris kattan's watson pritchett . 

he spends the whole film whining about the spooky house in a tone so irritating and inappropriate , that he unintentionally begins to seem more evil than the house itself . 

waiting for pritchett to die , was a strenuously difficult act to sit through . 

the most humorous actor of the bunch is geoffrey rush playing steven price ( an homage to victor price who starred in the original ) . 

playing the rich man who supposedly organized the party , he plays the role perfectly in a twisted way where it is obvious that he is up to something just by the expressions on his face . 

however , rush is pretty much wasted in a confusing subplot involving a hateful marriage with evelyn price , played by famke janssen . 

the main problem is that "" house on haunted hill "" is not scary . 

to top off that huge disappointment , every actor was wasted and the script was completely ludicrous . 

if the annoying characters and hilariously bad dialogue were intentionally underdeveloped ( similar to "" deep blue sea "" ) , the goal for creating a creepy , suspenseful action film was completely missed . 
"
"being the self-proclaimed professional film critic that i am , i am somewhat embarrassed to admit that i had not seen lawrence of arabia ( coming soon to dvd ) until only recently . 

after all , it's considered by just about everyone to be the masterpiece epic of director david lean , who also directed films such as bridge on the river kwai , and doctor zhivago . 

so one day , a friend of mine loaned me a copy of the video and i sat down and watched it . 

i was initially skeptical that something made almost 40 years ago would be able to keep my attention for the butt-numbing 3 1/2 hours of its duration . 

but now i fully understand why this has become the film that other epic films are judged against -- the winner of seven academy awards in 1963 for best picture , director , editing , cinematography , art direction , music , and sound . 

after watching the film again , i am convinced that it is simply one of the finest works of cinematic genius to ever illuminate the big screen . 

based on the autobiographical writing of british officer t . e . 

lawrence during world war i , lawrence of arabia depicts lawrence ( played by then-unknown actor peter o'toole ) as a lieutenant lacking any sort of military discipline whatsoever . 

bored with his assignment of coloring maps for the british army in a dimly lit headquarters building , lawrence jumps at the opportunity to be re-assigned as an observer for an arabian prince fighting against the turkish army . 

lawrence quickly sees just how caring and great these desert dwelling people can be and ends up rallying the various tribes together to fight the turks and help the british turn the tide of world war i . 

shot in panavision's famed super 70mm format , the film beautifully illustrates the definition of the word epic . 

it is absolutely breathtaking . 

using stunning cinematography , costuming , and direction , shot in the most uninhabitable location on the face of the earth , i can only imagine what it must have been like to sit in a theater in 1962 and watch this story unfold before my eyes . 

every shot is choreographed as a portrait -- a living tribute to a great land . 

david lean put his reputation on the line to get this film completed , and the fact that it was even greenlit in the first place says something about the ideology of the motion picture industry at the time , a far cry from its pathetic , uncreative existence today . 

after watching the film , the first thing that came to my mind was , "" i've got to do a remake of this film ! "" 

but then i thought about trying to pitch the idea to a modern-day movie executive : "" okay , it's going to be almost four hours long and shot over three months on location in the sahara desert . 

we are going to need to blow up a full-size train because computer-generated effects probably wont do it justice . 

and we are not going to use any big stars , and won't have any female actors since there's no love story . "" 

yes , my friends , the velvet curtain fell on the golden-era of hollywood a long time ago . 

but at least we still have the proof to show all would-be producers and directors out there just how good a film can be . 
"
"what a contrast ! 

in the space of two days , i saw shakespeare in love and hurlyburly . 

i'm not sure you could get two more different movies . 

while the former was all over the top , telegraphing everything , shoving its philosophy of life down our throats , hurlyburly was the complete opposite , wound so tight and with so much buried in its script , one could spend weeks thinking about it . 

this is one interesting movie . 

it's very much in a similar vein to one of my favourite movies of '98 , in the company of men , although not quite so nasty . 

there's lots of talking and some scary insights into the world of men . 

hurlyburly doens't contain much plot : we just follow eddie ( sean penn ) around as he tries to make sense of his life and the people around him . 

his big question is : does it all pertain to him ? 

and if it does , how is he supposed to feel about it all ? 

 "" it "" means everything : television , friends , events that happen . 

i guess it could be summed up more crudely as : what's it all about ? 

this is not a movie for answers . 

donna ( anna paquin ) gives some but they're not really satisfying : they just lead to more questions . 

that's what makes this movie stay on your mind . 

these are the sorts of questions that occupy our time . 

even when we push them to the background , however we resolve these questions influences everything we do . 

the performances are all superb in hurlyburly . 

i haven't seen sean penn in much before ( in fact , i can't remember seeing him in anything ) , but he is brilliant in this . 

eddie isn't a likeable character , but sean penn makes him understandable . 

i don't want to be his friend but i'd like to help him . 

chazz palminteri is also great as phil , making him an awful person . 

i'd never want to know phil but still i understand why eddie wants to be his friend . 

everyone in this film nails their performances , making this world real . 

it's a nasty world ; it's a sexist world . 

unlike shakespeare in love which is unfailingly politically correct , hurlyburly is a man's world , seen unapologetically through the eyes of men . 

i find this fascinating and on two counts , depressing . 

first , it's depressing that such a world exists . 

a large part of hurlyburly's success is that it convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of environment exists every day in hollywood ; that there are a large number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world , toys , playthings . 

sure , everyone is background to everyone else but in this world , women are a long way in the background . 

second , these are the movies that are being made : stories about men's world . 

where are the stories about women's world ? 

not the soap operas and the "" chick flicks "" that are meant to satisfy women , but the real stories that touch on the essence of life like hurlyburly does for men . 

hurlyburly is based on a stage play and that is evident from the moment the film starts . 

it's very talkative , intelligent and static . 

while this can make the film drag a bit , and people sometimes sound like they're quoting textbooks , mostly this is a good thing . 

not all films have to be filled with special effects and sweeping panoramas . 

not all films have to underestimate the intelligence of their audience . 

all it means is that hurlyburly is probably just as effective on video as it is on the large screen . 

it also means that you have to pay attention . 
"
"play it to the bone , the newest addition to ron shelton's sports - themed repertoire fails in numerous ways . 

like most of shelton's other great films ( bull durham , white men can't jump ) , this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots . 

shelton's films are not considered sports films , but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story . 

shelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions . 

play it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull , but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse . 

the film has no social message like its predecessors . 

the relationship between the friends , two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollars , is very confusing for a number of reasons . 

the whole film , since it is primarily a "" buddy picture , "" depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other . 

unfortunately , it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below . 

1 ) we never see how cesar ( antonio banderas ) and vince ( woody harrelson ) meet . 

the two are so different from each other , that a scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory . 

2 ) vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to las vegas . 

there is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something . 

3 ) the third character on the trip , grace ( lolita davidovich ) stands in the way . 

she is in nearly every scene with them , making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male characters are going to have when they fight each other . 

4 ) there are two many interfering , irrelevant side stories . 

vince is convinced that he sees jesus on a regular basis , cesar yells at the sky in spanish when he is angry , and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner . 

these boring tales only hurt the central plot . 

5 ) when it comes to time for the two men to fight , they don't even hesitate to pound each other . 

wasn't the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friends who could never hurt each other ? 

by the time the road trip part of the movie is over with , the film wants to be over . 

shelton , on the other hand , continues to tell his story . 

forty five painful minutes remain . 

the boxing scene between cesar and vince starts out very powerful and interestingly different from other boxing movies . 

however , the fight goes on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable after awhile , kind of like the whole film . 
"
"humanities quest for knowledge never ends . 

so a team of scientists and film-makers travel to the amazon to search for a legendary indian tribe . 

the party consists of anthropologist steven cale ( eric stoltz ) and the camera team consisting of terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) , danny rich ( ice cube ) , gary dixon ( owen wilson ) , denise kahlberg ( kari wuhrer ) and warren westridge ( jonathan hyde ) . 

early on their journey they meet paul sarone ( jon voight ) whose boat is stuck on the shore . 

they agree to give him a ride to the next village . 

he claims to know the area well and can be useful locating the native tribe . 

very soon their friendliness backfires on the group because sarone turns out to be a snake hunter without scruples who only wants to catch a giant anaconda and sell it to a zoo . 

we don't have to wait too long for the giant snake . 

she just had a panther hors d'oevre and now is looking for the main course . 

our heroes paddle around in the amazonas as if it were the pool in their own backyard . 

no wonder giant animals mistake their splashing for a dinner bell . 

our anaconda is a polite one and swallows the first victim in one big gulp . 

enjoy ! 

so much for the first attempt to catch her . 

but who would want to catch a giant snake with a fishing pole ? 

our villain sarone shows his soft side when he stops terri from shooting the snake . 

too bad that anaconda is just about to strangle another member of the expedition . 

one by one she goes after the others . 

eric stoltz is stung by a giant wasp right in the beginning and is mercifully unconcious for the rest of the adventure . 

the rest of the crew keeps entertaining the viewer although not the way the makers of the movie had planned . 

however the scenes without the anaconda are rather boring . 

whenever the leading lady shows up we're in for a laugh . 

the snake reminds us of a favorite character of a famous animated movie even if she should be an awe-inspiring monster . 

her attacks always follow the same plan : one last hypnotic look - she's looking at you , kid - then she speedily wraps herself around her victim and starts to gush it down . 

mostly we don't see the act of devouring . 

but she looks nice when she wiggles away with her bulging middle part . 

whoever did the special effects on this movie may have wanted to go to a zoo first and study some real snakes . 

maybe then the anaconda model would have looked more real . 

the animatronics are somewhat more believable . 

but that didn't work for the strangling scenes . 

don't go see the movie for the f/x . 

they are everything but up-to-date . 

the viewer who likes to watch the end credits will see to his/her surprise that a snake expert was a consultant for the team . 

we may doubt though that he has ever seen the final result of his work . 

a well known american science magazine is also mentioned in the credits , but i will refrain from naming it here to avoid further damage to its reputation . 

the majority of viewer will have left the theater as soon as the credits start rolling , anyway . 

what kind of audience is the target group for this movie ? 

hard to say . 

this can't be a serious horror movie , or can it ? 

see for yourself . 
"
"chill factor is a carbon copy of speed with one notable exception : instead of a speeding bus , we now have an ice cream truck . 

the truck is driven by arlo ( cuba gooding jr . ) and mason ( skeet ulrich ) , who have been instructed by a dying scientist to transport a deadly chemical weapon to a military base by the name of fort mcgruder . 

this particular weapon ( nicknamed `elvis' ) must be kept below a temperature of 50 degrees , or else the shockwave will goo-iffy everything in a mile radius . 

that would be pretty nasty . 

the power of elvis is revealed in the opening scene , as dr . richard long ( david paymer ) conducts a test on an isolated tropical island . 

long accidentally melts 18 soldiers and defoliates virtually the entire island , due to an enormously miscalculated safety distance . 

the commanding officer , general brynner ( peter firth ) , is sentenced to 10 years in prison for the murder of his troops . 

upon his release , the general is intent on tracking the good doctor down , snatching elvis , and selling the weapon to the highest international bidder . 

protecting the fate of the world is a drifting hamburger flipper ( ulrich ) and a feisty ice cream delivery man ( gooding jr . ) , who must elude brynner's men and get elvis to safety at fort mcgruder . 

all the while , of course , they must keep the weapon below 50 degrees . 

this proves to be tricky . 

among the wild adventures arlo and mason partake in is a trip down a tree-covered mountainside in a boat , and a fist fight on top of a moving vehicle . 

they also crack a few dozen witty retorts that we are supposed to find amusing . 

to put it simply , i'll use a clever pun : chill factor should be put on ice . 

director hugh johnson has mixed elements from speed , broken arrow and the lethal weapon series to create a lifelessly bland cocktail of a chase movie . 

when there is some occasional action , the audience seems oddly detached from it . 

perhaps that's because we've already waded through a pool of clich ? s and boring dialogue ; all material that's been used before , and with a lot more spice . 

take the villains , for example . 

they are typical stereotypes of every terrorist that has ever walked the silver screen . 

they speak lines that have been recycled profusely from one movie to the next , divulge important plot details while holding their enemies at gunpoint , and act in very predictable ways . 

the tag-team of gooding jr . and ulrich sounds much more exciting than it is . 

frankly , i'm not sure i can accept cuba as an ice cream man . 

i suppose it's better than him dressed like a giant hot dog , selling jumbo frankfurters on a street corner . 

gooding displays one single emotion in this movie , which is frequently on display in lines like `i'm gonna get on yo ass like last year's underwear ! ' and the incessant sputtering of `oh , sh * t ! ' 

this is virtually the same character he played in jerry maguire and as good as it gets . 

but where gooding was once an exciting actor , he now seems dull and endlessly monotonous . 

at least he's a bit more captivating than ulrich , who has all the film's worst dialogue , but does nothing noticeable to enliven his character . 

the supporting cast , which includes every personality you expect to pop up , is also wasted . 

to be fair , there are a few brief moments of serviceable action . 

and i did chuckle a few times . 

one example is when ulrich ( an employee at `darlene's diner' ) is at the counter when brynner walks through the door . 

`you own this place ? ' 

the general asks . 

`yeah , ' ulrich says . 

`they call me darlene . ' 

these little tidbits of humor are ( mainly ) welcome in this weak , disappointing wreckage of an action film . 

as a speed clone , it could have benefited from a lot more suspense and perhaps ( god forbid ) even some decent writing . 

sadly , i walked away from chill factor only wondering how much fun it could have been . 
"
"everyone knows that old rule , 'never work with children and animals . ' 

in this latest horror flick mimic case , it's 'never work with children and genetically enhanced killer animals' instead , as mimic features both of these and succeeds in doing nothing except mildly engaging the audience . 

the film begins in new york , where we see children dying from a mysterious disease , which is being carried by cockroaches . 

dr . susan tyler ( sorvino ) creates a genetically enhanced bug ( the 'judas' breed ) , however , which is designed to kill all cockroaches . 

the bug does it's job , the cockroaches all die , and the terror is gone . 

'three years later' appears on the screen , and we discover that the judas breed is back , bigger than ever , and ready to kill . 

the spin on this bug , however , is that it can mimic it's predator , and in this case . . . . it's 

humans . 

that should teach us for squishing all those bugs . 

what should be a roller coaster ride with bugs everywhere , tons of gory deaths and some massive set pieces instead turns out to be a rather subdued , almost boring movie which plods along at a very slow pace . 

perhaps the movie was trying to be thought provoking , and trying to avoid the 'predator' type movie it could easily have become . 

if it is , then the director and writers have made the wrong move , because this is perfectly suited to be an all out action fest . 

the director , who bought us cronos , a far superior film , directs the film in a calm , and frankly dull movie . 

there are few exciting sequences , instead just a lot of people talking . 

if the dialogue was intelligent , then it would be all right , but it's sadly babbling nonsense . 

in fact , the script is embarrsingly weak , and the characterizations not much better . sorvino and company are as 2d as characters come , with the script not bothering to develop them . 

there is some action in this film , but it's directed in such an annoying way , it's just infuriating to watch . 

the camera cuts all over the place , disoreitating the audience , and instead of involving the audience in the action , it merely alienates them . 

the peformances are o . k , if slightly below average . 

sorvino is o . k , although she's not very good at conveying terror , or anything emotion really . 

the supporting cast are all sterotypes , with characters such as a big black security guard with a foul mouth , a geeky scientist with spectacles , and what could be the most stereotypical mexican 'old timer' ever . 

their reasonable good fun , however . 

mimic , then , may fail with it's story , pacing and characters , but the film does look good . 

like dark city , mimic is a definite case of style of content . 

it may be a bit too gloomy for it's own good , but the sets look nice , and parts of the film are directed well . 

but looks aren't good enough to save mimic from the depths of mediocre , somewhere where it shouldn't really belong . 

a good opportunity , then , wasted . 

a shame . 

overall rating= review by david wilcock ? 1998 
"
"cinematically speaking , gordon parks' original 1971 _shaft_ is not a great film . 

a bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action , this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman's "" black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks "" to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking . 

yet nearly 30 years after its original release--and long after the genre it spawned , "" blaxploitation , "" died with that decade--the 1971 _shaft_ remains an extremely entertaining watch , never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness . 

the reason for this is the same one that explains the film's connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african-american audience : the title character of john shaft . 

while the fact that the strong , smart , virile , and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance , his broad-based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race : he is comfortable , confident , and proud about who he is , and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass . 

this fact also explains why john singleton's y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is . 

much like the film that started the franchise , this _shaft_'s plot doesn't score points in the originality department , but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers . 

contrary to what has been reported over the past few months , this _shaft_ is not a remake of the original film , but more of a sequel/spinoff . 

the star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels ( 1972's _shaft's_big_score ! _ and 1973's _shaft_in_africa_ ) , richard roundtree , once again plays john shaft , who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city . 

however , the focus of the film lies on his same-named nephew ( samuel l . jackson ) , who , as the film begins , is a cop whose take-no-crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors . 

when a privileged young man named walter wade jr . ( christian bale ) accused of a brutal , racially-motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail , a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p . i . 

but that's easier said than done , for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez ( jeffrey wright ) , a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri ( toni collette ) , the only eyewitness to his crime . 

peoples--or , rather , wright is also the big obstacle in jackson's way toward commanding this film . 

peoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time , and wright is insanely funny during these stages . 

however , he isn't so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish , and peoples' eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable ( which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo , who bowed out before filming ) . 

it's no easy task to steal a film from the jackson ( who is his usual captivating , charismatic self here ) , but that's exactly what wright does--and makes it seem effortless . 

then again , with such a talented ensemble surrounding him , it is not too surprising that jackson's impressive star turn doesn't quite tower over the rest ; he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co-stars . 

bale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in _american_psycho_ , so it only follows that his performance as a similar , less exaggerated character would be spot-on . 

collette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened , conflicted diane . 

busta rhymes brings some good laughs as shaft's sidekick rasaan . 

registering not as strongly--but through no fault of their own--are vanessa williams ( as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez ) and a dismayingly underused roundtree ; they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price , singleton , and shane salerno . 

 ( jackson also has little to "" do "" in a sense ; some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside , his shaft doesn't even have one sex scene . ) 

that singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since he's not really an action director . 

this is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases . 

they move well ( as does the film as a whole ) and are reasonably exciting ; it's just that there's nothing terribly inventive about them . 

these set pieces are functional in the way the script is : they work well enough , but they're unsurprising and conventional . 

but if there's anything that a _shaft_ movie does well , it's make the familiar look cool--and this _shaft_ keeps that tradition alive . 

from the slick title sequence--scored , of course , to isaac hayes' ever-infectious oscar-winning theme song , which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the film--on , the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado . 

even a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced , it feels necessary . 

style doesn't exactly make for a great film , but when it comes to _shaft_ , that's of little consequence . 

what matters above all else is having a good time , and the latest _shaft_ should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad mutha--shut your mouth .

" "" alcohol and drugs = bad . 

not alcohol and drugs = good . 

got it ? "" 

just when you though you've seen enough of brave young women dealing with their personal problems on screen , be that insanity or alcoholism , hollywood releases yet another one of those 'deep , emotional stories about finding yourself' . . 

'28 days' is practically a visualization of the usual 'meaningful' true stories that people are so proudly retelling at aa-meetings . 

gwennie ( sandra bullock ) is a young woman who drowned her problems in alcohol . 

for her life was a big party , with no beginning and no end . 

this behavior has of course estranged her from her only sister and from life itself . 

her existence is filled with endless parties and comic episodes . 

such as when she got drunk with boyfriend jasper ( dominic west ) , borrowed her sister's ( elizabeth perkins ) wedding limo and crashed it into someone's house . 

this time she had to pay with a 28 day stay in court-ordered rehab . 

here she must realize that the only thing that can save her is her is redemption , willpower and commitment . 

most important she must realize her place and direction in life and understand that her life is not just a big party . 

the film itself feels like a rehab program , whining and moaning about things that have been said and written a million times . 

it is a classic cautionary tale . 

an echo . 

a big , fat and expensive clich ? . 

a shadow of last year's 'girl , interrupted' , which likewise followed in the footsteps of great masterpieces like 'the cuckoo's nest' and 'trainspotting' . 

director betty thomas has stuffed her film with so many failures and errors , that it is impossible to sum them all up in one review . 

for some paranoid reason she decided to make her film a drama/comedy . 

jokes and funny characters almost deliberately delude you from the really important and complex issues : alienation , despair , terror , confusion , loneliness . 

and what awesome power and strength of character it actually takes to overcome all that and become clean . 

isn't that what the filmmakers wanted to show in the first place ? 

even the transition process itself seems like a walk in the park . betty thomas' idea of hell is a cozy , homey place where happy alcoholics and cheerful drug addicts are not allowed to smoke , drink or watch tv after 11 . 

it is simply too light , simplified and unnecessary sweet to be taken seriously . 

but the worst thing about it is that it actually thinks that it is saying something of significance . 

that it actually tries to educate the audience with its extremely predictable and primitive story . 

 "" all you need to do is just say no "" , says dr . cornell ( steve buscemi ) as if was the revelation of the century . 

and that's how simple it is ! 

in fact i would rather watch 'lost in space' once again , than return to '28 days' . 

as for acting , it's acceptable , but hardly anything else . 

for sandra bullock it's an opportunity to demonstrate that she is capable of more than 'speed' . 

she handles her part with a surprising professionalism and ease that certainly saves the film from being a complete flop . 

dominic west shines as the source of gwenie's devilish temptations , but elizabeth perkins' and steve buscemi's great talents are wasted on unnoticeable and shallow characters . 

although intellectually 'girl , interrupted' was a greater achievement , '28 days' is superior in its visual aspect . 

there are some nice flash back sequences and occasionally impressive pacing , but the overall technical aspect of this film is on the ground floor . 

the most important thing is that we've seen it before and it was a lot better . 

'clean and sober' , 'only when i laugh' , 'when a man loves a woman' , 'leaving las vegas' and many other stronger films were made about the same issues . 

so what's the point ? 

in other words '28 days' doesn't contribute to the moviemaking business on any level . 

if you're caught in a snowstorm or bolts of lightning fall from the sky and you're standing in front of the movie theatre , you might as well go in and watch '28 days' . 

under all other circumstances stay away , because this film equals $8 and 103 minutes lost .

"ripe with explosions , mass death and really weird hairdos , tsui hark's "" double team "" must be the result of a tipsy hollywood power lunch that decided jean-claude van damme needs another notch on his bad movie-bedpost and nba superstar dennis rodman should have an acting career . 

actually , in "" double team , "" neither's performance is all that bad . 

i've always been the one critic to defend van damme -- he possesses a high charisma level that some genre stars ( namely steven seagal ) never aim for ; it's just that he's never made a movie so exuberantly witty since 1994's "" timecop . "" 

and rodman . . . 

well , he's pretty much rodman . 

he's extremely colorful , and therefore he pretty much fits his role to a t , even if the role is that of an ex-cia weapons expert . 

it's the story that needs some major work . 

van damme plays counter-terrorist operative jack quinn , who teams up with arms dealer yaz ( rodman ) to rub out deadly gangster stavros ( mickey rourke , all beefy and weird-looking ) in an antwerp amusement park . the job is botched when stavros' son gets killed in the gunfire , and quinn is taken off to an island known as "" the colony "" -- a think tank for soldiers "" too valuable to kill "" but "" too dangerous to set free . "" 

quinn escapes and tries to make it back home to his pregnant wife ( natacha lindinger ) , but stavros is out for revenge and kidnaps her . 

so , what's a kickboxing mercenary to do ? 

quinn looks up yaz and the two travel to rome so they can rescue the woman , kill stavros , save the world and do whatever else the screenplay requires them to do . 

with crazy , often eye-popping camera work by peter pau and rodman's lite brite locks , "" double team "" should be a mildly enjoyable guilty pleasure . 

but too much tries to happen in each frame , and the result is a movie that leaves you exhausted rather than exhilarated . 

the numerous action scenes are loud and headache-inducing and the frenetic pacing never slows down enough for us to care about what's going on in the movie . 

and much of what's going on is just wacky . 

there's a whole segment devoted to net-surfing monks that i have yet to figure out . 

and the climax finds quinn going head-to-head with a tiger in the roman coliseum while yaz circles them on a motorcycle , trying to avoid running over land mines and hold on to quinn's baby boy ( who's in a bomb equipped basket ) -- all this while stavros watches shirtless from the bleachers . 

did i mention "" double team "" is strange ? 

when it all comes down , this is just another rarely entertaining formula killathon , albeit one that feels no need to indulge in gratuitous profanity . 

rodman juices things up with his blatantly vibrant screen persona , though , leading up to a stunt where he kicks an opponent between the legs . 

but we didn't need "" double team "" to tell us he could do that , did we ?

"say , tell me if you've seen this before : a crisis on-board a commercial airliner causes a stewardess to have to fly and land the plane herself . 

airport '97 anyone ? 

ray liotta is a psychotic serial killer being transported from new york to california on christmas eve . 

amazingly , on what would seemingly be a busy day of travel on one of the most flown routes , only about six other passengers are on the flight . 

anyway , they take off , liotta escapes and kills all the police and the pilots , and stewardess lauren holly locks herself in the cockpit to fly the plane . 

the story is beyond routine , the script is embarrassing ( at one point , this jumbo jet is flying completely upside down ) , the characters are worthless , and the performances are annoying . 

surprisingly , co-writer steven e . de souza actually wrote the first two "" die hard "" movies ! 

 "" turbulence "" takes place at christmas time , yet the film was released a few days after the holidays . 

brilliant marketing , as no one cares about anything having to do with christmas after december 26th . 

the studio knew they had a bomb , and purposely dumped it out when the fewest number of people would see it .

"august and september are a wasteland when it comes to children's films , and october is a dumping ground for munchkin movies the studios don't want to see slaughtered against family-oriented thanksgiving films . 

last year , the benevolent studio gods gave us digimon , and this year , they bestow max keeble's big move on delighted moviegoers across the country . 

parents will be thrilled because they'll finally have something to drag little austin and kayla to see that doesn't smell nearly as much like ass as digimon did . 

don't get me wrong - keeble , which is actually only a "" ment "" away from being a fetish film , isn't that entertaining . 

in fact , you'd be better off waiting to blow your disposable income when the real kiddie pics ( monsters , inc . , harry potter ) come out next month . 

but if dubya dubya iii tells you to go out and spend money to stimulate the economy , then you'd better do it ( because gassing up the minivan twice a week just isn't going to cut it ) . 

we first see young max keeble ( alex d . linz , home alone 3 ) as a pint-sized superhero , delivering newspapers with the pinpoint accuracy of a david beckham cross , foiling the diabolical plans of the evil ice cream man ( jamie kennedy , jay and silent bob strike back ) and landing the neighborhood honey ( brooke anne smith ) , who , by the way , is the hottest chick in a disney film since emmanuelle chriqui played claire boner in snow day . 

the scenario is , of course , a dream . 

max is really a doofus and he wakes up on his first day of junior high school with a pessimistic attitude , no luck with the ladies and only two friends , both of whom can kindly be described as social outcasts ( and who were both in snow day ) - the perpetually robed robe ( josh peck ) and a clarinet-playing cutie named megan ( summer catch's zena grey ) , who harbors secret feelings for max . 

things don't get any better for max when he arrives at school . 

he has to contend with , among other things , a red-hot science teacher ( amber valletta , family man ) , a pair of polar-opposite bullies ( noel fisher and orlando brown ) , and an illiterate principal ( larry miller , the princess diaries ) who's secretly diverting the school's last dime into the football program . 

when max's father ( grownup nerd robert carradine ) unexpectedly announces the family is moving to a new town at the end of the week , max decides this is the perfect time to exact revenge on everyone who pisses him off . 

whoa - don't worry , parents . 

he doesn't do it klebold-harris style . 

it's all pretty tame stuff , but max ends up in hot water when dad nixes the move , leaving his son dangling in the wind like so many tampon strings . 

director tim hill ( muppets from space ) adds a few nice touches , like max's voiceover character introductions for the film's main characters and a flashback scene that's pretty funny , but there isn't too much else happening here stylewise . . . unless 

you count some farting , a little puking , and a couple of bizarre cameos from tony hawk and lil' romeo .

"if anything , "" stigmata "" should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly-themed films relatively close to one another . 

of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year , it is clearly the worst . 

i suppose i should have seen this coming . 

after all , "" blair witch "" thoroughly creeped me out , "" sixth sense "" was mildly spooky , and then "" stir of echoes "" had its moments , but wasn't anything i'd lose sleep over . 

clearly , the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping . 

is it then any surprise that "" stigmata "" is the dullest , most horribly executed piece of mtv-influenced tripe i have seen in a long while ? 

no , not really . 

patricia arquette plays frankie page , a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globe-trotting mother . 

as it turns out , the rosary belonged to a recently-deceased brazilian priest . 

the priest's church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan ( gabriel byrne ) because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue . 

father kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs , but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue . 

his investigation is soon called off , however , when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata , in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ . 

father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie' s story , considering she's an atheist , but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself , he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on . 

he eventually begins to suspect that his boss , cardinal houseman ( jonathan pryce ) , is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church . 

as it turns out , the dead priest had been working on the translation of a "" fifth gospel "" before they were excommunicated . 

the new rupert wainwright music video . 

 . 

 . 

i mean film "" stigmata "" is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse . 

indeed , it would have been good if it were a music video , because it's only interesting for about five minutes . 

i'm not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow-motion , double-exposure , and extreme close-ups ( whoaaaaaa ! ! ! ! ) , other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and , yes , he has been to film school . 

his camera trickery is interesting for a little while , but eventually , it becomes headache-inducing . 

what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue ( such as it is ) , with wainwright screaming at the audience , "" see ? 

look at what i can do ! 

i'm an ex-cellent dir-ect-or . "" 

maybe then he'd explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow-motion shots of water dripping in reverse , or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ( ooh , scary ! ) . 

if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery , i didn't see it . 

just when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story , here comes a double-exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever . 

arrrrrrrghhhh . 

 . 

 . 

then again , the superfluous camera trickery wouldn't bother me if "" stigmata "" had a story or characters that were remotely engaging . 

though wainwright's vanity certainly doesn't help , he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script . 

where are plot continuity and character development when you need them ? 

case in point : frankie page is the character that ( i assume ) we are supposed to identify and sympathize with , but we aren't given any back story on her character , or any reason to like her . 

the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard-working hairdresser ( who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building ) and she's kind of cute , so let's start the bleeding ! 

the fact that she's clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn't help , either . 

according to frankie page , what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back ? 

go clubbing ! 

sure , that makes sense . 

arquette , byrne , and pryce give it the old college try , but their characters are so one-dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking . 

scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat , because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable . 

even though frankie page's life is falling apart before her very eyes , she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon . 

even more curiously , he seems to be interested in her advances . 

father andrew's religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic . 

as for pryce , he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle , "" i'll get you , my pretty , "" for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded . 

trust me , i'm not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain . 

what's worse , after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats , we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction , veers off in another , then another , and ends up being totally incomprehensible . 

first of all , the film doesn't even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details . how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary ? 

how come an atheist like her was chosen , since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata ? 

actually , i'm not sure what frankie was posessed by . 

supposedly , stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit , but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest , and later by some evil spirit ( i think ) . 

which one is it ? 

the answer to this question , of course , is very simple : the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr . wainwright wants to use this time . 

furthermore , the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap-up , and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church . 

if you do any research at all about the gospel of st . thomas , you'll find that it is not being suppressed by the church ( as the film seems to claim ) , but that it is readily available at your local library . 

there's nothing the catholics need to worry about , though . 

 "" stigmata's "" religion is so off-base that it can't be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church . 

if they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters , they should have gone all-out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns , which would have been far more interesting . 

i'm not catholic ; in fact , i don 't care much for the catholic church , but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means . 

it's rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as "" stigmata "" does . 

it' s not thought-provoking , though it would like to be , and it is definitely not scary , though it pretends to be . 

i'm not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film , because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story . 

maybe it's an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever . 

the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over , and over , and over . 

like so many films of the mtv generation , this one suffers from overkill . 

so much is overdone in "" stigmata , "" that it eventually has no effect on the audience , leaving us to pick out the film's ( many ) flaws . 

i'm also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st . thomas is so earth-shattering . 

when we finally hear it , the saying sounds like something every five-year-old learns on their first day of sunday school , which means that for all its flash , the whole film is really much ado about nothing . 

the dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog , and "" stigmata "" is it . 
"
"as with his other stateside releases , jackie chan's latest chopsocky vehicle , mr . nice guy , is contrived , blockheaded , and lacking in narrative logic . 

but also like those other films , it is a highly enjoyable ride . 

once again , chan's screenwriters ( here edward tang and fibe ma ) have taken the easy way out and named their star's character simply jackie , with no last name . 

this jackie is a world-class chef who co-hosts a popular cooking show on australian television . 

of course , jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist , and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter's ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) expose of a drug dealing ring . 

other plot details , involving a videotape and a biker gang , are irrelevant ; in fact , as is the case with most chan films , the plot itself is just about irrelevant . 

the sole purpose of mr . nice guy's existence are chan's comic fight scenes , and those here do not disappoint . 

director samo hung ( who has a cameo role ) , a longtime collaborator of chan's , does not waste any time putting chan in action , diving head-on into a wild chase/fight/shootout after a brief cooking show prologue . 

other impressive set pieces follow , most notably a chase in a mall , which directly leads to some frenzied , if cliched ( can you say fruit cart ? ) , business involving a runaway carriage ; and an extended late-film sequence at a construction site , in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards , cement mixers , and a deadly buzzsaw . 

none of the action sequences in mr . nice guy are as spectacular as supercop's thrilling helicopter-train finale or rumble in the bronx's daring leap between two buildings ; nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor , respectively . 

but the action delivers , even if the energy peters out before the film's end ( the finale , as spectacular as it is , is a letdown for fans of chan's athletic prowess ) . 

filmed almost entirely in english ( even so , the voices of some english-speaking actors are laughably dubbed ) , mr . nice guy hints at jackie chan's latest transition to hollywood productions ( he made ill-fated attempts with 1980's the big brawl and 1985's the protector ) ; next in the pipeline is rush hour , a stateside production co-starring chris tucker . 

hopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown , and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong productions such as mr . nice guy , for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands , much like they have been before .

"synopsis : easily-angered , chainsmoking architect david encounters his homicidal first wife diedre five years after their divorce . 

diedre easily cons david's not-so-bright new wife molly into believing she's a child psychologist so that she can influence molly and david's quick-tempered son , michael . 

diedre , at the same time , murders a bunch of people . 

comments : the ex is a very bad movie . 

i haven't seen a turkey of this magnitude in quite a while . 

i kept vacillating , however , between giving the ex one star for its sheer awfulness and three stars for its campy humor ( ultimately , i decided to split the difference and give it two stars ) . 

as summarized briefly in the synopsis , this is yet another spurned-psycho-lover-gets-her-revenge type movie . 

i'm not sure how many films have been produced since fatal attraction which use this tired storyline , but it seems like 10 , 000 , 000 , 000 . 

the ex , however , though following many of the standard cliches of this thriller subgenre , differs slightly from the norm in that , at least , it doesn't take itself too seriously like so many other duds do ( malicious and stalked are two examples which come to mind ) . 

those involved in the movie realize they're in a turkey , apparently , and turn in hammy performances which compliment the ludicrous dialogue contained within the script . 

the ex's storyline , as i said , incorporates many cliches predominant in films of its nature ; however , the plot is so overwrought and unbelievable that , after a while , the viewer must accept that logic does not operate in the realm of the movie . 

diedre , david's first wife , kills and kills and kills , for example , without ever having to worry about police investigations and the like ( it's not as though she's bright enough not to leave fingerprints at the scene of the crime ) . 

david and his new wife molly have an incredibly difficult time understanding why michael , their son , has emotional problems , specifically his inability to control his anger . 

though david smokes like tomorrow will never come and blows up at people every other minute in the movie , the connection between him and his son is not made . 

molly is easily swayed by diedre into believing she's a child psychologist and allows the demented woman to spend time with her son . 

time and time again , things do not add up in this movie . 

if a viewer can't accept this fact , then he will definately not like the ex . 

if , on the other hand , he can appreciate the movie for its campiness , then he'll probably like it much better . 

i don't mean to necessarily suggest , however , that the ex is a memorable exercise in camp . 

even when viewed from an it's-so-bad-it's-good angle , this movie isn't all that successful . 

the ex does have its moments , though , almost all of which involve yancy butler ( the psychotic diedre ) and nick mancuso ( david ) . 

these two actors turn in decidedly hammy performances which , oftentimes , elicit chuckles from the audience . 

the truly awful lines written for them help this humor along . 

butler gets the larger portion of bad dialogue ; every time her character kills someone , she has a punchline that's unbelievably inane . 

when she murders a tenant of an apartment she wishes to use to spy on david , for example , diedre whacks the elderly lady with a crowbar and states "" i'm so sorry , your lease is terminated . "" 

or how about when diedre takes out her therapist in another ridiculous scene ? 

 ( diedre's therapist wishes to have her recommitted , so she decides to visit diedre , alone , in her new apartment -- never realizing , of course , that it's not her's . 

therapists typically are catatonically brain-dead in these movies ) . 

having successfully snuffed the woman out , diedre looks at the body and says : "" what was it that you always said to me at the end of each session , dr . jones ? 

oh , that's right . 

'i'm sorry , but your time is up ! ' "" 

this is what passes for humor in the film . 

the audience doesn't necessarily laugh but groan ( the type of groan that suggests the audience can't believe they're watching this crap -- although watching it they are ) . 

nick mancuso's chainsmoking , nervous-wreck character does not have the cheesy lines that butler's character delivers , but his ridiculously overdone performance provides for some better comic relief . 

in between drags off his cigarette , for instance , in one of the movie's best scenes , david tries to explain to his lawyer what a creep his ex-wife is . 

in exaggerated exasperation , he nearly shouts "" the woman is a cuckoo-bird ! "" 

 ( trust me , it is funny in context . ) 

and so , the movie continues until its painfully obvious conclusion . 

i won't reveal the ending specifically ( though anyone remotely familiar with thrillers of this type could probably guess the ending just from this film review ) , but i will say that the ex has one of the biggest fire hazards appearing recently in film . 

molly and david own a cabin that becomes engulfed by flames in approximately three seconds ! 

molly , at one point in the film , not-so-brilliantly observes , after discovering diedre has moved into an apartment across from her family's to spy upon them , that "" she's crazy . "" 

you'd be pretty crazy too if you'd rented this turkey . 

i'd avoid it unless it's on tv and you come across it . 

if you do , you may want to watch it , groan at the bad punchlines and stupid plot , and feel good that you didn't spend money renting it .

"in `enemy at the gates' , jude law is a gifted russian sniper made hero by a political officer named danilov ( joseph fiennes ) who uses him in a propaganda newspaper to raise the hopes of the soldiers and people of stalingrad . 

it's world war ii , and the russian-german standoff in town could determine the outcome of things for the motherland . 

law's vassili is the russian's top pawn to victory . 

lots of war stuff happens . 

an older , german version of jude's character played by ed harris shows up halfway into the proceedings . 

he's equally talented , and the two men play a cat and mouse game trying to kill each other . 

they constantly switch roles , as the war fades far into the background . 

the cast also includes the terrific rachel weisz as a love interest for both vassili and danilov 

the set-up is decent , and so are the production values . 

boasting a wide range of grimy locales , greasy hair , and tattered costumes , the art direction prospers . 

the actors , however , suffer the problem matt damon had in `saving private ryan' . 

either their eyes , teeth , skin , or a combination of other features looked too white and clean . 

with dirt and blood all around , the blinding teeth or bright eyes of these actors divert attention from the action . 

that said , the players are mostly good in their roles , although i don't think ed harris was really trying . 

maybe he realized his role struck a difficult chord in one-notedom . 

while the film is technically about snipers , there are far too many predictable sniping scenes . 

director jean-jacques annaud expects us to view each tense situation with jude and some cohort in a tight spot as edgy and exciting , but after about the sixth time , in which we realize that jude is not going to die , it's relatively pointless . 

we get that he's talented , okay , let's move on . 

that's the problem with `enemy at the gates' ; it just doesn't know when to stop . 

witness the wasted seventeen minutes that could have been spent elsewhere . 

reestablishing his title as the most beautiful ( and often talented ) man on film , jude law carries the movie . 

without him , this costly production would have gone into the ground . 

the story and acting are of good quality , but there's never a sense of authenticity or reality . 

something about this war movie is undeniably modern , and it loses its feeling . 

strange enough , the screenplay is based on the true story of a real russian sniper . 
"
"it seemed wholly appropriate that at a weekend screening of "" the horse whisperer , "" the start of the film was delayed some twenty minutes due to "" projection difficulties . "" 

robert redford's film version of nicholas evans' best-selling novel was supposed to have been in theaters last december , going head-to-head with "" titanic , "" but is only now making its much anticipated debut . 

this ( strategic ? ) 

delay has allowed "" the horse whisperer "" to compete , sans fanfare , against some smaller , unassuming movies during a relatively slower time at the box office . 

no matter . 

redford's film stands head and shoulders above james cameron's ocean-going tragedy , especially in the writing and acting departments . 

whatever the reasons for its postponement , "" the horse whisperer "" supports the old adage "" better late than never . "" 

redford has taken evans' book and given it the big screen treatment . 

while parts of "" the horse whisperer "" are epic in scope and vision , especially the aerial "" travelogue "" that maps out this great country of ours , its real strength lies in the subtleties it uses to paint the fragile alliance between man and beast . 

when her daughter , grace , is involved in a terrible riding accident , hard-driven fashion editor annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) devotes herself to rehabilitating both grace and grace's beloved horse , pilgrim . 

refusing to have the hideously disfigured animal put down , annie researches every possible source of information about equine cures before discovering an article about a faith-healing cowboy of sorts called tom booker ( redford ) , who has a way with horses and , perhaps , with people too . 

undeterred by tom's initial reluctance to get involved , annie drives grace and a sedated pilgrim across country to meet him , and finally persuades tom to work with the uncontrollable animal . 

redford's film unfolds slowly and lovingly , echoing the patience required in healing both physical and psychological wounds . 

the film's a little long and , even if you haven't read the book , it's pretty obvious where it's heading--but these are minor complaints . 

redford and thomas are strong and convincing as the couple drawn by a mutual affection for the great outdoors and each other , but it's scarlett johansson as grace who shines in a more difficult role . 

dianne wiest , chris cooper ( "" lone star "" ) , and sam neill--better than i've seen him before--round out the respectable supporting cast . 

and the director's respect for horses is clearly in evidence . 

one word of warning , however : while brilliantly shot , the accident scene , involving an out-of-control truck , is extremely disturbing . 

redford's canvas is huge and exquisite . 

he doesn't hesitate to incorporate vast , sprawling vistas of the american northwest : spectacular , snow-capped mountain ranges , azure skies , and shimmering fields of wheat--all are resplendent in cinematographer robert richardson's viewfinder . 

veteran english composer john barry was originally signed to score the film but left the project which is a pity , since "" the horse whisperer "" is "" dances with wolves "" by way of "" out of africa "" ( oscar winners both for barry ) . 

fortunately , barry's replacement , thomas newman , contributes a fine score that nicely balances the majesty of montana with the delicate , human conditions--sonorous , string-laden passages that swell with pride playing counterpoint to more poetic , introspective movements ripe with nuance . 

 "" the horse whisperer "" is that rare kind of movie : it looks good , it feels good , and by golly it does you good . 

the wait , it turns out , was well worth it .

"you know the plot : a dimwit with a shady past is seduced into committing a crime only to be double-crossed by a fatal femme . 

in "" palmetto , "" the dimwit is harry barber ( woody harrelson ) , a reporter who's just been released from prison ( he was framed by the gangsters and corrupt officials he was investigating ) . 

enter la femme : rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue ) , the sexy young wife of the richest man in palmetto , florida ( rolf hoppe ) . 

she and her stepdaughter odette ( chlo ? sevigny ) have a plot to extort 500k from the old man : harry will "" kidnap "" odette . 

after groping both women , harry agrees . 

as everyone except harry can see , he's being set up as a fall guy . 

sure enough , before long , harry has a dead body in his trunk and the cops on his tail . 

his brother-in-law ( tom wright ) , an assistant da , has hired harry to be the press liaison for the case , so harry gets a front row seat for his own manhunt ( and we get to watch him sweat-literally ) . 

there are several plot twists , of course-a couple of them even took me by surprise . 

apparently every woman in palmetto is a raving horndog , and they're on harry like he's the only bone in the kennel . 

shue vamps so broadly that i expected tex avery's wolf to show up . 

her incredible performance in "" leaving las vegas "" seems to have been a fluke . 

here , she could easily be mistaken for melanie griffith . 

shue's character is supposed to be a savvy schemer but she comes off as a brainless bimbo . 

in addition to shue and sevigny , the kennel includes gina gershon ( who filled the dimwit-with-a-shady-past role in "" bound "" ) as harry's girlfriend nina ; when harry gets out of jail , she licks his face ( now there's a horndog ) . 

the parts are so overplayed that with a little push "" palmetto "" could have been an over-the-top parody of film noir a la "" romeo is bleeding . "" 

as it is , it's best watched at 2am on showtime ( the love scenes seem to have been written for one of that channel's soft porn programs anyway ) . 

 "" palmetto "" has a well-known director , volker schl ? ndorff , who's best known for his adaptations of major literary works , especially "" the tin drum . "" 

i suppose he must have been drawn to this plot-by-numbers script by the same admiration for classic film noir that led scorsese to remake "" cape fear . "" 

schl ? ndorff tries hard-he makes an interesting motif out of the ubiquitous palmetto bugs-but nothing can freshen up this stale script .

"'traffic violation' dr . daniel's review of u-turn 

dr . d's rating : critical condition ( 

okay , here's the deal . 

i'll be the first one to grant that everybody needs a day off now and then . 

i'll even go so far as to say that a vacation is a necessary part of doing any job well . 

i mean , hey , i've been known to stretch a weekend into a three-day outing , if friday looks to be a slow day . 

and if monday ain't looking like a pick-me-up , well , i've been known to give martha nell a call and say , "" do me a favor , sweetheart . 

bump old man ferguson's boil lancing to tuesday morning , and tell miss audrey that i'll swing by her house monday evening and see if we can't get her trick knee back in line . "" 

a simple sentence like that , and i've got a nice four-day fishing trip with the boys , or more often than not , a trip up to cherokee , n . c . , for jackpot bingo and assorted other mountain funnery . 

but the point is , if you take a day off , do something different . 

if you've worked yourself silly for months , relax a bit . 

sleep in . 

eat pancakes at noon . 

microwave an egg in its shell . 

watch pro wrestling with the sound off . 

listen to some barry white records at high speed . 

whatever . 

but do not , under any circumstances , spend your vacation doing the same thing you do for a living . 

and , if you do , don't make the final product look ten times worse than it would any other time . 

because i do not want to hear your sob stories , oliver stone . 

you apparently thought you needed a break from making "" important films . "" 

cool . 

so you found this hinky little book and decided to make it a movie . 

that's cool , too . 

but , ollie , old sage , do not take a good story and a hot cast and make one of the most pointless and worthless films of the decade . 

i'm just eager to meet you one day , so i can buy you a stoli , look you in the eye and say , "" what in the wide world of sports were you thinking with u-turn ? "" 

and i'll stand there staring 'til i get a straight answer . 

sean penn stars u-turn , as bobby , a drifter who's had some troubles a while back . 

he's heading cross the desert minus two fingers when his mustang ragtop blows a radiator hose , stranding him in superior , arizona , held there by an "" ignorant , inbred , turtleneck hick "" of a mechanic named darrell . 

while darrell puts a new hose on the ride , bobby walks into town to see what's cooking . 

is it needless of me to say that superior , arizona , is not exactly the shiny scrubbed home of all things lovely ? 

probably not . 

bobby meets up with grace ( jennifer lopez ) , who invites him back to her place , for drape-hanging and other domestic issues . 

just as those issues are starting up , grace's husband , jake , storms in , looking like check-out day of the elks lodge convention . 

just beats bobby silly . 

bobby takes to the road , only to meet up with jake again , and jake asks bobby to kill grace . 

a little while later , grace asks bobby to kill jake . 

them murderous arizonians . 

gotta love 'em . 

if any of this sounds familiar , congratulations . 

you win a kewpie doll . 

the story is a straight shoplift of red rock west , a cult favorite a few years back from john dahl , maker of the phenomenal the last seduction . 

but the contest doesn't end there , guys and gals . 

we get steals from russ meyer movies , where everybody in town is horny and sweaty . 

we get the town from bad day at black rock , minus the train , plus busty women who can speak . 

look at any schwarzenegger film , and you'll see our hero , bobby , as bobby has a mudhole stomped in his keister a dozen times , has his ribs stove in at least fifteen times , gets bit by a tarantula , gets shot at , and ends up with vultures circling overhead , all the while getting up like he just got a shaving nick . 

bobby as terminator ? 

stretch it a bit , and we have a five-finger discount from doc hollywood , where the whole story occurs because of car trouble , forcing the main character to stay at the mercy of the town and the mechanic . 

okay , he's working from a book , so maybe ollie's not totally to blame for blatantly copping these ideas . 

i just expect a man who can make up an alternative history of the united states to be able to craft a few original ideas before exposing the negative . 

i just wish he hadn't brought a cast like this together for what amounts to a group toe-stub . 

sean penn gives a great performance , and jennifer lopez and nick nolte are as on target as they can be , playing over-the-top caricatures of stereotype characters . 

the best thing about the movie is watching penn react to the madness around him and try to figure out exactly what the blankety-blank is going on . 

too bad it's not fun to watch when it's happening to us . . . while 

we sit through this mess of a film . 

u-turn is not a bad film if you're a fan of technique . 

it's the oliver stone you've always known . 

robert richardson is his usual cinematographer , and rob and ollie know how to shoot a flick -- great camera angles , shifting viewpoints , wicked colors , nice looking pictures . 

but pictures of what ? 

i think i'd rather stare at a xeroxed envelope for two hours than try to figure out the tilt-o-whirl point of this loser film . 

plot twists are one thing , repetition is almost unforgivable , and this is dang near as unforgivable as any movie i've seen in the past five years . 

oliver , i know your body of work is nothing to sniff at . 

you've been nice enough to limit us to only one doors movie , and films like platoon , jfk , wall street and nixon give us plenty to dig on . 

your scripts are certainly respectable , your budgets are up there on the screen , and your actors don't dog it . 

and i know that , maybe , with u-turn , you were just kicking back , just having fun . 

that's fine . 

but don't do that with a movie with the potential of this one . 

do some police academy sequel ( imagine that . ) 

do a big comedy , like a remake of it's a mad , mad , mad , mad world . 

but do not drop a limp u-turn out of your pocket and expect us to accept it as "" an oliver stone movie , "" and not question why it stinks like week-old snook . 

there's a right way to have fun , and a wrong way to have fun . 

this was as wrong as you can get without going to jail .

"the general's daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film we'll see this year -- or perhaps the stupidest clever film . 

it's confusing to a critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction . 

that , however , is what happens when legendary screenwriter william goldman takes a pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller . 

the punched-up punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the general's daughter has a brain in its head , even as the remaining 75% of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense . 

our hero is warrant officer paul brenner , a brash investigator for the u . s . army's criminal investigation division . 

his latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) at a georgia base , the victim found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault and strangulation . 

complicating the case is the fact that capt . campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) , a war hero and potential vice-presidential nominee . 

general campbell wants to keep the case out of the press , which gives brenner only the 36 hours before the fbi steps in . 

teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) -- who , coincidentally enough , once had a romantic relationship with brenner -- brenner begins uncovering dark secrets from the late captain's past that make the case ever more sordid . 

if only the sordidness were the worst of the general's daughter's problems . 

scenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary , their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filtered-light sleaze . 

director simon west likely thinks he's covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers , but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches , which is the film's fatal flaw . 

it's a trend he continues for two hours , taking the story's few virtues and slapping a coat of moron-proof obviousness over them . 

characters who may ( wink wink ) turn out to be villains are photographed in ominous shadow ; cutaway inserts of the captain campbell's still-living face after the corpse is uncovered insure against five-minute attention spans . 

west just can't help himself from overdirecting every minute of the general's daughter . 

he even turns a scene of footage shown on cnn into an excuse for slow-fade edits . 

bubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell . 

the slickest scene finds brenner squaring off with captain campbell's mentor , a psychological warfare expert named moore ( james woods ) . 

there's something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another . 

indeed , travolta gets to sink his teeth into dozens of choice lines based on his delight at provoking authority figures ( to the local sheriff of the georgia county : "" shouldn't you be out night-sticking the colored folk ? "" ) . 

even the lame device of brenner and sunhill's sexual history provides a few winning zingers . 

goldman's dialogue can serve up a bigger laugh than you'll find in most so-called comedies . 

dialogue , unfortunately , just isn't enough to make a quality script . 

it's difficult to take a movie about a criminal investigation seriously when the investigators are both too stupid to solve it sooner ( an idiotic inability to recognize the nature of the crime scene ) and too lucky for it to last any longer ( not one but two occasions where brenner catches a vital piece of evidence out of the corner of his eye ) . 

by the time the general's daughter wanders towards its over-wrought , psycho-in-the-rain finale , west's heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the film occasionally fun . 

it's silly and pretentious film-making , but at least it provides a giggle or five . 

goldman should tear the 15 decent pages out of this script and turn them into a stand-up routine .

"gordon fleming ( peter mullan ) is in a bind . 

he has a new , unexpected baby and his business , hazardous material removal , is in danger of going under . 

when he and his crew get a job opportunity at the long-abandoned danvers state hospital , he underbids the competition to secure the contract and promises to get the three-week job done in one . 

it will prove to be a fateful week for them all in "" session 9 . "" 

gordo gets the job to remove asbestos and other hazardous materials from the spooky old mental hospital in preparation for relocating town offices there . 

their guided tour of the facility by a local official , bill giggs ( paul guilfoyle ) , brings them through some of the creepier parts of the former asylum . 

but , a job is a job and , if they finish in a week , as promised , there is a $10000 bonus in store . 

as they get down to their work , things , normal and not so normal , begin to happen . 

gordon hears a disembodied voice beckoning him . 

phil ( david caruso ) is conflicted working with a guy , hank ( josh lucas ) , who is seeing his old girlfriend . 

mike ( co-screenwriter steven gevedon ) has discovered a cache of audiotapes and transcripts from old psychiatric sessions ( hence , the title ) with inmate mary hobbs , a multi-personality patient with a dark secret . 

gordo's nephew , jeff ( brendan sexton iii ) , suffers from night phobia and is afraid to venture into the dark bowels of the hospital . 

as the agreed upon week draws to an end , hank mysteriously disappears from the workplace after a nocturnal confrontation with someone ( something ? ) in the hospital . 

tensions mount and distrust build among the rest as they watch their chance for the bonus start to slip away . 

but , there is more , much more , at stake as the hospital and its history of insanity weigh on them all . 

i don't want to give away too much of the story of "" session 9 , "" so i'll stop there . 

what we have here is a spooky horror flick that uses none of the jump-out-at-you-from-the-dark cheap shots that have become part and parcel with horror films since the advent of "" halloween "" and "" friday the thirteenth . "" 

there is no cat leaping out of the dark or the shock of suddenly seeing oneself in a strategically placed mirror . 

with the exception of one shadowy and chilling image at one point spooky interlude in the film , there is little that you can get your arms around as far as what , specifically , is "" frightening . "" 

as i watched "" session 9 "" i became aware of the subtle things that built up during the story that make it a true horror movie . 

the striking high-definition video camera work by uta briesewitz ( who worked with the director , brad anderson , on his "" next stop wonderland "" ) helps to build up tension with close-ups , fluid camera movement and odd angles in a way that would make alfred hitchcock proud . 

music , too , is used to intense effect , joining with the camera to make simple scenes frightening , even horrifying . 

couple these tech feats with an intelligent story that uses elements of "" the shining , "" "" the blair witch project "" and , even "" the texas chainsaw massacre "" and you get a decent , intriguing horror flick . 

additionally , the brilliant decision to shoot at danvers state hospital gives the film another starring character , the institution itself , which lends even more chills to the equation . 

acting is another factor that raises "" session 9 "" above the usual dreck presented in recent horror hits like "" scream , "" "" i know what you did last summer "" and their sequels . 

those films took good-looking , though generic , young actors and actresses and put them to use to build up a body count , substituting mayhem for real horror . 

anderson opted , instead , to use mature , experienced actors like peter mullan and david caruso to fill his characters' shoes and the difference in casting quality is notable . 

mullan , in particular , puts an arc on his character , gordon , as the troubled guy who slowly and inexorably falls under the pressures of family , job and , finally , danvers state hospital . 

the rest of the small cast fit the bill as people , not just fodder for the mayhem . 

david caruso , as gordo's senior man and near equal in the business , shows just how good an actor he is . 

he made the jump from tv's "" nypd blue "" to film far too soon and his decisions in the roles he took ( i'll never forget the horrendous "" jade "" ) were less than star making . 

he rolls his sleeves up and does the job well here . 

gevedon , lucas and sexton are more than fodder , too . 

the only problem with "" session 9 "" lay in the uninspired ending . 

it takes on a fairly conventional finale that covers old ground and is a bit of a disappointment after the terrific ( and inspired ) build up . 

the pleasure is getting there and i wish that anderson and gevedon had kept up the steam they had so ably built during the bulk of the film 

 "" session 9 "" is an unusual feat . 

it is scary , doesn't use cheap tricks and raises goose bumps with its intelligently rendered , subtle horror . 

because of the local interest of danvers , it should do well with the northeast crowd . 

i hope it gets the national distribution it deserves . 

i give it a b+ .

"in october of 1962 the united states found itself on the brink of nuclear holocaust when u2 spy plane fly-overs of cuba revealed that the soviet union was actively deploying and installing medium range ballistic missiles 90 miles from the us . 

president john kennedy ( bruce greenwood ) and his staff must face this major threat to world peace and stop soviet expansionism in director roger donaldson's dramatic recreation of the most dangerous crisis in american history in "" thirteen days . "" 

one of the highlights to come out of made-for-tv movies was a 1974 entry called "" missiles of october "" that also recreated the historic event that almost embroiled the us , ussr and the world in an all out nuclear showdown . 

that teleplay , starring william devane and martin sheen as john and bobby , showed the political tensions of the period that brought to the fore the danger the world faced in those two weeks in 1962 . 

now , a quarter of a century after the landmark tv movie , director roger donaldson and producer kevin costner team together again ( the last time was for the taught spy thriller "" no way out "" ) to re-enact the events of that most dangerous time in america's and the world's history . 

taken from the viewpoint of special assistant to the president kenneth p . o'donnell ( costner ) , donaldson and crew recreate that volatile event , once again , as the country is plunged into what could have been total nuclear war . 

as o'donnell gets ready to head to work one october morning , he deals with the usual family crises and problems . 

meanwhile , a u2 spy plane photo mission over cuba has produced some startling images - medium range nuclear missiles in the first stage of deployment . 

suddenly , ken's routine day switches into crisis mode as the president and his key advisor bobby begin to muster the considerable forces of the us military to face the soviet threat . 

where "" thirteen days "" differs most from "" missiles of october "" is , as expected , in the scope of the project . 

there is a big difference , budget-wise , between making a television docudrama and one that goes to the big screen . 

it shows as the makers of "" thirteen days "" craft a recreation of the cuban missile crisis that encompasses not only the political intrigue within the white house , it also depicts the events that took place as america girds itself for nuclear confrontation . 

the cast , a true ensemble , is led , surprisingly , by bruce greenwood as jfk and not by kevin costner . 

costner's o'donnell represents the family guy thing as the drama of the crisis has its impact on him and his family . 

this puts a personal spin on the film as we see both the crisis and america's preparation for war and the pressure it brings to bear on those in the know . 

kenny reassures his wife and kids that all will be okay and they will be safe , but he knows that , if the crisis comes to a head , his family will be no more . 

the meat of "" thirteen days "" is in the big picture , not the microcosm of family , though . 

this is where the film stands out as we see the workings of our government on the highest levels . 

the story does not just cover the face-off between the world's two most powerful countries ; it also depicts the animosity between the president and the military/cia . 

the disaster of the bay of pigs invasion the year before left a distrustful taste in the mouths of the generals and admirals who blame the kennedys for not backing the cuban expatriates fighting fidel castro . 

the missile crisis becomes a struggle for power as the army/navy/air force want to flex their might and invade cuba , while jfk wants to end the confrontation peaceably but with america's dignity and world leadership intact . 

while the internal battle for power rages in the white house , with air force chief curtis lemay ( kevin conway ) advising the president to bomb cuba into the stone age , our armed forces are set into motion to stop the soviets with a blockade of offensive weapons to cuba . 

this is where the political intrigues of high office are replaced by exciting action . 

when the first confrontation takes place between a us warship and a soviet freighter , the tension is palpable . 

the most involving action sequence takes place late in the game as another u2 is sent up to shoot some snaps of the buildup and the fully prepared soviet forces launch an anti-aircraft attack on the hapless pilot of the spy plane . 

this is a sweaty palm sequence to say the least , making you squirm in your seat as you try to help the pilot avoid those missiles . 

the ensemble cast places greenwood as the first among equals with like weight given to all the principle players . 

greenwood does not play act at being a caricature of jfk , foregoing the typical kennedy boston accent . 

instead , he plays the man as a powerful figure who has to maintain the dignity of the office , directing his subordinates but giving them the latitude to make clear all of his options . 

kennedy used this decision by committee method to good effect as his senior staff uncovers all the options available to the president . 

costner , as ken o'donnell , is really a supporting cast member as a kennedy crony brought on board as a personal political favor . 

costner plays o'donnell as if he crammed on old jfk speeches with a forced kennedyesque twang to his speech . 

the rest of the players are first rate from start to finish with steven culp looking and sounding just like robert kennedy . 

the rest of the familiar players in this drama are uniformly well cast , too . 

standing out are michael fairman as the beleaguered us ambassador to the un , adlai stevenson , who was forced to become the challenging voice of the united states in the united nations and i remember the confrontation vividly . 

the filmmakers capture the accusations laid down by stevenson with accuracy , using old style video footage to good effect . 

dylan baker has the look and feel of the intelligentsia as the brainy secretary of defense robert mcnamara . 

kevin conway gives his general lemay the right "" bomb them to hell "" attitude . 

also notable is christopher lawford as navy pilot william ecker who , with his wingman , takes on the dangerous mission of a low-level photo recon into the heart of cuba , bravely challenging kenny o'donnell's admonition , "" don' get shot . "" 

tech credits are superb across the board with an admirable depiction of the us armed forces being placed on a war footing . 

it's an impressive production with the careful use of period aircraft and ships that gives the film a veracity fitting the event . 

solid costuming by isis mussenden is subtle but has the look of the kennedys . 

there is the usual array of vintage cars from the period to make things look right . 

the special f/x of the u2 sequences are a nice crafting of computer imaging . 

the cuban missile crisis is probably the most intense two weeks that the united states has ever faced in its survival as a world leader . 

helmer donaldson and his fine crew and cast have given the depiction of this crucial event with the care and attention to details that make this one of the finest docudramas of the year . 

i give "" thirteen days "" an a- .

"another formula 'feel good' quirky comedy from the british isles , much like "" waking ned devine , "" and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line . 

it is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin . 

the strength of this film lies in its rational theme , that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol . 

the film is tolerable until after its first hour , it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas . 

but its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message . 

its message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the 'war on drugs' is about to be escalated into colombia . 

the drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future , it has so far just ended up causing america's jails to be overcrowded with non-violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america's drug usage and drug supply . 

billions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war , by backing a corrupt government ( remember vietnam ! ) with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country . 

everything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war . 

the film's mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never . 

there has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether . 

the film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle-aged woman , grace ( brenda blethyn ) , who fell out of an airplane , evidently committing suicide . 

the widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined . 

he left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up , without her knowledge , their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage . 

the widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband's enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless . 

she also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london , honey ( quick ) . 

what makes the affair doubly unsatisfying , is that when conferring with honey , she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her . 

even though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can , the creditors swoop down on her like vultures . 

her gardener and handyman , matthew ( ferguson ) , decides to stay on with her , despite his last check bouncing . 

since she is an expert amateur horticulturist , he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants , which he grows for private use . 

the two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity , as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high-quality stuff . 

for grace , this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt ; for the scotsman , matthew , it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky ( valerie ) . 

the locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed : the police sergeant ( campbell ) pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace's greenhouse is for , the friendly vicar ( phillips ) counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can't control , and the doctor ( clunes ) enjoys smoking the weed for recreation . 

the story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big-time drug dealer instead of having matthew go , because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesn't want matthew to end up in jail . 

it is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail . 

the scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london , trying to find a drug dealer , while dressed out of place , in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal , was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole , whereby it never recovered its dignity . 

the film moves into the formula mode , whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive , as she meets an international drug dealer , a frenchman ( tcheky karyo ) , who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences , thereby becoming a celebrity . 

things work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood . 

there are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded . 

this 'unhip' film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly , but should be tolerated as something naughty middle-aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute .

"carry on at your convenience is all about the goings-on in the factory of a toilet manufacturer , wc boggs ( kenneth williams ) . 

once they have won an order to manufacture 1000 bidets in two months and charles coote ( charles hawtrey ) has designed a suitable model , the factory employees set to work but are interrupted by union representative vic spanner ( kenneth cope ) and friend bernie hulke ( bernard bresslaw ) who call them out on strikes on the slightest pretext . 

meanwhile , chief foreman sid plummer ( sid james ) is growing tired of his wife beattie ( hattie jacques ) and her budgie . 

he would much rather live next door with fellow boggs worker chloe moore ( joan sims ) but once he discovers that the budgie can predict the winners of horse races , he is over the moon and flush with money . 

his daughter , myrtle plummer ( jacki piper ) , is going out with wc's son lewis boggs ( richard o'callaghan ) and this causes conflict on the staff day out to the seaside when vic spanner vies for her attentions . 

in the end , if the strike does not cease , boggs will have to close down his factory , but the support of a group of women led by coote's wife-to-be and spanner's mother , agatha spanner ( renee houston ) , try to resolve the situation . 

also , sid realises that his budgie has caused him nothing but trouble since it started predicting horse race winners . 

there are some good performances , as usual , from sid james and kenneth williams in their standard roles . 

charles hawtrey is third billing but only appears in a few scenes . 

his part is mildly amusing . 

richard o'callaghan is appealing as bogg's stuck-up son , patsy rowlands is funny as miss withering , bogg's assistant , and renee houston is terrific in her small part as agatha . 

however , sole acting honours go to hattie jacques as beattie plummer . 

although her character is not directly involved with the main storyline , she manages to input a great deal of pathos and feeling into her character . 

a marvellous performance from a marvellous actress . 

the film suffers from annoying performances by bernard bresslaw and especially kenneth cope . 

in his carry on debut , cope overdoes his role as spanner making him so annoying as to be unfunny . 

joan sims returns as the love interest ( instead of barbara windsor ) . 

sims' 'usual' part as the downtrodden wife was taken by hattie jacques . 

additionally , bill maynard as fred moore is very poor . 

this carry on movie tries it best to entertain the viewer : - the locations and wealth of characters are appealing . 

however , the toilet humour becomes tiresome very quickly and some of the performances leave a lot to be desired . 

this movie does not know where it is going . 

it was made in 1971 and talbot rothwell the scriptwriter seems to be in two minds whether to go for 'bluer' jokes or to maintain the 'innocent' jokes success of most of its predecessors . 

that is why this film suffers . 

a minor carry on film whose major asset is the performance by hattie jacques . 

the new 'minor-regulars' such as o'callaghan and piper are not able to enliven the movie and the toilet humour becomes humourless after a while .

"one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy's wedding . 

and she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it . 

her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald , who hasn't made a worthwhile film since 1986 . 

but the fact is , betsy's wedding is also an alan alda film . 

and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years , alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects , including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life . 

written and directed by alda , betsy's wedding is a vibrant slice-of-life , mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor . 

alda's comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare . 

as bride and groom , molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film , but they are by far the least interesting . 

walsh is a nonentity , with all the screen presence of a door knob . 

ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain . 

she looks hideous with her short-cropped orange hair , red lip-stick and grotesque outfits . 

she's supposed to be a dress designer , but she looks more like a clown . 

and to make matters worse , ringwald's performance matches her appearance . 

thankfully , alda keeps ringwald's screen time to a minimum ; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters . 

the wedding is just a device to bring together the bride's working-class , italian family and the groom's rich , gentile family . 

ringwald's folks are homey and down-to-earth , with alda as her free-spirited father , madeline kahn as her practical mother , and ally sheedy as her lonely sister . 

walsh's clan , on the other hand , is prim , proper and ostentatious . 

when the two families meet and mingle , the movie becomes a story of culture clash , or as one character puts it , "" money versus values . "" 

ally sheedy , in a wonderfully understated performance , is one of the film's most pleasant surprises . 

sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body . 

it's anthony lapaglia , however , who seizes the spotlight . 

lapaglia plays stevie dee , a suave , overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old-fashioned chivalry . 

lapaglia's sincere but dim-witted character is a riot . 

and what's uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro , with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure . 

lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting , and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role-model and partly a rip-off . 

i don't know whether to say a star is born or a star is re-born , but i do know that lapaglia's over-the-top performance should not be missed . 

the scrumptious comic acting , however , extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia . 

joe pesci , in particular , sinks his teeth into his role as alda's unscrupulous brother-in-law , a slum lord with mob ties , who is cheating on his wife ( catherine o'hara ) . 

alda , faced with challenge of both directing and acting , somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride's financially-strapped father , a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet . 

the film adopts alda's psychological point of view as he tries to one : plan the wedding , and two : pay for it . 

as a filmmaker , alda's style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful . 

and while he doesn't have the comic genius of a woody allen , alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy .

"no humans were harmed , tested or tasted in the making of this film . 

all recipes are fictions . 

twentieth century fox does not condone cannibalism . 

a psychological thriller that will scare you to the depth of your soul ! 

director/writer antonia bird shows us that the most terrifying horror is not provided by giant beasts , but instead by monsters lurking in ourselves . . 

 "" . . they were a party of settlers in covered wagon times and they had to resent to cannibalism in order to stay alive . . "" 

this true story , briefly mentioned in "" the shining "" , has no turned into a 143 minutes long motion picture . 

in 1847 , the united states was a land of pioneers , of gold-starved americans making their way west . 

it was a period of manifest destiny , the inevitability of the country extending its boundaries , stretching out its arms and consuming all the land it could . 

capt . john boyd ( guy pearce ) has become both a "" hero "" and a victim during this period of relentless consumption . . . 

in ways he could never have imagined . 

boyd's journey to hell begins when he is awarded for an act of cowardice during a horrific mexican-american war battle earns him banishment to a desolate military outpost , a waystation for western travelers in the barren and icy sierra nevada mountains in california . 

upon his arrival he is greeted by a small , motley group of soldiers , including his commanding officer , hart ( jeffrey jones ) , a previously intelligent and sophisticated man who has lost his aristocratic origin in the heat of battle and has pretty much given up on life ; toffler ( jeremy davies ) , the fort's personal emissary to the lord ; knox ( stephen spinella ) , the veterinarian that plays doctor , who never met a bottle of whiskey he didn't like ; reich ( neal mcdonough ) , the no-nonsense soldier of the group ; and the seriously "" over-medicated "" cleaves ( david arquette ) , a cook whose meals are inspired more by peyote than culinary ambitions . 

into this cold , bleak and bizarre world staggers a stranger , colqhoun ( robert carlyle ) , a half-starved scot who had been traveling with a group of settlers until they became snowbound . 

seeking refuge in a cave , they soon ran out of food - and were forced to consume one another . 

colqhoun barely escaped becoming an hors d'oeuvre himself . 

our heroes then decide to journey through the mountains to find the survivors , and colqhoun tags along to help out . 

soon it becomes clear that colqhoun's tale has ramifications beyond cannibalism and the will to survive . 

it involves an old indian myth called weendigo , which states that a man who eats the flesh of another steals that person's strength , spirit and very essence . 

his hunger becomes an insatiable craving : the more he eats , the more he wants , and the stronger he becomes . 

there can never be enough , and death is the only escape . . 

it's all fairly sickening and you have to have a healthy stomach to see the whole movie through . 

as professionally made as the movie is , you have to wonder who they thought would come piling into the theater to see this . 

teen-age horror fans won't care because none of the soldiers look remotely like neve campell . 

older folks might show up when they hear that the movie is actually a satire about the pioneer spirit , but they'll be disappointed once all the raw meat starts getting waved in their faces . 

but jokes aside , this is a film that is well worth watching . 

it has wonderful and mature characters , that few horror film s can boast of and a strangely effective story that continues to electrify you till the end . 

the two main characters are also the most interesting . 

boyd is a simple , honest man tiered of war , killing and fear . 

his sacred wish is to live a normal , quite life away from gunpowder and blood . 

colqhoun is different . 

he proves that a man , on the brink of death , would do anything to stay alive , including sacrificing his own soul . 

he believes so much in this indian myth that he starts to change physically . 

it is the power of the human mind and conviction that make miracles happen . 

the atmosphere in "" ravenous "" is macabre and bizarre , scary and surreal . 

completely isolated from the rest of the world , stands fort spencer . 

here time stands still , and nothing changes . 

the inhabitants are soldiers driven by war and pillage . 

they are all somehow losers of society that have been banished -- men that are used to killing and have not done anything else in their entire life . 

men that are nothing , and has nothing to loose . 

the result is some sort of cabin fever . 

cannibalism is more like a sick game for them . 

since they find no pleasure in living , they find some excitement in killing and dying . 

it's like "" who's going to die first ? "" 

the unchangeable icy landscape , where birds do not sing and even wind doesn't move the leaves on the trees , resembles kubrick's "" the shining "" . 

it's hard to not get mad here ! 

one of the scary aspects of the film is a strange connection that the viewer establishes with the characters , and starts to understand them , although they have turned into half crazed killers . 

music is another factor that strengthens the atmosphere . 

a strange musical score , composed by michael nyman ( the piano ) and damon albarn , that often seems out of place , and in complete contrast to the image , somehow reflects the characters' twisted reactions on the world and their situation . 

the director herself stated that it was "" ok to laugh "" during the picture . 

and i must admit that it is often very funny , in a strange way ( such as the wonderful quote : "" . . it's 

lonely being a cannibal . 

you don't get that many friends . . . "" 

or when colqhoun is quoting ben franklin , saying "" eat to live . 

don't live to eat . "" ) . but 

mostly it is frightening and shocking as it goes deeper into the minds of these strange men and we witness their psychological change . 

every actor does a great job . 

especially robert carlyle as the sinister and intelligent cannibal , and guy pearce as the moral and honest soldier , nagged by his undeserved honor . 

this strange couple resemble lestat and lois in neil jordan's 'interview with the vampire' . 

actually there are many amusing parallels and connections to vampire movies , since the topics are so alike . 

 "" ravenous "" starts wonderfully and continues to shock and scare until it gets to the finale , where it looses focus and gets too primitive and rather boring . 

however these little failures don't diminish the impression . 

this is a bizarre dark comedy about the human mind and its change in different situations . 

it is a scary fable about the monster that lurks in everyone's soul , a dark side which we're all trying to hide -- but it's there -- always . 

it is one of the most frightening and successful horror films since "" the shining "" . 

 "" . . i said no food . 

i didn't say there was nothing to eat . . . "" 

- colqhoun , ravenous 
"
"staring , george clooney , arnold schwarzenegger , chris o'donnell and uma thurman with alicia silverstone . 

well to start this off i'd just like to say a couple things . 

first is , i miss michael keaton , i miss tim burton and would much prefer to think that these last two batman films are all like a dallas dream sequence . 

not even from the first film was batman really the 'star' though he was damn close in the first couple anyway . 

in 'batman forever' and now in 'batman & robin' he's almost pushed to being a bit player . 

i can't really say if clooney ( who regardless was better than kilmer ) was a very good batman or not . 

he's given next to nothing to do at all , he might as well not have been there and it wouldn't have made much difference . 

now , joel schumacher has said that he refuses to bend to the masses that have hated his films and cheered for the return of buton that he wont make batman brooding and dark . 

fine , i mean granted 'batman returns' while being an awsome film was a bit to dark sometimes . 

yet his bright neon , campy style is just killing anything this series meant to me . 

i'm usually very easy on films . 

i loved 'con air' and other films some critics have slammed . 

granted that film really was paper thin , cliche ridden , except for one thing , it was fun . 

there is virtually no fun in this film at all . 

i couldn't have cared less . 

it'll thrill the little ones as theres no violence really , none everyone comes out fine in the end like those old tv shows where it ends with everyone laughing . 

schwarzenegger is awful , i mean really , really bad . . . 

and this is coming from a regular fan of his work . 

i love his movies most of the time and the basic reason is he never says much in any of them . 

he talks all to often in this movie . 

i would have much prefered to have seen patric stewart in the roll . 

i believe to truely like a film you have to care about at least someone in a film . 

i liked alfred but the reason behind it is a cheap shot . 
"
"if you've ever perused my college comedy diary "" another year in the life of a nerd "" ( i never run out of cheap plugs ) , you know i didn't get along with my first-semester roommate too well . 

in fact , during the three-week period between thanksgiving and christmas break , i said a total of four sentences to him . 

so when i saw in the residence hall cable listings a movie called roommates , i envisioned 90 minutes of conflict between a couple of bickering young adults trapped in a 10 x 13 foot dorm room . 

then i saw that the star of roommates is peter falk . 

scratch that idea . 

but i still say someone should film the story of two college roommates whose relationship is less than ideal . 

of course , in my case it would be a silent picture . 

even without the college element , i still decided to watch roommates because i had absolutely nothing to do , unless you count studying for final exams ( and who does ? ) . 

i'm glad i did . 

peter falk's performance was actually what made the movie . 

and this is a guy i never considered a real actor , more like someone who went around in a trenchcoat solving prescripted mysteries . 

falk pleasantly surprised me here , permanently earning my respect , so all you "" columbo "" fans who think i live to insult the guy can just falk off . 

falk plays rocky , a 107-year-old polish baker who raises his grandson after both the kid's parents die . 

the movie begins with the mom's death and the son moving in with his grandparents . 

after a couple stops along the son's journey to manhood , roommates progresses to the present day , with the grandson a surgeon and rocky in a condemned house he refuses to leave . 

the surgeon reluctantly offers the only possible solution -- rocky will have to move into his place , the basement of a building rented by a group of chinese students ( "" communists ! "" ) . 

the movie spans nine more years of rocky's relationship with his grandson , and the trials posed when the grandson meets and falls in love with--gasp--a woman , and starts spending all his time with her . 

so , in his grandson's absence , rocky turns his pursuits to professional boxing , achieveing the world heavyweight title in a climactic fight with apollo creed . . . 

or am i confusing movie plots again ? 

roommates has an almost epic feel to it , covering several generations of a family with one fiesty immigrant who refuses to die . 

death , though , knocks at the door of almost every other major character in the the movie . 

roommates has about as many casualties as the first halloween . 

the number can't be counted on one hand , unless of course you're the victim of some hideous genetic mutation . 

and you can probably guess who says farewell to planet earth at the end of the movie ( no , not duran duran ) . 

i won't come out and say it . 

instead , i'll just sit here and hum "" eye of the tiger "" until each and every one of you figures it out . 

roommates plays on all the major emotions . 

it knows when to make you laugh and when to make you cry . 

movies that can perfectly mix comedy and drama are always hits with the audience , even though this one bombed at the theaters . 

my point ? 

there are no absolutes . 

or , another possible point , peter falk just isn't such a great box office draw . 

either way , this is still a good movie and you should give it a chance like i did , whether you hate your roommate or not .

" "" the endurance : shackleton's legendary antarctic expedition "" 

in 1914 , as the great war descended upon europe , sir ernest shackleton began his third expedition to antarctica , this time to be the first to cross the ice-bound continent on foot . 

28 men set sail on the brigantine endurance and they would not be heard from again for nearly two years . 

director george butler , using film footage and photographs from the historic journey , tells their remarkable story in "" the endurance : shackleton's legendary antarctic expedition . "" 

the expedition started out as a merely incredibly difficult quest to traverse , on foot , the vast wasteland of antarctica . 

as the intrepid ship and crew entered the weddell sea , the entry to the cold , cruel continent , they did not plan on the dense pack ice bringing the voyage to an abrupt halt as the endurance became trapped within sight of land . 

for months the ice thickened and compressed until the ship was crushed , stranding the men on the flow , propelling them away from their goal and , eventually , into their lifeboats for safety . 

shackleton , faced with a desolate situation , made the decision to lead the three tiny boats to the relative safety of uninhabited elephant island . 

once on this "" safe "" haven , shackleton next turned his sights to saving his crew and returning them to civilization . 

he and five of his men leave the island in an open boat to make the 800 mile journey on the world's roughest sea to get help from the nearest inhabited island of south georgia . 

miraculously , the six land , after 17 days at sea , on the uninhabited side of the target island and are forced to trek across treacherous , snow covered mountains , covering 22 miles in just 36 hours . 

this ordeal is followed by several attempts by shackleton to get back to elephant island to rescue the remaining crewmen . 

in the end , he is successful and everyone made it back home alive , only to be swallowed up by the ravages of the war . 

the title of this fascinating documentary , "" the endurance , "" is more than just the name of ship that carried the crew of brave men to the edge of the world . 

it is also the description of the stamina and ability of every one of the men who survived 19-months of the toughest , most grueling conditions on the face of the earth . 

the name of the film is a tribute to every member of the crew and to the ship that sheltered them for many month of frigid antarctic weather . 

it also describes the focused mental state of shackleton who never gave up on himself or his men . 

with astonishing foresight , shackleton brought australian cinematographer and photographer frank hurley along on the journey . 

the filmed footage and photos are remarkable as they capture the ordeal of the men , day to day life , the affection all felt for their loyal sled dogs , the slow destruction of the endurance and the preparations to get off of the pack ice flow . 

after the sinking of the ship , the remaining film stock , with the exception of a still camera and three rolls of film , had to be discarded so the continuing chronicle of the incredible journey gets less photo documentation as the ordeal plods on . 

considering hurley was using relatively primitive photo technology in one of the world's harshest environments and captured so much on film is a feat unto itself . 

 ( hurley created his own account of the shackleton expedition in his 1919 documentary , "" south , "" an interesting companion piece for "" the endurance . "" 

if shackleton's original idea , document his trek across the frigid southern continent , had been successful , it would have been considered a super human feat . 

as you watch the story of "" the endurance "" unfold , you realize that the disastrous obstacles the sir ernest and his men faced and overcame were even greater accomplishments than the first intent . 

 ( shackleton's amazing 800-mile journey in an open boat is fodder for a rousing adventure story all by itself . ) 

there are a couple of minor nitpicks with this fine work , though . 

actor liam neeson narrates the story , but his voice is too soft spoken and lilting for the dramatic tale . 

the nature of the ordeal also concentrates most of the visual material , both film and photo , in the documentary's first half . 

as the crew's adventure takes more drastic paths , hurley had less and less film stock available to chronicle the awesome events . 

helmer butler and his team fill in the blanks , but the treasure of "" the endurance , "" its film footage , is mostly relegated to the early months of the expedition . 

i can't think of a true-life adventure that shows , better , the triumph of man over seemingly insurmountable odds . 

 "" the endurance , "" based on caroline alexander's book , is an eye-opening documentary that goes where few men have gone before and , even more remarkably , all 28 survivors lived to tell about it . 

i give it a b+ . 
"
"after the press screening of "" moulin rouge , "" i stood in the lobby of the theater listening to the reactions of my friends and colleagues . 

everyone seemed a bit numb , understandable after sitting through a barrage of often-incongruous sounds and images . 

a pal of mine simply said that he loved the film and could hardly wait to take his wife to see it . 

another enthusiast immediately began to analyze the production , while a woman who flat-out hated the movie gave him the skunk eye . 

when one fellow quietly stated "" i've never really been a fan of musicals , "" the statement surprised me because , even though the story is told almost completely through song , i didn't think of it as a musical . 

there is so much going on in "" moulin rouge "" that "" musical "" seems too small a term to cover it . 

 "" moulin rouge "" is the kind of creation that sends critics scurrying off to the big tub o' adjectives in search of proper words to describe the experience . 

australian director baz luhrmann , the man behind "" strictly ballroom "" and "" romeo + juliet , "" fills the heads of viewers with unique camerawork , opulent imagery and songs ranging from "" the sound of music "" to "" smells like teen spirit . "" 

sumptuous and beautiful , vulgar and overdone , "" moulin rogue "" travels through the looking glass while an ethereal stereo loaded with 50 years worth of catchy tunes operates on the "" random "" setting . 

oh , and it has a story as well . 

 "" it was 1899 , the summer of love . . . 

 "" christian ( ewan mcgregor ) is a penniless young writer newly arrived in paris , "" to write about truth , beauty , freedom and love , "" where he encounters a group of bohemians , led by henri de toulouse-lautrec ( john leguizamo ) . 

christian meets satine ( nicole kidman ) , a courtesan from the legendary moulin rogue , and his world transforms from black and white to technicolor . 

at once fragile and vivacious , the dazzling red-haired woman sweeps him off his feet without even trying . 

christian instantly falls in love with her and satine finds herself smitten with him as well , which is quite a hindrance for someone in her profession . 

working with the bohemians and moulin rogue impresario harold zidler ( jim broadbent ) , christian writes an opus modestly named "" spectacular spectacular . "" 

zidler quickly finds a backer , the wealthy duke of monroth ( richard roxburgh ) , but there's a catch ? the duke also wants the hand of the fair satine . 

as if all that isn't enough , satine has a cough , and while a cough in the real world probably indicates a cold , it rarely turns out to be anything that simple in movie land . 

like a teeter-totter , "" moulin rogue "" moves up and down between the ridiculous and the sublime . 

one of the loveliest moments comes as christine and satine commune outdoors at night , becoming part of a defiantly unrealistic parisian cityscape straight from a book of fairy tales . 

together they dance , while serenaded by the man in the moon ( alessandro safina provides the vocals ) , apparently transported from the classic georges m ? li ? s silent film to guard the nocturnal sky . 

other scenes merely traffic in everything-and-the-kitchen-sink overload . 

the cavorting of toulouse-lautrec and his comrades gets strained at times and some of their overt comedy , accompanied by cartoon sound effects , is overly reminiscent of the frenzied farce that sitcoms like "" bewitched "" beat into the ground . 

of course , sensory overload was exactly what baz luhrmann had in mind . 

 "" we never heard from baz to turn it down , "" one of the actors told the los angeles times . 

 "" it was always , 'more ! 

more ! ' "" 

the director even sent a note to his cast reading , "" i dare you to make me say you've gone too far . "" 

the musical numbers reflect his attitude . 

one knockout piece , the "" elephant love medley , "" incorporates the beatles' "" all you need is love , "" u2's "" in the name of love , "" dolly parton's "" i will always love you "" and elton john and bernie taupin's "" your song . "" 

need more ? 

how about "" diamonds are a girl's best friend "" spiced with portions of "" material girl ? "" 

luhrmann's cast offers a wide variety of approaches that , together , add up to something messy , but often wonderful . 

ewan mcgregor is extremely likable as christian , emphasizing the sincerity of the love-struck poet . 

mcgregor's singing voice is robust and adds vigor at just the right moments . 

once labeled the "" ice queen , "" nicole kidman melts that characterization with a sizzling , yet tender , performance . 

she handles the songs adroitly , although her voice sounds a bit thin in the upper range . 

veteran character actor jim broadbent is suitably larger than life as ringmaster zidler ? wait until you see him perform "" like a virgin . "" 

as the buffoonish duke , richard roxburgh proves to be the film's weakest link , although i'm sure he was simply following instructions . 

i suspect "" moulin rogue "" will be one of those love-it-or-hate-it films . 

while i didn't completely love it , i most certainly liked it a lot . 

over the course of a year , i see well over 300 movies , and most of them look like xeroxes of each other . 

 "" moulin rogue "" is an original , and an original , even a flawed one , is a thing to be cherished .

"post-chasing amy , a slew of love-triangle movies : this month we have kissing a fool , co-starring amy's own lee , and april brings us the object of my affection , which may as well be titled chasing allan , for it is the story of a woman who falls in love with her gay roommate . 

 ( to be absolutely six degrees of kevin bacon about it , that film stars schwimmer's friend jennifer aniston . ) 

if only kevin smith could write them all . . . 

schwimmer stars as womanizing chicago sportscaster max , who falls in love with his best friend jay ( lee ) 's book editor samantha ( avital ) a mere twenty-four hours after meeting her . 

they are soon engaged , and max , because of his own raging libido , grows suspicious of samantha's fidelity . 

he convinces jay to flirt with samantha during the development of his book , to "" test her "" . 

the trouble is , jay might be secretly in love with her . 

to stretch this flat , sitcom premise to feature length , the plot is framed by a climactic wedding , at which bonnie hunt recounts the triangular tale--the events leading up to the nuptials--to an annoying fat man and his silly girlfriend . 

hunt has the best comic timing of anyone in the film ; schwimmer can spin bad dialogue into mildly humorous dialogue ; and lee , poor lee , is miscast . 

so hysterically funny in chasing amy , here he is forced to repress his comic instincts : to swear , to yell , to talk about oral sex . . . 

the script's idea of a character trait is to stress that jay is a "" sensitive man "" , and then show him drinking pepto bismol when he's stewing over his girl trouble . 

as for avital , an israeli actress , she is warm and sweet , but we don't know anything about her character other than that it takes her an incredibly long time to realize the most obvious things . 

she also too closely resembles the stunningly beautiful kari wuhrer , who plays schwimmer's assistant and personal temptress , turning that particular subplot into an unintentional riff on vertigo . 

there are a handful , a smattering , of good scenes in kissing a fool . 

i enjoyed a moment in a comedy club , during which jay gets up and asks "" has anyone here ever hated their girlfriend so much you wanted to kill her ? "" 

over and over until he's booted off stage . 

there are also a few obviously improvised lines that are fresher than anything that's on the page . 

kissing a fool is never as clever as the thursday night joke-machine friends that spawned schwimmer's movie career , so save yourself eight dollars and watch three episodes of that series back to back .

"mike myers , you certainly did throw us a ? frickin' bone here in what you call ? the biggest austin powers adventure yet . ' 

austin powers : the spy who shagged me is the sequel to the 1997 smash comedy austin powers : international man of mystery . 

many are skeptical about sequels , saying that the sequel is never better or as good as the original , but austin powers : tswsm goes beyond the first film . 

austin powers : the spy who shagged me stars mike myers in three different roles . 

he reprises his role as the title character , austin powers , the shagadelic spy whose body was frozen in 1967 , and unfrozen in 1997 to stop his long time nemesis dr . evil , also played by mike myers , from destroying the earth . 

tswsm leaves off where the original stopped , with dr . evil's ? frisch's big boy' space capsule floating through space . 

dr . evil returns back to earth by ejecting from his capsule , plotting to go back in his time machine to the year 1967 , in which he plans to steal austin powers' "" mojo "" , what keeps austin going with spy talents . 

upon his return to his secret lair , which is now a starbucks coffee shop , dr . evil learns that his evil henchman , which includes the returning robert wagner as number 2 and mindy sterling as frau , have created a 1/8 size clone of dr . evil , which is later named mini me . 

the evil mini me replaces scott evil , played by seth green , as dr . evil's son in the madman's mind , because dr . evil thinks of scott to be only "" quasi-evil . "" 

dr . evil has always wanted a son that is evil just like him , and now he has one . 

dr . evil tells mini me , "" you complete me , "" in a loving manner . 

dr . evil loving ? 

wow ! 

mike myers' third role is as fat bastard , a scottish henchman of dr . evil's , who is sent to steal the mojo from austin powers' frozen body . 

austin powers learns of dr . evil's trip back into the 60s , and uses his own time machine to take him back to 1967 , to try to save his mojo before fat bastard gets a hold of it . 

once arriving in the year 1967 , austin travels to his "" pad "" , his smashing home/dance club , where he meets felicity shagwell , played by heather graham , a cia agent who is willing to help him in his journey to stop dr . evil . 

as the film progresses , hilarious one liners are thrown at us , mainly by dr . evil , for example , "" don't go there , girlfriend ! "" 

to the president of the united states . 

many witty gags take place , note the entire tent scene , and just plain , funny scenes which are so stupid- they're funny come a dozen per fifteen minutes . 

take for example , scott evil going on the jerry springer show complaining about how evil his father is . 

the way austin powers : tswsm uses its humor is clever , throwing a hilarious scene at you , followed by five minutes of one liners , followed by another outrageous scene , so you never stop laughing . 

there was honestly not one moment in austin powers : tswsm where i wasn't laughing . 

the last film that i laughed so hard in , was well , austin powers ! 

it is apparent that mike myers knew how funny this film was while writing it . 

the film even makes fun of itself in a line , something along the lines of , "" it's funny how england and southern california look nothing alike . "" 

tswsm was filmed in southern california , but was supposed to take place in england . 

i can tell you one thing- he is having a lot of fun with this enormously popular character , which is all over television , newspapers , magazines , and the movie theaters . 

i believe that dr . evil got more attention in the tswsm than austin powers did . 

dr . evil provided more laughs , more memorable moments , and more interesting dialogue than austin did this time around , who seems to missing the funny touch that he had in the first film . 

i felt that austin really did have his mojo taken away , but from screenplay writer mike myers , not fat bastard . 

also making a great addition to the series is mini me , who is played by verne troyer . 

even though the midget actor is 30 years old , he is adorable by dr . evil's side constantly . 

the first austin powers film had barely any sentimental quality , such as lack of character development , barely any detailed plot characteristics , and barely any good acting , but austin powers tswsm actually shows some quality behind the frequent humor . 

mike myers , with his three roles , acts as eddie murphy did in the nutty professor , disguising himself completely in one of the roles . 

 ( fat bastard ) all three characters are different , and mike myers does do a good job handling each one of them . 

heather graham made a great addition with her talent to tswsm , and does a much better job than elizabeth hurley did , who gave a very flat performance in the original , speaking her lines without any feeling or emotion . 

speaking of hurley , she can be seen in tswsm for a few brief moments . 

hopefully , graham tags along for future austin powers adventures . 

the bottom line- a groovy sequel that mike myers put all of his mojo into writing . 
"
"so , it's thirty years later , and oscar and felix are together again . 

that might have been an exciting notion if it wasn't for the fact that the "" odd couple "" of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies : 1993's "" grumpy old men , "" 1995's "" grumpier old men , "" and 1997's "" out to sea "" ( i . e . 

 "" grumpiest old men "" ) . 

so , "" the odd couple ii "" ( i . e . 

 "" the grumpiest old men of all , really "" ) seems just another entry in a tired series . 

the plot is even similar to that of "" grumpy old men "" in that lemmon and matthau's mismatched characters are brought together by a romance between their children . 

oscar's son ( jonathan silverman ) and felix's daughter ( lisa waltz ) are getting married , and former roommates felix ungar ( lemmon ) and oscar madison ( matthau ) meet at the airport and decide to share a car . 

 . 

 . 

then hilarity ensues . 

well , a few chuckles ensue anyway . 

neil simon , the award-winning playwright who created oscar and felix , provides the screenplay , which is a shock , because the script is a piece of talentless hackwork from beginning to end . 

unlike the original play/movie , "" odd couple ii "" doesn't find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters . 

instead , it depends upon a series of humorous situations : oscar and felix lose the car over a cliff , are caught smuggling mexicans over the border , take up with two women on the run from their violent husbands ( the women are played by christine baranski of "" cybill "" and jean smart of "" designing women "" ) , and hitch a ride with a man who dies in the desert . 

the original 1968 movie "" the odd couple "" remains a classic comedy . 

it introduced the motif of roommate-as-spouse that has provided gags for movies and sitcoms ever since . 

it was the second outing for the lemmon/matthau team ( which debuted in 1966's "" the fortune cookie "" ) , and they made a couple more worthwhile comedies , "" the front page "" ( 1974 ) and "" buddy buddy "" ( 1981 ) , before going their separate ways . 

the reunion of lemmon and matthau in "" grumpy old men "" six years ago was delightful , and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the first movie . 

but "" out to sea "" and "" the odd couple ii "" are just beating a grumpy old horse . 

 ( you can add lemmon's "" my fellow americans , "" i . e . 

 "" grumpy old presidents , "" to that list , too . ) 

let's hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do . 

let's hope also that we see neil simon's name on movies that do it justice ( this is his first since 1993's "" lost in yonkers "" ) .

"i remember seeing the trailer of the black cauldron on the pinocchio video . 

it really scared me , and i didn't want to go see it . 

however , after i heard about how wonderful it was , i wanted to see it . 

i didn't get a chance to do so , until now . 

the film , disney's 25th animated feature , opens with a menacing shot of a great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell the tale : a long time ago in the land of prydain , there was a king so evil , that his spirit was captured in the cauldron . 

it has been hidden for centuries , and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors , and with them rule the world ? and destroy it . 

then , we meet a farmer-wizard , dallben , and his young apprentice , taran . 

taran dreams of being a warrior instead of being a `pig-keeper' ( they have a pig named hen-wen ) . 

one day , as he gives hen wen a nice warm bath , the pig goes crazy , and dallben then realizes , after watching hen wen's thoughts through a bucket of water , that taran must hide hen wen in the forest . 

an evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron , and only hen wen has the power to show its location . 

taran leads hen wen into the forest , but of course , he loses her , and tries to go find her . 

along the way , he meets up with a mischievous little creature named gurgi , who desires `munchings and crunchings' , much to his dismay ( besides , he stole an apple that taran was trying to use to bring back hen wen ) . 

when he hears hen wen's squeal from far away , though , he races to her rescue ? only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants . 

taran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king's castle from far away . 

taran climbs the castle walls , and brings himself into the castle , where he attempts to rescue hen wen . 

he manages to do so , but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon . 

there , he meets princess eilonwy ( and her magic bauble , another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron ) , and the two escape through the deep castle walls . 

along the way , taran finds a sword in a burial chamber , and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm , who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie . 

the three manage to escape the horned king's castle , but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic . 

as they rest in the forest , gurgi reappears , claiming to have found hen wen's trail . 

he leads taran , eilonwy and fflewdurr , by way of `pig tracks' , to a whirlpool . 

suddenly , they all get sucked under , and they meet the fairy-like fairfolk . 

taran is reunited with hen wen , and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the land of morva . 

he then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron , it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world . 

with the help of a grumpy fairy named doli , the four travelers manage to find themselves at a mysterious cottage . 

it turns out to be no ordinary cottage ; three comically strange witches inhabit the place . 

when taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron , they agree to let him have it ? in exchange for his sword . 

taran agrees , much to eilonwy's horror , but at least they get the black cauldron . 

but ? the cauldron can't be destroyed , only its evil powers can be stopped . 

the only way to do so is for a living being to climb into it of his own free will ? never to return alive . 

things take a turn for the worse when the horned king's henchmen capture taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr , along with the black cauldron , and lead them back to the castle . 

taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors ( this is the most horrifying scene in the film , because here , a dead army comes alive ? ) . 

just when all seems lost , though , gurgi reappears , and rescues taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr . 

taran is about to jump into the black cauldron , but gurgi stops him , not wanting him to throw his life away . 

gurgi then jumps into the black cauldron , and the deathless warriors decay . 

taran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi , but he is forced to do battle against the horned king . 

he kicks the horned king away , who is then magically sucked into the black cauldron , where its powers immediately destroy him completely . 

taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr manage to escape from the horned king's castle just as it self-destructs . 

the witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away , but fflewdurr stops them , saying that they `never give anything away , they bargain' . 

in response to this , the witches offer taran his sword back , but taran instead has a new trade : the cauldron for gurgi . 

the trade is made ; gurgi's seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group . 

as taran cradles him in his arms , though , gurgi stirs-he is not dead after all ! 

the happy group then returns home , where hen wen ( brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past ) , dallben , and even doli , await their triumphant return . 

as spectacular as it sounds , the black cauldron really suffered a lot in its past times . 

before ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions , he had bought a novel by lloyd alexander called the black cauldron , a sword and sorcery tale for the studio . 

bringing this book to the screen was the studio's fondest dream . 

miller , who entitled himself as the executive producer , promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects . 

when micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio , the animators were struggling to complete the black cauldron . 

by this time , things had gone really rocky for the animation department . 

many of the studio's old men had retired or died . 

therefore , the animators suffered a hard time making this film . 

originally budgeted at $25 million , the costs raised to $40 million because of constant changes on everything ? and when it was finally released on june 24 , 1985 , the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics , but somehow the film flopped . 

the film was rated pg and the film , although `disneyfied' from lloyd alexander's chronicles of prydain ( which is what this film is based on ) , was much more scarier and darker than disney's other previous efforts , such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound , which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it . 

in addition , other critics rejected it for having `no heart' and `unmemorable' , compared to other disney animated features . 

but whatever the real reason , the black cauldron was a financial disaster , grossing only $21 million . 

the failure of the film grounded the studio's animation department , and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale , and it seemed like animated features would no longer become a part of the studio's reputation . 

the next two disney animated features , the great mouse detective and oliver and company , although a little more lighthearted than the black cauldron , didn't do much better ( although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective ) . 

only with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features . 

as for the black cauldron , it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron . 

finally , the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released . 

because of all this , you might ask yourself , was the black cauldron really such a bad movie ? 

the people who had seen the film didn't think so . 

in fact , many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film , but of course , they denied it . 

for a while , it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video ? until september 1997 , disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom . 

few people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc ( including me ) and for those who hadn't seen the film yet ( i am included here ) , they got quite a treat . 

but people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors , about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating ( in the uk , the u rating means universal : suitable for all ages , kinda like their own version of g ) . 

somewhere online , a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petition that said , `bring back the black cauldron ! ' , and because of that , disney finally decided to release the video to the united states . 

before that time , rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed , like the uk video , so that it would get a g rating , and that they would add in songs . 

those rumors were put to rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron * would * be released in its pg rated version . 

even still , when it was finally released to the us , some reaction was mixed . 

some felt that it was indeed cut , but some felt that it wasn't . 

but these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable , since a film that was absent for thirteen years was finally available . 

as for myself , when i saw the movie for the first time ( on converted ntsc video ) , i didn't expect much at all . 

in fact , i had heard so many mediocre things about it , that i didn't think the film would ever be such a good film . 

much to my surprise , when i saw the first few minutes of the film , i was asking myself , "" this is the same film everyone saw ? 

the one that flopped at the box office ? 

the one that critics and filmgoers alike called "" a bad movie "" ? 

this doesn't seem like all of the above . 

instead , it's a classic in its own right . 

the film has a wonderful cast of characters . 

there's taran ( grant bardsley ) , an assistant pig keeper who would rather be a warrior than a pig-keeper , the story's hero . 

the critics have said that taran is not likeable at all , but the opposite is true . 

he is brave , loyal , and eventually learns a lesson about friendship later on . 

there's a likeable character here ! 

not that he's the only likeable character in the film . 

there's gurgi ( john biner ) , a lovable little , uh , thing who remains loyal to taran , even though they don't quite hit it off at first . 

but another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman , a dwarf named creeper ( phil fondacairo ) , who is loyal to the film's imaginative and sinister villain , the horned king ( voiced gruesomely by john hurt ) , yet he also fears his neck . 

the other characters , including the sidekicks , a spunky , but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm , and three comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret , although pleasant and likeable , aren't quite as well rounded as they should be . 

the story itself is an adventurous one , a quest involving the mystical pig , hen wen , the black cauldron itself , and an army of deathless ones with everything : a hooking opening to a spectacular finale . 

elmer bernstein's music also tells the story perfectly , in a dark , yet calming manner . 

the animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the darkest time of the studios . 

even though there are some occasional effects that are not quite good , like the ground opening when the black cauldron rises out of the earth , the animation overall is top notch . 

overall ? this film is an entertaining endeavor . 

fans unfamiliar to the lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain will get a kick out of this one , except young kids . 

there are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than disney's other films ( although some consider the stampede sequence from the lion king and frollo observing esmeralda in the fires of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just as scary ) , which is the main reason why this film is rated pg . 

fans familiar to the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel and the movie . 

even though it doesn't have all of the ingredients of a true disney film , this film is a classic in its own right , and deserves a far better chance than what it has been given . 

that better chance has finally come . 

whatever reason about why the black cauldron was such a big failure seems to have disappeared , and the film has finally achieved its place among disney's most proudest achievements . 

i can't help but think though , whatever would have happened if the black cauldron * was * a box office success ?

"dreamworks pictures presents a jinks/ cohen company production kevin spacey annette bening "" american beauty "" thora birch allison janney peter gallagher mena suvari wes bentley and chris cooper co-producers stan wlodkowski alan ball music by thomas newman costume designer julie weiss film editor tariq anway chris greenbury production designer naomi shohan director of photography conrad l . hall , a . s . c . 

produced by bruce cohen & dan jinks written by alan ball directed by sam mendes 

 "" both my wife and daughter think i'm this gigantic loser . 

and they're right . 

i have lost something . 

i didn't always feel this sedated . "" 

with that piece of dialogue , we are fully introduced to lester burnham ( kevin spacey ) , a 42 year old man trapped within his own life . 

lester works for an advertising agency . 

his growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the mid-life crisis he is suffering . 

estranged from both his wife and his daughter , lester starts to crack under the stress . 

his life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies , and sullen apathy . 

carolyn burnham ( annette bening ) , is the prototypical career woman/ homemaker . 

she carefully tends her rose garden , decorates her home with the best furnishings . 

but inside she is desperate . 

unsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent , she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family . 

the third member of this anti-family is jane burnham ( thora birch ) , lester and carolyn's daughter . 

a young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence , but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction . 

this funny ( and frightening ) slice of life is refreshingly simple . 

not one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her . 

some of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight other characters . 

most notably is barbara fitts ( allison janney ) , the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts . 

she has almost no dialogue , and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one . 

colonel fitts ( chris cooper ) is an angry and frightened man . 

his rage directed almost singularly at his son , ricky ( wes bentley ) who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnham's . 

in fact they are the next door neighbors . 

anymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in "" american beauty "" . 

alan ball , who was the co-executive producer of the hit tv series "" cybil "" and creator of the new sitcom "" oh grow up "" , has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years . 

not one character in this film rings falsely . 

and the depth of personality in each , is achingly honest and insightful . 

the plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as "" the graduate "" or "" lolita "" . 

kevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances . 

his lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is spiraling into old age . 

finally unable to deal with the lost soul that he has become , lester tries to return to his youth . 

he quits his job ( actually blackmailing his employer for one year's salary ) , starts smoking pot , fantasizes about his daughter's girlfriend angela ( mena suvari , in a marvelous performance here ) , starts working out , and finally takes a job at the local fast food outlet . 

mr . spacey's performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous , that we can be certain that come oscar ? time , we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees . 

annette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career . 

carolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy . 

unable to cope with her growing disillusionment , she forces herself to maintain her demeanor , driving her further and further into desperation , adultery and possibly murder . 

ms . bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone . 

the slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words . 

thora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her . 

jane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is a dysfunctional family , and a rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment . 

her growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as a warning . 

she is the prototypical trophy child . 

when carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team ( "" i'm so proud of you , honey . 

you didn't screw up once ! "" ) , the bitterness and resentment are palpable . 

thora birch is a young actress to watch . 

praise must also go to chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance . 

colonel finn is a man in complete denial . 

his military upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend . 

wes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma . 

the boy next door who may be more foe than friend . 

a deceitful and calculating young man , whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults around him . 

mr . bentley's performance is the one troublesome note in the film . 

that is simply because the character is such a grand and complete liar , that one almost faults the performance for it . 

director sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings with a sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle . 

scenes of carolyn walking through the rain , carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character . 

the subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful , capturing the season in all of it's harsh beauty ( fall has never looked so inviting , yet depressing ) . 

every nuance of "" american beauty "" begs it's audience to think and examine . 

it is a film that will be discussed and debated for years to come . 

and well it should , as it is simply one of this years best . 
"
"capsule : side-splitting comedy that follows its own merciless logic almost through to the end . . . 

but not without providing a good deal of genuine laughs . 

most comedies these days have one flaw . 

they're not funny . 

they think they're funny , but they are devoid of anything really penetrating or dastardly . 

occasionally a good funny movie sneaks past the deadening hollywood preconceptions of humor and we get a real gem : ruthless people , for instance , which established a microcosm of a setup and played it out to the bitter end . 

liar liar is built the same way and is just about as funny . 

this is one of the few movies i've seen where i was laughing consistently almost all the way through : instead of a couple of set-pieces that inspired a laugh ( think of the dismal fatal instinct ) , the whole movie works like clockwork . 

jim carrey playes a high-powered lawyer , to whom lying is as natural as breathing . 

there is one thing he takes seriously , though : his son , and we can sense the affection that they have for each other right away . 

but his wife is divorced and seeing another man , and now it looks like they may move away together . 

the son goes with them , of course . 

the movie sets up this early material with good timing and a remarkable balance of jim carrey's over-the-top persona with reality . 

then the plot springs into action : after being snubbed ( not deliberately ) by his father at his birthday , the kid makes a wish as he blows out the birthday candles : that for just one day , dad can't lie . 

he gets the wish . 

what happens next is sidesplitting . 

everything turns into a confrontation : when cornered by a bum for some change , he shouts , "" no ! 

i'm not giving you any money because i know you'll spend it on booze ! 

all i want to do is to get to the office without having to step over the debris of our decaying society ! "" 

he can't even get into an elevator without earning a black eye . 

and what's worse , he's now gotten himself into an expensive divorce settlement that requires him to twist the truth like abstract wire sculpture . 

carrey , who i used to find unfunny , has gotten better at his schtick , even if it's a limited one . 

he uses it to great effect in this movie . 

there is a scene where he tries to test his ability to lie and nearly demolishes his office in the process ( there's a grin breaking out across my face right now , just remembering the scene ) . 

he can't even write the lie ; his fingers twitch , his body buckles like someone in the throes of cyanide poisoning , and when he tries to talk it's like he's speaking in tongues . 

equally funny is a scene where he beats himself to a pulp ( don't ask why ) , tries to drink water to keep from having outbursts in the courtroom ( it fails , with semi-predictable results ) , and winds up biting the bullet when he gets called into the boardroom to have everyone ask what they think of them . 

this scene alone may force people to stop the tape for minutes on end . 

the movie sustains its laughs and also its flashes of insight until almost the end . 

a shame , too , because the movie insists on having a big , ridiculous climax that involves carrey's character flagging down a plane using a set of motorized stairs , then breaking his leg , etc . a simple reconciliation would do the trick . 

why is this stupid pent-up climax always obligatory ? 

it's not even part of the movie's real agenda . 

thankfully , liar liar survives it , and so does carrey . 

maybe they were being merciful , on reflection . 

if i'd laughed any more , i might have needed an iron lung . 
"
"so ask yourself what "" 8mm "" ( "" eight millimeter "" ) is really all about . 

is it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy , sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography ? 

is it about the business itself , how , bubbling just beneath the surface of big-town americana , there's a sordid world of sick and depraved people who won't necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires ? 

or is it about those who can , those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see ? 

i'm not talking about snuff films , supposed "" documentaries "" of victims being brutalized and killed on camera . 

i'm talking about films like "" 8mm "" and its director , joel schumacher . 

with a recent run of big budget movies to his credit-- "" batman & robin , "" "" a time to kill , "" "" batman forever , "" "" the client "" --schumacher certainly has that kind of influence . 

is "" 8mm "" something you really want to see ? 

probably not . 

the first two-thirds of "" 8mm "" unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama , albeit with a particularly unsavory core . 

then , as it's been threatening all along , the film explodes into violence . 

and just when you think it's finally over , schumacher tags on a ridiculous self-righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further . 

trust me . 

there are better ways to waste two hours of your life . 

nicolas ' "" snake eyes "" ' cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether a reel of film found in her late husband's safe documents a young girl's murder . 

welles goes about his assignment rather matter-of-factly , and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly , almost as if you don't need any specialized skills or training to do this . 

welles certainly makes it look easy . 

and cops , obviously , never look in toilet tanks for clues . 

the deeper welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes , like george c . scott in paul schrader's "" hardcore . "" 

occasionally , a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through a film projector , reminding him of his unpleasant task . 

there are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife , played by catherine keener , who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly split-level home in harrisburg , pa . 

 "" 8mm "" doesn't condemn or condone its subject matter , it just exploits it . 

the irony , of course , is that schumacher and "" seven "" scribe andrew kevin walker's vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an r-rated , first-run hollywood product . 

so we only see snippets of snuff , and a lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror . 

later it's the turn of joaquin phoenix ( who's quite good and by far the film's most interesting character as adult bookstore flunky max california ) to cover his face as the horrid thing is screened over and over again . 

all this to get to the familiar yet offensive "" revelation "" that sexual deviants are not , indeed , monsters but everyday people like you and me . 

neither super nor standard , "" 8mm "" is shocking only in its banality .

same old attitude . 

don't forget to recommend a film , read the journal , or send me some of that nasty hate mail . ) 

starring bruce willis , billy bob thornton , liv tyler , ben affleck written by jonathan hensleigh and j . j . 

abrams directed by michael bay 

it rocks-actually , lots of rocks fly at us or from us , in slow or fast motion , at several points in the film . 

they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward , and when they land-once in a while , when we need a break from the space sequences-they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like . 

 ( nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur . ) 

they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon , a steroid user's answer to deep impact . 

bruce willis stars as harry stamper , a famed oil-driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond "" zero barrier "" and destroys our planet . 

why an oil driller ? 

they require someone experienced with deep-core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid . 

 ( in one unintentionally ( ? ) 

hilarious sequence , nasa asks harry to inspect a deep-core driller they built based on his own blueprints ; it is poorly constructed-harry criticizes almost every aspect of it . 

we trust nasa to build space shuttles that can land on twirling asteroids ? ) 

harry assembles the obligatory "" ragtag "" bunch of "" cowboys "" , including a blond guy , a fat guy , a black guy , a wiseass , and the man who is sleeping with his daughter ( affleck ) . 

once they reach space , we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong-perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it ; i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes . 

whether or not they save the day , i will not reveal . 

nor will you care . 

i will say this : you know you're in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope . 

willis has barely a chance to come alive ; ditto for affleck . 

their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act , in a last minute-and futile-attempt to inject warmth into the material . 

steve buscemi's character-the wiseass-is exceptionally problematic . 

 "" rockhound "" , as he's called , is sarcastic and foolish , so they tape him to a chair , where he spends most of the film . 

so why did they bring him up there to begin with ? 

rather , why write him into the film ? -give 

his almost-witty one-liners to serious willis , who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies : at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter , firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig . 

i'm guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel , at least in my world where the sky is blue . 

liv tyler is pretty and humourless , as always ; suspiciously , four of her father's band's ( "" aerosmith "" ) songs grace the soundtrack . 

director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick , like ketchup , eventually drowning the movie on-screen . 

 ( the middle hour is a non-sensical , pyrotechnic assault on the average primate's brain . ) 

whenever someone dies in this movie , a crew member inevitably yells out "" we lost ( insert dead person's last name here ) ! "" 

i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil-guy-cum-astronaut from a live one , and close-ups of the corpses' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance , as their skin was often covered in fake blood . 

armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla . 

it looks nicer , and has fewer plot-holes within its equally ludicrous framework . 

it has a vivid soundmix . 

but at almost two-and-a-half hours , i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story . 

the love story has been played up in the ads , perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic-fever . 

bollocks ! 

the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout-erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car-sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon-crawler . 

remember a little film called jaws ? 

in this film , three independent-minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark . 

they didn't much like each other at first ; eventually , they started to respect one another . 

one of jaws' great scenes involved the would-be-ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories . 

this is the sort of male-bonding foreign to bay or his producer , jerry bruckheimer , who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we'll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end . 

not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances-i'd be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before "" action "" was called . 

a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don't bare their souls , who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest-beating bravery . 

to this , i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic , nor brave , nor smart , even : this team couldn't build a birdhouse . 

and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer-a trailer for a movie written by a team of body-builders and greeting card authors-i've never been a prouder wimp my whole life .

"joe versus the volcano is really one of the worse movies made in very recent memory . 

the strangest thing is that you would think nothing would go wrong with it . 

it has a solid cast with tom hanks & meg ryan as the lead roles . 

but you can never judge a movie by its cast . . . 

if there is one good thing about joe vs the volcano , it is that the plot is original . 

unfortunately , it is also incredibly stupid . 

the movie begins with joe ( tom hanks ) going to work . 

this opening sequence is very boring and slow . 

it shows joe walking to his office . 

but on the way , he has to wait in a long line passing by strange and slightly depressing scenery with obnoxious lighting . 

a sequence like this should take 2 minutes . 

here , it takes over 5 . . . 

it is obvious that joe hates his job . 

at his office , one of his co-workers is meg ryan . 

oddly enough , she plays 3 different roles in this movie ! ! 

joe leaves to go to a doctor's appointment . 

his doctor informs him that he has a "" brain cloud . "" 

this means that in a few months , he will die . 

so what does joe do ? 

quit his job , of course ! ! 

when he arrives home , joe meets an old man named graynamore ( lloyd bridges ) . 

graynamore tells joe that in order to get some important mineral for his company from an island , the natives need someone to sacrifice to their volcano to please their fire god . 

by a startling coincidence , the boat trip to the island takes a few months . 

by the time he reaches the island , he will almost be dead from the "" brain cloud "" anyway , so joe agrees . 

graynamore gives joe a credit card to buy everything he needs to go on this "" great adventure "" . 

joe goes on a date with meg ryan , his co-worker . 

the day before the boat trip , joe meets one of graynamore's daughters . 

she is also , surprise , meg ryan . 

except she looks more hippyish . 

they both have dinner and the next day , joe gets driven over to his boat . 

the lady that sails the boat is another one of graynamore's daughters . 

and , wonder of wonders , she is also played by meg ryan . 

as they sail to the island , meg ryan tells joe that the natives of the island have a craving for orange soda . 

after some stupid talking scenes , they also deduce that graynamore had his doctor be the one that joe went to . 

and that the "" brain cloud "" thing was made up ! ! 

they do plently of cheap special effects on the boat voyage . 

joe goes fishing and catches a hammerhead shark . 

this is a cheap gag that has been pulled off many times . 

but , to top it off , the shark is obviously rubber and fake ! ! 

one night there is a storm . 

a cheap-looking lightning bolt strikes the boat and everything is cast overboard . 

fortunately , joe and meg ryan manage to find some of the luggage that joe brought to sail . 

by pure luck , they get to the island . 

since the natives like orange soda , they wear soda cans as attire ! ! 

stupid or what ? 

 ; ) before joe leaps in the volcano , he gets fed . 

right before he jumps , meg ryan pleads him not to . 

when joe decides to , she goes in with him because "" she loves him "" . 

now this is where the movie should end . 

but , unfortunately , the "" cheesy ending "" bug comes in . 

the volcano blows the couple out and into the ocean where they land on joe's luggage . 

they float to another part of the island as they watch lava pouring out of the volcano towards the villagers . 

i give this movie a . 

see it only if you're a film buff that enjoys a bad movie every now and then or if you really like tom hanks or meg ryan . . .

"while watching boiler room , i was constantly reminded of last year's masterpiece fight club . 

both films consist of a predominately male cast . 

both films follow young men as they illicitly fight the traditional system for their own desires . 

and both films are seen through the eyes of one narrator , who eventually realizes that these men have to be stopped . 

while boiler room writer/director ben younger does not get his point across as well as david fincher does for fight club , he does contribute another impressive work to a series of films aiming to represent the new generation . 

a generation which has seen the internet prosper and where everyone wants to be a millionaire . 

paying homage to oliver stone's 1987 classic wall street , younger is almost modernizing the tale by using younger , hipper actors to play the greedy villains as opposed to the older , more experienced types . 

as is true in real life , younger minds are becoming richer and richer from their knowledge of more standard technology . 

boiler room dismisses the notion of ingenuity and shows that greed and desire for power come in all ages . 

another similarity with fight club is that both films are not action flicks . 

some people are convinced that an all-male cast automatically means there must be gory violence , here is proof that this is not true . 

if you want to see an action movie starring ben affleck , go see reindeer games this weekend . 

if you want to see a smart , insightful film with excellent acting and a clever script , see boiler room . 

giovanni ribisi gives an outstanding performance as the film's narrator , seth . 

after dropping out of college and running a lucrative gambling center for college students in his apartment , seth is offered a high paying job by a wealthy man ( nicky katt ) . 

he agrees to take the job ( in which you are guaranteed to become a millionaire within three years ) of selling stock to well-off americans from the mid-west over the telephone and begins to fit in quite well with his co-workers . 

learning tricky techniques to deceive innocent people into buying shares of a good in production , seth figures this is too good to be true . 

after stumbling into a room at the wrong time , he knows there is something no good about this company . 

at this point , seth is left with the ultimate choice ; continue with the american dream and make millions or tell the authorities that something fishy is going on . 

ribisi is believable as seth especially when he shares scenes with ron rifkin , playing seth's dad . 

the two have perfect chemistry as a troubled father and son trying to impress each other and simultaneously impress themselves . 

the transitions from anger to sympathy that these scenes contain are the standout segments of the entire film . 

the supporting cast of greedy co-workers is also flawless . 

ben affleck shines in a short but sweet performance as a recruiter for the company , nicky katt is fabulous as the ostensibly friendly boss who eventually becomes extremely jealous of seth , and vin diesel gives his best performance of his career as the foil character of nicky katt . 

the energy of the cast as a whole makes boiler room well paced and never boring . 

the only major error in the film is that nothing major happens . 

there is no big plot twist or climatic point to make the film more memorable . 

due to the lack of a major event , boiler room never finds a suitable genre to fit into . 

the movie is not intense enough to be a thriller , the romantic segments involving seth and abby ( nia long ) are not properly finalized , and the dialogue isn't funny enough to make it a comedy . 

in having trouble to characterize the movie as a whole , boiler room is slightly confused at times . 

it doesn't seem to know which category to fit itself into . 

one satisfying concluding scene could have changed the whole film for the better . 

otherwise , the movie is fun to watch thanks to its lively cast of young actors . 
"
"in "" the sweet hereafter , "" writer/director atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tragedy of living . 

he shows us how it isn't dying that hurts , but rather the pain of living in the hereafter of death , and dealing with the loss and grief that it brings . 

on a cold winter day in a small , isolated town in british columbia , a school bus full of children slides off the highway and onto a frozen lake , where it cracks through the ice and sinks . 

fourteen children die , and numerous others are hurt . 

for the residents of this small town , all of whose children were on that bus , it is an earth-shattering event that resolutely alters their lives . 

they have always relied on each other in the past to deal with heartache and pain , but it seems that this tragedy is more than they can handle . 

alberta and risa walker , who own a local motel and lost their child in the accident , hire an attorney named mitchell stephens ( ian holm ) to bring a lawsuit against someone , anyone for responsibility . 

the bus driver , dolores driscoll ( gabrielle rose ) , is a kindly woman who loved the children and , although she lives with a burden of guilt , is not held responsible for the accident . 

the bus seems to have simply slipped on some ice , and there was nothing should could do to prevent it . 

however , according to stephens , there are no "" accidents "" in life , and someone will pay for this tragedy , whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through . 

he goes through the town , approaching the parents who have lost children , asking them to join the class action suit and find vent for their anger . 

and , for his work , stephens will receive one-third of the settlement money . 

however , it is immediately apparent that stephens has little or no interest in the money . 

he is driven by something else , something deeper that he shares in common with the grieving parents . 

he has lost a child , too , but not in the same manner . 

his daughter , zoe ( caerthan banks ) , who once almost died in his arms as a young child after a spider bite , has been in and out of drug re-hab clinics and detox stations for ten years . 

she calls him on an irregular basis , begging him for money , but refusing to tell him what she needs it for . 

 "" i don't know who i'm taking to , "" he tells her . 

in his mind , his daughter is dead . 

the lawsuit is , to stephens , not only a way to mend the town's pain , but also his own . 

however , not everyone in town wants it to happen . 

billy ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who was driving behind the bus when the accident happened and lost two children , wants nothing to do with it . 

he has already lost his wife , and he buries his grief in an affair with a married woman . 

he doesn't want to talk about the accident , and he sees the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds . 

to him , the town should be able to take care of its own pain , and it doesn't need outsiders like stephens getting in the way . 

central to "" the sweet hereafter "" is the tale of nicole burnell ( sarah polley ) , a teenage girl who dreams of being a singer before the accident turned her into "" a wheelchair girl , "" as she puts it . 

aside from stephens , nicole is the most complex character in the film , and it is she who ultimately decides the fate of the town and how the lawsuit will turn out . 

it is also her sad , haunted voice that we often hear on the soundtrack , reading robert browning's poem about the pied piper , and how when he led all the town's children away , one was left behind because he was crippled . 

obviously , nicole is that child , and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest of the town's children left her alone by dying in the wreck . 

her situation is further complicated because she is involved in a loving , but incestuous relationship with her father ( tom mccamus ) . 

there is only one , fleeting scene that suggests this relationship , but it is somehow tied into the final act of the film . 

of all the storylines in "" the sweet hereafter , "" this is the most complicated and unresolved , although its implications stretch throughout the entirety of the film . 

egoyan knows that the kinds of questions he brings up have no simple answers -- if any at all -- and he doesn't condescend to the audience by trying to neatly wrap it up . 

what egoyan has done in "" the sweet hereafter "" is really nothing short of miraculous . 

in his adaptation of the novel by russell banks , he has made a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending the pettiness of law and driving headlong into the deeper meaning of what is loss , and how pitiful monetary and material possessions are when compared to human life . 

egoyan has always been a talented , but distant and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold . 

 "" the sweet hereafter "" is quite the opposite ; egoyan's stylistic and narrative structures work brilliantly to heighten the impact of the natural emotion , and draw the audience into the tragedy . 

 "" the sweet hereafter "" seems to contain the combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked . 

the film is filled with beautiful , subtle performances from all the actors , especially ian holm as the lawyer and sarah polley as the sad child who was left behind . 

the beautiful , roving camerawork by paul sarossy and the haunting , melodic musical score by mychael danna ( both previous egoyan collaborators ) give the film a visual and aural cohesiveness with the thematic elements . 

like his earlier films , egoyan weaves together multiple storylines that form a blanketing whole . 

he works with time as a fluid substance , shifting back and forth between the past , the distant past , and the present with effortless ease . 

the actual bus wreck itself doesn't happen until midway through the film , but by that time the event has built up so much emotion that egoyan can film it from a distance with no graphic detail , and still have it carry great , devastating weight . 

because human life has become such a cheap commodity in movies , it is astounding that egoyan can convey so much heartbreak in such simple , direct terms . 

certainly one of the best films of 1997 , "" the sweet hereafter "" is a deeply rewarding , mystifying , and ultimately human film . 
"
"good films are hard to find these days . 

great films are beyond rare . 

proof of life , russell crowe's one-two punch of a deft kidnap and rescue thriller , is one of those rare gems . 

a taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting , an intelligent script , and masterful directing , together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days , genuine motivation in a story that rings true . 

consider the strange coincidence of russell crowe's character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryan's character in the film -- all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world . 

i haven't seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah's masterpiece , the getaway . 

but enough with the gossip , let's get to the review . 

the film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman ( david morse ) , an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti-government soldiers . 

upon discovering his identity , the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for $6 million . 

the only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off , and no one will step forward with the money . 

with no choice available to her , bowman's wife alice ( ryan ) hires terry thorne ( crowe ) , a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative , to arrange the return of her husband . 

but when things go wrong -- as they always do in these situations -- terry and his team ( which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year : david caruso ) take matters into their own hands . 

the film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates a complex and intelligent character-driven vehicle filled with well-written dialogue , shades of motivation , and convincing acting by all the actors . 

the script is based on both a book ( the long march to freedom ) and a magazine article pertaining to kidnap/ransom situations , and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy , screenwriter of the devil's advocate and dolores claiborne . 

the biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan , but that between crowe and david caruso . 

dug out from b-movie hell , caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowe's right hand gun while providing most of the film's humor . 

ryan cries a lot and smokes too many cigarettes , david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him , and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as the stoic , gunslinger character of terry thorne . 

the most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes . 

the bulk of those scenes , which bookend the movie , work extremely well as establishment and closure devices for all of the story's characters . 

the scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise . 

director taylor hackford mixes both his old-school style of filmmaking with the dizziness of a lars von trier film . 

proof of life is a thinking man's action movie . 

it is a film about the choices men and women make in the face of love and war , and the sacrifices one makes for those choices -- the sacrifices that help you sleep at night .

"when i saw the trailer for "" the sixth sense , "" i didn't expect much from it . 

my snap judgment was that it was a watered-down version of "" the shining "" or possibly a late-entry in the glut of angel-related movies/tv shows of a couple years ago . 

but all the buzz motivated me to give it a shot . 

it turned out to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year . 

bruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe . 

at the beginning of the movie , he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work , but he is soon confronted by vincent , a patient malcolm failed years earlier ( donnie wahlberg-former new kid-in an impressive cameo ) . 

a year passes , and malcolm is treating another child with the same symptoms vincent displayed . 

cole sear ( haley joel osment ) is a withdrawn kid who is called "" freak "" by the other boys in the neighborhood . 

weird things seem to happen around cole-his mother ( olivia williams ) leaves the kitchen for a moment and returns to find every cabinet and drawer open even though cole hasn't moved-and cole seems to know things that a kid his age shouldn't-for example , that there was once a gallows in his school . 

he steals religious icons from churches to build a chapel in a pup tent in his bedroom . 

the trailer gave away the movie's first major plot twist . 

if it hadn't , the first hour of the movie would be more engrossing because we wouldn't know what's wrong with cole . 

if you're lucky enough to have not seen the trailer , stop reading this review right now and go see "" the sixth sense . "" 

anyway , since the trailer gave it away , i figure it's fair game to discuss here . 

once malcolm gains cole's trust , cole reveals his secret : he sees ghosts everywhere . 

dead people wander around not knowing that they're dead , invisible to everyone except cole . 

malcolm gradually begins to realize that cole is telling the truth . 

the box office success of "" the sixth sense "" has generated a lot of press about how horror movies rule the box office this year and lots of theories about why that's so . 

i hate to burst anybody's bubble , but "" the sixth sense "" isn't really a horror film . 

at its core , "" the sixth sense "" is a touching story of how a troubled kid and an emotionally-scarred adult help each other to move past their problems . 

some scenes with the ghosts are wonderfully creepy , though . 

one that really got to me : the ghost of a boy says to cole , "" i'll show you where my dad keeps his gun "" ; when the ghost turns , we see the bullet wound in the back of his head . 

osment gives the best performance i've ever seen from a child actor . 

it's hard enough to find a grown-up in hollywood who can give a subtle , realistic portrayal ! 

although willis gets top billing , cole is really the protagonist of the story , and osment truly brings the complex kid to life . 

if only willis' work were as impressive . 

accustomed to delivering catchphrases rather than dialogue , willis is stiff and awkward as malcolm , his most challenging role to date . 

 ( this is a bad omen for his next movie , "" the story of us , "" which chronicles the ups and downs of a marriage ) . 

writer/director m . night shyamalan has a light , poetic touch that goes to the heart of the viewer without seeming sappy or trite . 

he's also a skillful storyteller , as the movie's ending demonstrates . 

only when the final secret is revealed do you realize that shyamalan has been hinting at it throughout the movie . 

look for a cameo by the director as a doctor who treats cole . 

bottom line : osment should get an oscar nomination , and you should go see this movie .

"do you want to know the truth about cats and dogs ? 

do you ? 

well , as this movie shows us , they make good companions but pale in comparison to the joy and fulfillment romantic relationships can bring . 

unfortunately , there's a giant roadblock set up in our culture that only certain people can get through while the rest of us mill around outside , feeling sorry for ourselves . 

a checkpoint beautiful kind of thing , and janeane garafolo's character abby relates to it well . 

like a certain oversized teenage movie critic , she is intelligent and has a great sense of humor but strikes out with the opposite sex because she sees herself as physically unattractive , and the men seem to be backing her up on that . 

meanwhile , her gorgeous neighbor nora ( uma thurman . . . 

uma being the only woman's name worse than nora ) attracts men like flies . 

as abby tells her , "" you burp and they think it's cute . 

you barf and they line up to hold your hair back . "" 

but nora's down on herself for being too shallow and superficial . 

we all have our prwhen a man calls in to veterinarian abby's talk radio show wanting to know how to get the roller skates off his basset hound . 

 ( oh come on , any idiot knows how to handle that problem ! ) 

he likes her personality and professional demeanor and asks to meet her in person . 

abby , though , knows her body doesn't match her personality and that she probably won't have a chance with him once he sees her . 

so she gives him nora's body description and stands him up . 

nora happens to be in the studio the next day when the dog man comes by and abby asks her for a big favor . 

she goes along with the masquerade and the three of them head out for a night of fun , abby assuming the role of a goat cheese farmer named donna . 

the dog man finds out even though this girl is beautiful , she's not quite as intellectual or confident about herself in person , but he doesn't suspect anything , realizing he's not living in a "" three's company "" episode . 

the charade continues , with abby furthering the relationship over the phone ( including a decidedly unnecessary phone sex/masturbation sequence ) and nora furthering it in person , while eventually finding herself attracted to the dog man . 

like sleepless in seattle , this comedy/romance is predictable all the way through , but we care enough about the characters that we root them on and will the romance to blossom . 

the truth about cats and dogs isn't quite as entertaining as i was expecting it to be , but it handles well a theme i could identify with . 

the thing is , i find janeane garafolo rather attractive . 

she's no uma but i'm sure in real life she'd have no problems attracting men . 

i , on the other hand , couldn't attract a man to save my life . . . 

and am rather proud of that fact .

"capsule : the best place to start if you're a jackie chan newcomer . 

roars along , never stops for breath , and frequently hilarious . 

to talk about jackie chan as a "" stuntman "" is to miss a million things . 

jackie is not only one of the most accomplished and fearsomely unafraid physical adepts on the screen today , but also a very funny guy . 

he reminds me of the way arnold schwartzenegger * used * to make me laugh -- he's funny just standing there , copping a look . 

supercop has jackie making us laugh , scream , duck , root , and gasp for breath , often all in the same scene . 

it's actually the third in a loosely related series of movies , each with jackie playing kevin chan , a hong kong policeman who has a knack for getting neck-deep into trouble and then karate-kicking his way out of it . 

 ( the others are also worth seeing . ) 

it's a little slow to start , but once it gets moving , it's a field day . 

the movie has a fairly sophisticated plot for movies of this kind . 

kevin is tapped for a dangerous dea assignment to be accomplished in mainland china , which requires him to collaborate with the attractive ( and ass-kicking ) chief fo chinese security ( played here by the ever-enjoyable michelle yeoh ) . 

there's a fun chemistry between the two of them , especially in an early scene where she tries to brief him and he keeps making wondering comments about how great she looks in that uniform . 

kevin is assigned to help spring a known gangster from jail -- all undercover , of course -- and have him lead the two of them to a noted drug boss . 

the drug boss , however , has problems of his own : his wife's on trial for many of his own crimes , and she's got the key to an account with all of his drug funds . 

this means , of course , endless trouble -- not the least of which is that kevin bumps into his girlfriend while he's out in the field , and she sees him with this other woman , and . . . but that's one of the movie's unique pleasures : the way it crosses from action to comedy effortlessly . 

action . there is , of course , non-stop action in this movie -- everything from one-on-one kung fu to all-out gun battles to a sppedboat with eight engines ( ! ) 

outrunning the hong kong coast guard . 

there is also a virtuoso climax , which features , among other things , jackie danging from a ladder tied to a helicopter , a wrong-way freeway chase ( which requires michelle to do an awesomely difficult handstand stunt ) , a fight on top of a moving train that also involves the 'copter as well as a motorcycle . 

you get the idea . 

this is to action movies what a burger with everything on it is to fast food : quick , enjoyable , filling . 

watch it with friends . 

when they stop making movies like this , the world will be a tad greyer .

"after the huge success of "" the exorcist "" in 1973 a sequel was inevitable , and sadly like most horror fims that make money , the filmmakers decided to make a ridiculous sequel , that makes absolutely no sense at all , and to me was extremely pointless , wasting linda blair and max von sydow completely . 

needless , dumb sequel flopped in the box office , and never gained much success though it is voted as one of the worst sequels of all time , to which i agree with . 

to start the "" story "" it is four years later , and regan is being tormented by memories of what used to be , now a priest played by richard burton , is trying to figure out why this demon tried to possess regan , and now the demon somehow wants to possess her again ( maybe she was good or something ) . 

now they must try to stop this demon from taking over regan's body , before it is too late . 

some of the bad things exorcist ii has in it is : linda blair , she had no need to revive her character , and she is really terrible in this film , she brings it down to a lull , and in places it seems like it just stops in its place , and doesn't go anywhere . 

louise fletcher is alright for what it's worth , but she could have done a lot better than this . 

the direction by john boorman , is that of a confused , stylish nature that i really couldn't figure out . 

in fact , i had no idea what was going on in this film , the script was jumbled , the plot was jumbled , and the ending is just laugh out loud hilariosly bad . 

for those exorcist fans who haven't seen this one , i recommend renting it . 

i actually gave this one a high rating , if it were any worse it would have deserved zero pumpkins , i went easy on it however because of the fact that it has a bit of good direction , but nothing else ! 

im not saying i like the film now , so dont start going anywhere . 

bad , bad , bad movie .

"robin williams , this time without a beard , returns to drama in this sloppy , sickly sweet fantasy with few redeeming features apart from the incredible effects . 

he plays chris nielsen , who meets annie ( annabella sciora ) and promptly marries her . 

they have two great kids , who sadly die in a car crash . 

just when it couldn't get any worse , chris gets killed in a car crash , and goes to heaven where he meets his guide albert ( gooding jnr . ) 

annie can't take the grief anymore , and kills herself . 

 ( all sounding like good fun so far ? ) 

the 'penalty' for suicide is to go to hell , and chris goes on a mission to try and rescue her using the help of the traveller ( max von sydow . ) 

based on a novel by twilight zone writer richard matheson , what dreams may come is clunky , manufactured material doused with a extra load of sugar . 

this is the worse spielberg film spielberg never made . 

everything is wrong about this movie : the performances are forced , and the audiences fail to relate to any of the characters . 

williams puts on a convincing upset face , but that's all it is : a face . 

there's no emotion behind it . 

sciora's performance is lazy , and bogs down the whole film . 

she may look pretty , but she can't act . 

max von sydow is o . k as the traveller , if nothing special . 

cuba gooding jnr , thankfully , adds some bounce to his performance , and is certainly the best performer in the film . 

it's a shame that his character is so flat and 2-d , and offers no room for improvement . 

all the performers have to work with a soppy script , that tries it's best to get some emotion going , but never takes off the ground . 

there are _some_ scenes which could be real heartwarmers , but the faceless characters don't help to get anything out of the performers . 

while films like e . t used great actors , music and direction to pull of a masterful heart-tugging scene , what dreams may come is haphazard , expecting the emotion to come out of the scene automatically . 

instead , it's all rather boring . 

sure , the music is pretty ( by michael kamen ) and the cinematography isn't bad ( by eduardo serra ) but there's something lacking . 

the script doesn't help , filled with hopeless romantic clich ? s , and dud speeches . 

richard matheson can write some awesome science fiction stories , sadly this novel would look embarrassed in a bargain bin , let alone being converted into a $70 million vehicle for robin williams . 

despite being set in heaven , what dreams may come is mightily depressing . 

the film rushes a happy ending , but everything before this is very , very sad and black , which just adds to make the ending even more hopeless and stupid . 

but there's one redeeming feature about this failure of a movie : the special effects . 

heaven and hell are truly incredible places , and the actors fit perfectly with the virtual sets . 

but despite this , what dreams may come , proves to be nothing but the biggest disappointment of 1998 . 

instead of raising questions about existence , it raises boredom . 

sadly , i recommend you give this film a miss . 

better luck next time , robin .

"a follow-up to disney's live-action "" 101 dalmatians "" that's better , more entertaining than the first ? 

just as unlikely . 

with "" 102 dalmatians , "" the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs , more is definitely * not * the merrier . 

1996's "" 101 dalmatians "" certainly wasn't the greatest movie-going experience of all time , but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous , larger-than-life performance . 

in addition , we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson , and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies . 

this time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen , and close's facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53-year-old actress under that startling black and white wig of hers . 

but that's only half the problem with kevin lima's laborious film . 

what makes "" 102 dalmatians "" such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor ( here almost single-handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks he's a dog , voiced by eric idle ) , its rabid plotlessness ( cruella goes after puppies again ; winds up in goo again ) and most of all , the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic "" heroes "" of the piece , a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blander-than-bland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo ? . 

gruffudd is cute and harmless , perhaps , but evans can't even aspire to that . 

the dogs upstage them both , of course , but in the case of evans , even close's split ends are more animated . 

bad acting , however , seems to be a requirement for this sequel , since g ? rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niro's in "" men of honor . "" 

jean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant for fine furs and depardieu's over-the-top antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail , and wail for wail . 

france's most popular export besides brie has long since turned into a caricature of himself , and in "" 102 dalmatians "" the producers milk that realization for all it's worth--le pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as "" poopies , "" par example ( and ad nauseum ) . 

the finesses of the script ( attributed to four screenwriters no less , and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up ) are quickly dispensed with , since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben ( ? ) . 

that done , it's back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore off-limits sables and minks and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of a hooded designer gown . 

the dogs are pretty cute--try making a puppy look otherwise--but that's pretty much all they are . 

there's always the feeling that there's a trainer off in the wings , coaxing the dogs to open doors , or pick up their food bowls in unison , or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder . 

savvy holiday goers should skip "" 102 dalmatians "" and pop the original 1961 animated classic into * their * vcrs instead . 

it's one dalmatian less , but 101% more satisfying . 
"
" "" a bug's life "" may not be "" toy story , "" but it's more close than "" antz "" was . 

i really liked "" antz , "" basically because , yes , it is clever and witty and intelligent ( and it has the temerity to take a chance and put woody allen in the lead , perhaps the year's most inspired casting ) , but there was , in fact , something missing from it , and i'm the first to admit that . 

maybe it's that it never totally lets go and takes off into real innocent fun - it's too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging , and if it weren't for woody allen , it would have been just a really clever good-not-great flick . 

 "" a bug's life "" has a similar premise , and it also has disney to insure that it's g-rated and not totally over kids' heads like "" antz "" was ( not a bad thing , believe me ) , but what it also has is a tone that's completely innocent even when it's also remaining perpetually clever . 

 "" antz "" is still the more witty film , and i love it for it , and "" a bug's life "" is more for general consumption , but it's also more entertaining . 

it broadens its horizons , and when it really moves from the ant colony , it really shows us a whole new world we've never seen before , and it's take on the evolution of bugs is a lot better than the one in "" antz . "" 

it's also light and clever . 

the visuals are , instead of earth tones , bright worldly colors , and still gives the amazing visual technology of "" antz "" at least a worthy contender . 

the characters are also nicely realized - though watered-down for broad consumption , they still carry more wit than the contemporary disney animated films . 

the lead character , flik ( voiced by dave foley ) , is nothing more than a slightly-less neurotic z from "" antz , "" but foley makes him nearly as engaging as allen made z . instead of gene hackman playing the villain , we get the much more menacing kevin spacey as the lead grasshopper , the nicely-titled hopper . 

and for the romantic lead , we don't get spacey sharon stone , but intelligent and hard-to-get julia-louis dreyfuss , who doesn't even come around until the very final frames . 

not that the plot's really any better than the one in "" antz "" - it's basically yet another redux of "" the seven samurai , "" with an ant colony under the control of giant grasshoppers forcing them to produce a product for them or else . 

when flik , a bone fide inventor , creates a time-conserving apparatus that accidentally destroys the season's donation , he puts them all in risk , and is sent away so that he won't screw anything up with the pretense that he is searching for help to fight the grasshoppers . 

he runs into a group of "" warrirors "" who are , unbeknownst to him , a group of carnival bugs , and they agree to help under similar false pretenses . 

these bugs are an equally wonderful assortment to anything in "" toy story "" : foppish walking stick slim ( david hyde-pierce ) , german caterpillar heimlich ( joe ranft ) , quick-tempered and insecure male ladybug francis ( denis leary ) , pretentious praying mantis manny ( jonathan harris ) , his assistant butterfly hypsy ( madeliene kahn ) , spider rosie ( bonnie hunt ) , and two fleas , tuck and roll ( michael mcshane ) , who speak in undiscernable jibberish . 

the writers lightly touch on each bug's place in bug society and the malleability thereof while making a wisecracks at everything they can , and blowing the audience away with wild visual treats . 

grasshoppers jumping in unison seems like a menacing earthquake . 

a small bird becomes an ominous mortal threat , whose usual mild-mannered squeal is a scream of death . 

the bug city is a modern-day metropolis , complete with fireflies temping as traffic lights and a fly sitting on the curb , holding out a cup , with a sign lying next to him that says "" kid tore off wings . "" 

and a rainstorm is like a giant flood , with each drop acting like a small bomb dropped at millions of miles per hour . 

around this , the pixar animators stage several large set pieces , like a resuce mission halfway through that is as wild and entertaining as anything this year , and a wonderfully exciting action piece at the end , a chase scene at night through the labyrinthine branches of a small thicket . 

meanwhile , each character gets the spotlight to be completely idisyncratic and interesting , something "" antz "" couldn't do , and by the end , over the end credits , "" a bug's life "" pulls it's final punch , out clever-ing "" antz "" with a series of incessantly hilarious faux-bloopers that come just at the right time , when those who leave immeadiately after the final frame of a film have left , and you can brag that you were one of the elite who stayed and got the full money's worth of entertainment . 

still , it's no "" toy story . "" 

that film , maybe above any animated film i've ever seen , encompassed almost true perfection in story , character , and wit . 

it proved that it didn't need to brag about it's cutting edge technology to really soar ( it's the least visually striking of the three computer animated films thus far , but is still the most satisfying ) , and created a perfect world of idiosyncratic delights and innocent fun . 

yet "" a bug's life , "" as well as "" antz , "" are still amazing films , and prove without doubt , that if you're gonna make a computer animated film , send it to the guys who created these three flicks , evne if they're not working under the same roof .

"you may not have heard of lucas , or if you have , you might not think much of it . 

probably because it stars corey haim , or maybe because it's about a little geek who collects insects , or maybe because it doesn't feature slick one-liners or the chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost a requirement for teen films in the 80's . 

however , you have been missing out on a true masterpeice , the best film of 1986 , and the best film about adolescent life ever made . 

corey haim stars as lucas bligh , a tiny 14 year old with scruffy hair , thick glasses , and an interest in insects and other outdoor life . 

one day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him . 

her name is maggie , a 16 year old who certainly is a beauty , with lovely red hair and a sweet , innocent complexion . 

maggie seems to be a little disturbed by this little kid watching her , but somehow he interests her , and soon they are talking and getting to know one another . 

they gradually become good friends , and spend the summer together doing various things , such as studying insects ( namely locusts , who come out of hiding once every 17 years ) , playing tennis , and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover . 

lucas is obviously in love with maggie , and while she is charmed by him , it's clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend . 

this is not clear to lucas , however . 

he still beleives that maggie is his soulmate , and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows what's about to happen . 

we soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally . 

they throw him on stage , right in front of his beloved maggie . 

surprisingly , he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around , but he takes it too far , and is embarassed in front of the entire school . 

the next scene is brilliant . 

maggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally . 

she tries to talk to him as if nothing happened . 

he rails back against her , in a cruel unfair fashion . 

in lesser movies this would've turned into a confrontation between the two characters . 

but maggie is written smarter than that . 

she understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him . 

next we are introduced to another great character named cappie ( charlie sheen ) . 

he is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend . 

what's interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas and protects him from the other jocks . 

of course anyone with a brain can tell what's gonna happen next . 

cappie will cause conflict in maggie and lucas' relationship . 

this begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie and maggie are alone . 

she's been assigned to show him how to operate the washer/dryer so he can clean his shirt . 

maggie is charmed by cappie's tender undertsanding demeanor , not to mention his shirtless body . 

this scene is so delicate and sweet , but cappie still has a girlfriend , preventing either one from acting on their desires . 

desperately trying to puncture the tension , cappie begins to kick basketballs around the room . 

it's not long before cappie does break up with his girlfriend ( in the films only subpar scene ) . 

lucas finally figures out what's going on when he tries to pick maggie up for the dance . 

this causes him to take severe actions to prove himself to maggie and himself , such as try out for the football team . 

the last third of the film revolves around this attempt . 

while the idea seems cliched , the way it is executed is not . 

there are many surprises during the last half hour which lead to an ending so emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get choked up . 

dave grusin's memorable score , played at the perfect moments , certainly helps . 

lucas is filled with great performances . 

forget everything you know about corey haim . 

back in 1986 he had talent , and that is proven here as he delivers a perfect fully 3-dimensional performance filled with anger , humor , and pain . 

kerri green is very appealing as maggie , showing us why she cares about lucas so much and why he is so attracted to her . 

sheen's cappie is almost too good to be true , but sheen makes him beleivable , especially when he explains the reason why he protects lucas . 

there are other wonderful minor characters such as ciro popitti's ben , a friend of lucas , whose diminutive stature does not mean he will take crap from the jocks . 

also turning up in a few key scenes is winona ryder as rina , the girl who admires lucas from afar . 

when people talk about the great teen angst films of the 80s , you hear john hughes this and john hughes that . 

lucas seems to be lost among the crowd of his so-called classics . 

but hopefully , like with heathers and say anything , lucas can begin to find it's own loyal following and help people realize there were more to the 80s than anthony michael hall and molly ringwald . 

it deserves more than that , but i don't want to be greedy . 
"
"of course i knew this going in . 

why is it that whenever a tv-star makes a movie it's always a romantic comedy , and then they say on entertainment tonight or something , that they were "" attracted to the characters . 

they were really original . "" 

original ? ! let me give you a run-through of picture perfect : character a ) kate ( jennifer aniston , from tv's friends ) , a smart , beautiful , professional woman wants two things she can't have : a new job-title and the love of her co-worker kevin bacon . 

her boss will only give her the job if she gets married and gets a mortgage and gets a lease on a german sportscar , and kevin bacon pnly sleeps with married or involved girls . 

what does she do ? 

she invents a fiance ! 

then when everyone wants to meet him , she tells some poor schmoe she met at a wedding that she will pay him $1000 to pretend to be in love with her for a company dinner , and pick a fight with her at the end , thus breaking the engagement but still being able to keep her job , since the guy ends up looking like a jerk and she is the poor , defenceless female . 

he , of course , goes along with it . 

gee , i wonder if they get together in the end . 

i've seen more original stuff on the wb . 

and better stuff too . 

picture perfect also makes the mistake of being _wayyyyy_ too long at 100 minutes , and expecting us to like aniston's character , who comes off as a cold , spoiled bitch .

"you've got mail is a timely romance for this impersonal , computer-driven decade . 

two people who've never met confide in each other via e-mail without revealing their true identities . 

nora ephron's contemporary update of the shop around the corner retains the basic plot : two people who despise each other unwittingly become enamored with each other through their anonymous correspondence . 

ephron , who co-wrote the film with her sister , delia , as well as directed it , knew what she was doing by reteaming tom hanks and meg ryan as the at-odds couple . 

ryan is kathleen kelly , owner of a small children's bookstore , while hanks is joe fox , who heads up a chain of mega bookstores ( think barnes & noble ) . 

their charm and chemistry are the glue that binds this film , even through some of the script's rough spots . 

for the ephrons invested so much effort in their protagonists that they give short shrift to the talented supporting cast , including parker posey , greg kinnear , jean stapleton and steve zahn . 

yet no one is really going to complain because the ephrons know their audience - and what the paying public wants is hanks and ryan . 

and the two are kept busy . 

one , the other or both are in nearly every scene . 

hanks has his decent guy routine down pat , yet each time he does it , it seems effortless , spontaneous and fresh . 

ryan smoothly moves between spunky and vulnerable , with a sexy touch of winsomeness added to the brew . 

their scenes together sparkle , even though they lack the nostalgic romanticism of sleepless in seattle . 

and the shadow of that earlier hit hangs over you've got mail like dried-up mistletoe . 

the sparks created by the earlier movie are , by necessity , not evident here . 

true , these are two people seeking true love , but you've got mail is more comic and less poignant than its predecessor . 

the ephrons' script is witty and sharp . 

however , as a director nora ephron is a bit uneven . 

some scenes drag , while others , especially when hanks and ryan are revealing their souls via e-mail , are crisp and tidy . 

also , the script gets sloppy toward the end with characters merely disappearing from the story . 

a nice , romantic soundtrack adds to this date-night special . 

overall , you've got mail is a lush and cute outing , taking advantage of the star appeal of its two leads . 

it's a nice holiday movie , one for holding hands and snuggling .

"just in time for halloween and christmas , the reissue of the nightmare before christmas couldn't be more appropriate . 

with all of the attention thrown to "" family films "" in recent years , namely those starring pocket monsters and nickelodeon characters , it's high time we raised the intellectual level of children's fare as well as the animation achievements of the movie studios . 

with that in mind , it was refreshing to revisit an animation classic on the big screen that still retains the originality and freshness it had seven years ago . 

nightmare is the story of one man's quest to discover his true purpose in life -- to look beyond the accolades of his peers , the achievements of his years , and the praise of his ego . 

jack skellington , the pumpkin king of halloweentown , is the main dude behind the halloween holiday for kids everywhere . 

but during his reign as pumpkin king , jack has somehow lost his understanding of his place in the world and the magic he creates with his halloween holiday . 

after the completion of one particular halloween season , jack walks with a heavy heart and ends up discovering in the woods outside halloweentown a grove of trees with doors to all of the other holidays in the world . 

imagine his surprise to discover christmastown , a far more impressive and uplifting holiday than halloween , surrounded by happy elves making toys , and with good cheer all around . 

upon his return to halloweentown , jack decides to combine halloween and christmas together by kidnapping "" sandy claws , "" employing all the residents of halloweentown to build toys for children . 

he then aims to take over the role as primary joy-provider and gift-bearer to the children of the world , in the hopes of rediscovering the zest for life he once had . 

alas , the co-mingling of halloween and christmas creates disastrous results involving shrunken heads , psychotic wooden ducks , a sleigh pulled by a phantom dog with a lighted nose , and a large , sinister , singing bag named oogie boogie 

tim burton -- the man behind such great films as ed wood , beetlejuice , pee-wee's big adventure , and edward scissorhands -- is the creative force behind nightmare . 

originally , burton authored a poem that became the basis of the storyline , and he was jointly involved in the production design of the film ( though many mistakenly assume he directed the picture ) . 

the stamp of burton is clearly everywhere in the film -- with bold colors , imaginative character design , and it's simple yet compelling story . 

the direction of harry selick , who also directed james and the giant peach , is strong , offering intimate views of the strange collection of characters . 

also memorable are the songs in the film , written by former oingo boingo lead singer danny elfman , the next john williams of film composing . 

the nightmare before christmas is intended for both the kid and adult in everyone . 

it's not just child's play for the holidays ; it's a movie about how to be truly happy in a tough world , saying that all you need to do is just be exactly who you are , without compromise . 

what better message is there for christmas ?

"known as the most successful , highest-grossing romantic comedy in history , director garry marshall apparently struck gold with "" pretty woman , "" which opened quietly during the summer of 1990 but , thanks to positive word-of-mouth , was able to reach upwards of $175-million in theaters alone . 

the question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film's two charismatic stars , richard gere and julia roberts , since the story itself is none too original or even believable . 

the other winning element that makes "" pretty woman "" so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence , which is rarely as palpable in today's films as it is here . 

edward lewis ( richard gere ) is a suave , extremely wealthy business mogul who , at the start of the picture , breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument , and abruptly takes his friend's car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel . 

stopping the car along the street , he asks a woman , obviously a prostitute , for directions . 

agreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks , edward ultimately accepts , they strike up a conversation , and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor . 

this meeting does not lead to sex , however , as edward confides that he'd rather just have someone to talk to , and offers her $300 to spend the night . 

just as well , since the hooker , named vivian , is a beautiful , generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear . 

the meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned , when edward finally offers to pay vivian three-thousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area , keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and get-togethers . 

since vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips , which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers , the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act , edward and vivian will finally , truly , kiss . 

allegedly planned as a grim , downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director , "" pretty woman "" has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale , a la "" cinderella . "" 

the premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been . 

you honestly don't need a high-iq ( or any iq , for that matter ) to guess how the film will end , and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha . 

the supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less-than-gratifying , and the screenplay is no award winner . 

and yet , amidst all of these qualms and flaws , "" pretty woman "" is an astoundingly charming motion picture , and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers . 

you'd actually be amazed how far bemusement can go , and there are a few select moments ( not even whole scenes , mind you ) that are as romantic as anything i've seen on film in the 1990's . 

additionally , the film belongs , and its success can be attributed , to two people and two people only , and they are richard gere and julia roberts . 

playing sex symbols throughout the '80s with such pictures as "" american gigolo "" and "" an officer and a gentleman , "" gere branches out here to play a more quiet , almost shy , but still alluring , character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet , and vice versa . 

julia roberts , in her breakthrough role after 1988's well-received "" mistic pizza "" and 1989's "" steel magnolia , "" for which she was nominated for an academy award , is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian , who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers , not for her line of work , but more for her sheer intelligence . 

it would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake , but screenwriter j . f . lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing . 

after "" pretty woman , "" roberts , along with meg ryan , became the reigning queen of romantic comedies ( with her latest being the just-released "" runaway bride , "" which repairs gere and roberts together once again ) , and no wonder . 

roberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy , but also one who can efficiently do drama , and in almost every film she appears in , it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male co-star . 

an especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his co-workers that vivian is actually a prostitute , and he then approaches her , making sexual advances . 

no only does this make vivian feel cheap , especially since she had previously been posing as a more professional , eloquent young lady , but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such a way , and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading , and if she likes this particular path . 

on the more dreamy side , the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold , especially one in which edward enters into the hotel's lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress , but also her inner ( and outer ) glowing beauty . 

another subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward , who is asleep , and placing it on his lips , since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days . 

 "" pretty woman "" does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene , which is a happy ending ( as you'd expect , and wouldn't have it any other way ) that somehow does not work , perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances . 

this one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film , though , because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem . 

helped along by a warm , memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo , as vivian's best friend and roommate , and a fabulously catchy soundtrack , in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movie's overall fulfillment , "" pretty woman "" is a sparkler of a motion picture , and has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy .

"plot : a group of asbestos cleaners get a job removing the gunk from an old insane asylum . 

as each day passes , the crew members begin to discover things about the place and themselves which set other things in motion . 

saying anything else about the plot would be a crime . 

have fun . . . 

critique : "" i feel like shooting myself in the head "" are the first words that came out of my mouth after seeing this movie , a good indication as to what kind of film to expect here . 

this ain't your average "" happy go lucky "" kind of picture . 

this is a deliberately slow-paced mystery-horror film drenched in atmosphere , with a very creepy insane asylum ( in which most of the film takes place ) , very few clues up-front and lots to talk about afterwards . 

will it bore some people to sleep ? 

you bet it will ! 

is it made for the scream audiences of the day ? 

absolutely not ! 

i guess you can describe this film as a horror movie for the "" cerebral crowd "" . 

a film that patiently unwraps itself frame after frame , giving away very little with each step and each sound , unwinding itself until its final scenes offer up a world of revelations and plenty more to discuss later . 

i've always loved movies that have me talking about them afterwards like the shining and lost highway and this film fits right into that group . 

in fact , i guess i can pussyfoot around the actual word all i want but the best way to describe this kind of movie is a "" mindfuck "" . 

if you feel like watching a movie that moves very slowly , gives you a handful of characters with divergent backgrounds , tosses a few very ambiguous and supernatural cookies your way and is extremely disturbing once you put it all together , well , then this movie is definitely for you ! 

it's the kind of film that you actually have to see twice to fully appreciate ( damn , i missed that whole "" peanut butter "" thing ! ) and one that will likely creep the shit out of you if watched alone in the dark . 

 "" brrrrrrrrr . . . now 

what was that sound in the basement ? 

honey , can you go check ? "" 

and one thing this film doesn't have , unlike its hollywood-ian counterparts like the haunting , is special effects . 

in fact , that's one of the greater things about this movie : it feels real because it looks like it's actually taped on video with very credible actors in very credible circumstances ( i did some research and it was , in fact , shot on digital video . . . ah-ha ! ) . 

another great thing about it is that it's actually very gory and somewhat violent in theme , and yet we rarely see anything of the sort on the big screen ( it's mostly implied , kids ! ) . 

and as clich ? d as it might be to say . . . it's usually much scarier when stuff is left to our imagination or implied in movies as such . 

other films that this one reminded me of include henry : portrait of a serial killer and the blair witch project , with that same real sense of dread , brooding and terror . 

the film does however move awfully slow and if you really don't get "" into "" it completely ( you really need to concentrate here ) , you will lose the motion of the story and the pent-up tension might be released . 

but overall , this film is yet another great example of the horror genre making a very cool comeback this year with no tight tanktops in sight . 

and with david caruso acting like the king hotshot like only he can , how can you go wrong ? 

definitely not a film for everyone but a must-see for anyone looking to throw themselves into the psyche of the disturbed ( count me in ! ) . 

stanley kubrick would be proud ! 

oh yeah . . . so 

where's that gun again . . . ? 

where's joblo coming from ? 

the blair witch project ( 4/10 ) - blair witch 2 ( 7/10 ) - the haunting ( 3/10 ) - the house on haunted hill ( 7/10 ) - lost highway ( 10/10 ) - the pledge ( 6/10 ) - the shining ( 9/10 ) - the sixth sense ( 8/10 ) - unbreakable ( 8/10 )

"there's no reason to doubt that donnie brasco is based , as its opening credits proclaim , on a true story . 

but if it's an accurate picture of life on america's mean streets , than cinematic depictions of organised crime have had a much stronger basis in reality than i would have previously thought . 

for from the film's outset , when a group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions on the merits of various automobiles ( not unlike a number of movie lowlifes who recently gave a madonna song a close reading ) donnie brasco resembles more than passingly a few gangster flicks once believed to be works of fiction . 

our eponymous hero ( johnny depp ) is not the cheap crook he first appears to be . 

brasco is joseph pistone , an undercover fbi agent who has the task of chumming-up to lefty ( al pacino ) , a seasoned hood who tutors pistone in the art of being a "" wiseguy "" . 

regrettably , pistone learns his lessons all too well . 

his concern for lefty , who is burdened with a heroin addicted son , exacerbates his own family troubles : his children resent his lengthy absences and his wife fears that her husband's gangster persona is becoming a little too convincing . 

true , the focus on pistone's family life does deviate from the typical gangster-flick formula , but this subplot never rises above its television drama origins . 

the unhappy couple trade predictable lines and engage in drawn-out domestic squabbles ? including an ill-advised marriage guidance routine ? that slow the film down unnecessarily . 

the biggest problem with donnie brasco , however , is that its wiseguy attitude and style lacks the flair of its many predecessors . 

the awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the 70's , but not with the consistent and blindingly tacky style ? i loved those fluoro coloured suits ? of scorces' costume drama casino . 

more importantly , pacino's presence triggers memories of his earlier movie triumphs in which similar territory was covered far more effectively . 

donnie brasco's take on american values , for instance , is feeble and obvious . 

lefty rambles out dreams of material betterment to the accompaniment of grating inspirational music . 

inexplicably , lefty's horatio alger inspired gush is supposed to move us . 

it doesn't any more than his family troubles do , which are dealt in the same saccharine and obvious manner as pistone's . 

just think a minute on how these themes were explored in the godfather movies and scarface . 

in these pictures pacino's dedication to a peculiar and bloody hyper-capitalism was twisted and confronting , while his dogged application of macho wiseguy procedure meant that his relations to friends and family was intriguingly dark ? neither were spared bloody retribution for breaching wiseguy regulations . 

donnie brasco's tawdry little crime , therefore isn't so much its repetition of familiar gangster themes , but the shameless way in which it sanitises them . 

 ( oh and by the way , i forgot to mention that the script also sports a startling subplot : pipstone's superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constant insubordination ? is that a "" damn you mcbain ! "" 

i hear from springfield way ? ) 

so the movie is cliched . 

big deal , what do you expect from a gangster-flick ? 

well you expect quality action sequences and bravado performances in abundance if its going to be a decent example of the genre . 

donnie brasco fails on both counts . 

the action scenes never rise above the ordinary and depp's woeful performance tends to smother the good-work of his comrades . 

admittedly , pacino does nothing new and michael madsen ( sonny ) simply smirks his way through the picture like a slightly subdued mr . white , but both possess an unmistakable sly charm . 

depp usually exhibits a bit of class himself , but regrettably , being in the presence of one of his betters must have left him star-struck , for he is completely hell-bent on mimicking pacino's well-earned high style . 

the consequences are painful to watch . 

its no exaggeration to say that the film's credibility is seriously strained by the sight of the pistone family's uncanny ability to keep a straight face in front of their breadwinner's phony brooklyn accent . 

perhaps we should take pity on the makers of donnie brasco . 

maybe a scrupulous adherence to pinpoint accuracy demanded tiered dialogue and scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic gangster flicks . 

if this is indeed the case , surely the makers of donnie brasco could have explored the fascinating possibility that america's underworld is committed to emulating , albeit in heavily attenuated form , their movie namesakes . 

depp could have poignantly played a simple cop who becomes a hideous parody once he is forced to mimic big-screen gangster greats . 

who knows what insights into the criminal psyche could have arisen ? 

but then again , perhaps donnie brasco isn't so true after all . 
"
"some movies i should just skip . 

my daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back , and here comes another disney effects-filled live-action flick based on an old tv program . 

true , the probgram is only 15 years old this time , and it's a cartoon . 

but it's a cartoon i liked , and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen . 

but my daughter really wanted to go , and how bad could it be ? 

turns out i was right , mostly . 

inspector gadget , oddly enough , follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian , down to the jive-talking side-kick . 

at first i thought it was done by the same people , but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin , where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver . 

this odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it , where "" formula "" isn't just business , it's a way of life . 

the producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits . 

in some parts you can just hear them saying "" more zany ! 

i want more zany here -- and -- here . "" 

 "" let's have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here -- make it really painful . 

i want the audience squirming in their seats . "" 

 "" ok , that's fine , but i want you to add bug guts . "" 

 "" what does this scene do ? 

character depth ? 

but where's the zaniness ? 

i don't see zany here . 

if you can't make it zany , cut it ! "" 

the latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie . 

michelle ( who plays penny , gadget's niece ) shines in every scene she's in , but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time . 

my guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor . 

dabney coleman's comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby . 

i kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film , but instead , he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes . 

he is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the "" gidget bitch from hell "" town mayor . 

oteri's overly enthusiastic and continually self-congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland , oregon's own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasn't poking fun at our fair town . 

or , maybe all career politicians are like that . 

i must say , matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla . 

he appears to have some fun with the film , especially as the evil gadget . 

rupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw . 

joely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself . 

her performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film . 

d . l . hughley plays the shuckin'-and-jivin' vehicular side-kick , in a role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years . 

the dialog is . . . let's face it , it's pretty bad . 

the tag-line after a major set-piece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context . 

a lot of the lines ( especially hughley's ) appear to be made up as they go along , by people with little gift for ad-lib . 

about three-quarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw . 

gadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations ( not really "" battles "" ) with the evil gadget . 

penny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon . 

let me rage here just for a minute . 

michelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character . 

she's utterly charming , and has excellent experience ( harriet the spy ) for the part of the pint-size detective . 

why she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery . 

the film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting ( or editing ) stupidity . 

inspector gadget is missing the long , long stretches of potty humor that ( among other things ) made my favorite martian so unbearable , but it's a very short movie , so perhaps something was cut at the last moment . 

probably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits . 

the "" evil sidekick support group "" is especially worth seeing , and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds it's onscreen . 

all in all , another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films . 

i wonder if disney uses the revenues for it's generally money-making cartoons to produce these losers . 

but if true , why ? 

if they're trying for another mary poppins , they need to find a team that can produce one , and then give them a chance to do it .

"synopsis : leonard shelby ( pearce ) is a former insurance investigator on the trail of the man who killed his wife . 

leonard has only a few clues to the murderer's identity ; to make matters worse , he suffers from a condition which inhibits the creation of short-term memories , meaning that leonard is always forgetting what happened just minutes earlier . 

because of this , leonard is forced to rely on notes he leaves for himself . 

 "" memento "" traces the investigation back in time from its apparent culmination . 

review : "" memento "" is the sort of movie i wish i'd written ; i can think of no higher praise than that . 

i am envious that nolan has concocted such a brilliant , involved , original movie as this . 

an instant film noir classic , "" memento "" is virtually flawless . 

the script is unlike any i have ever seen -- a notable achievement in these days of recycled hollywood homogeneity . 

although the idea of starting at the "" conclusion "" of the plotline and then moving backward in time to the "" start "" is not entirely new , never before have i witnessed it executed with such flair and coherence . 

 "" memento "" is endlessly exciting and inventive , a rare story which keeps the viewers guessing during the film itself , and mulling over its connotations long after leaving the theatre . 

and it is not merely an exercise in cerebrality ; there is plenty of action and an unexpected dose of humour to keep the proceedings lively . 

nolan's direction is equally effective , never losing its crispness and clarity despite "" memento "" 's challenging gimmick . 

and to top everything off , all the performances rise to the occasion . 

pierce is terrific as the troubled leonard ; moss shows great range as enigmatic natalie ; and pantoliano's teddy achieves a splendidly affable yet sinister quality . 

 "" memento "" may be the year's best screenplay , and is certainly amongst the top theatrical attractions of 2001 . 
"
" "" rebel without a cause "" is such an important film in american history because it is a true analysis of youth in america that everyone of all ages can relate to . 

everyone feels that they are different in some way , that they don't belong in some places and "" rebel without a cause "" successfully shows on screen these universal emotions . 

no matter what generation you belong to , these feelings are present . 

this is why james dean is admired by america , because in this film he represents us all and his actions are actions that we would also execute . 

in our minds , we just try to do the right thing just like dean's jim stark does . 

not only does "" rebel without a cause "" display these universal emotions for all to relate to but it also shows that america has suffered a uniqe pattern in its social structure . 

each generation looks at its past generation without a strong connection . 

this is because times change and in response people change . 

no matter how popular you were once , as your generation grows older , newer breeds look at you in a different light . 

this is why stark and his friends never could form a strong relationship with their parents . 

even if their parents insisted that they were also rebellious and troublesome in the past , the teens could not believe this . 

in one humorous scene , stark , his girlfriend judy ( natalie wood ) , and his pal plato ( sal mineo ) pretend they are adults . 

they use upper class british accents and in their conversations they make it out to appear that kids are no good and should be ignored . 

this scene shows that what was once cool in a past generation is the complete opposite in another . 

speaking on behalf of my generation , i feel that dean has lost a lot of his coolness from our perspective as the years have grown by . 

the only ones who seem to still lionize him are those members of his generation . same 

goes for brando , redford , even deniro . 

i can only imagine how vaguely matt damon , ben affleck , and brad pitt will be viewed at the mid point of the twenty first century . 

will dean even be remembered when these newcomers are forgotten ? 

any film that sparks this kind of thought is certainly a milestone in american film . 

even if "" rebel without a cause "" has some ridiculous scenes ( the game of chicken - did people really act this way ? ) , an unbelievable conclusion ( how did everyone end up at the abandoned mansion at the end ? ) , and a silly romance ( wood declares her love for dean after talking to him for a couple hours ) it still is a fabulous film . 

the acting is so believable that it is no wonder that dean was considered the epitome of cool . 

now , however , the coolness is fading . . . 
"
"in the company of men made a splash at the sundance film festival because , in a year plagued by brothers mcmullen-style , earnestly shallow gen-x angst pictures , it seemed to be actually about something . 

it angered people , started arguments outside the theater , riled things up . 

it ignited a spark of excitement in what otherwise has been a disappointing year for independent film . 

having endured my share of the hype , i waited calmly for men to reach the hinterlands wherein i reside , and then checked in to see what all the fuss was about . 

does men live up to its press ? 

well , yes it does . 

and it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office . 

for the uninitiated , newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard , two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment . 

chad and howard are archetypes , examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business . 

chad is the blond golden boy , genetically engineered for success , the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder . 

howard is chad's boss , but he is weaker of will , the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent . 

we first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge . 

there chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain : he and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office , woo her simultaneously , win her love , and then dump her . 

the reason ? 

both men have recently been dumped themselves , and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex . 

 "" it'll restore a little dignity to our lives , "" he says . 

howard , helpless against the force of chad's will , agrees to the plan . 

they quickly spot their prey in the form of christine ( stacy edwards ) , a fragile deaf woman working as a temp . 

chad moves in for the kill , flashing his golden boy smile , plying christine with lunch , then flowers , then dinner . 

howard follows suit , though his efforts are in contrast ham-handed and desperate . 

flattered to have the attention of two eligible men , christine dates them both . 

you can guess which one she falls for . 

soon a tragic lovers' triangle develops : christine loves chad , chad loves himself , and howard loves christine on the grounds that , since she's handicapped and shy , she just might be wretched and lonely enough to settle for him . 

adult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high , does it ? 

in chad , writer/director labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed to film-hannibal lector may eat human flesh , but chad is an eater of souls . 

his evil is as subtle as a viper's , and as easy as his smile . 

we watch in stunned disbelief as he back-stabs coworkers , humiliates his subordinates , and works his deadly venom into christine's heart . 

his character would be a joke if he wasn't so chillingly real- all of us have worked with a chad , and some of us may be him . 

he's the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness . 

if one of his co-workers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with a bag full of handguns , he had best have his escape route clearly in mind . 

politics is his game , and the modern cubicle-filled office is his playground . 

men wears the guise of a black comedy , but it functions best as allegory . 

the most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company , then forces him to prove it in a manner i won't describe . 

the scene is charged with racism and fraught with peril . 

could it happen in the real world ? 

probably not . 

taken as allegory , however , it is representative of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society . 

maybe it's just the english major in me , but chad , in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard , can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism , of greed without conscience . 

the entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism- only the strong will survive . 

the marvel of labute's multi-layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way . 

but does the film work as entertainment ? 

its darned funny in spots , particularly in the men's room scenes , which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold a conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions . 

it works less well as drama , since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers . 

stacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine , and succeeds in making us care for her , but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her . 

likewise , chad and howard are simply the sum of their actions . 

by the end of the film you'll feel as if you've met a genuine monster in chad ; perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film . 

certainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed . 

but the picture is often mesmerizing , and the script is a work of fine craftsmanship , which makes it well worth your time . 

like all good films , it offers a myriad of parallels to the outside world . 

while watching chad in his moment of triumph , i couldn't help but think that bill gates must have felt the same sort of cold , merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it to steve jobs . 

there may be a little bit of chad in all of us , but some of us have taken chad-ness to the level of art . 
"
"alchemy is steeped in shades of blue . 

kieslowski's blue , that is . 

with its examination of death , isolation , character restoration , and recovery from loss , suzanne myers' new independent film echoes the polish director's internationally-acclaimed 1993 release . 

language aside , the principal difference between the films is that , while kieslowski took great pains to draw us into the main character's world , alchemy keeps its viewers at arm's length . 

as a result , while we're able to appreciate the film's intellectual tapestry , it is emotionally distant . 

alchemy is divided into three chapters : "" charity "" , "" faith "" , and "" hope "" . 

while there are common themes and story elements running through all three , the single constant is the main character , a sculptor/russian translator named louisa ( rya kihlstedt ) . 

when the film opens , she's living with her painter boyfriend , whom she believes to be cheating on her . 

following his sudden death in an automobile accident , louisa's life is thrown into turmoil . 

events swirls around her , and she can't find a source of stability . 

in her quest to make sense out of her loss , she befriends her late boyfriend's mistress , visits her ill sister , and , eventually , abandons her old life by joining a "" back-to- nature "" cult . 

alchemy successfully explores a variety of compelling issues . 

in addition to asking the basic question of how a person should cope with the unexpected death of a loved one , it probes beneath the surface of concepts like the importance of faith in the healing process , the meaning of love , and the nature of art . 

does personality restoration come through interacting with others or escaping from the familiar ? 

are artistic epiphanies the result of focused solitude or of living life , with all of its various distractions , to the fullest ? 

myers' challenge is to make these subjects , art film staples , engrossing in a new context . 

through louisa's struggles , she succeeds . 

while alchemy isn't always emotionally appealing , it never loses its fascination . 

even when we're not connecting with louisa , who is often more of a locus for ideas than a fully-developed personality , there's enough material on-screen to hold our attention . 

the cinematography is stunning . 

city scenes are tinted with blue , adding a cold , bleak dimension to the film's early portions . 

later , when louisa reaches the "" wilderness "" , we're treated to a dazzling array of autumnal splendor -- brightly-colored leaves in the trees and on the ground . 

it's a startling-but-effective visual contrast that emphasizes the changes taking place in louisa's life as she travels the road back to emotional stability . 

the title refers to the practice of a group of mystical faith- healers who use "" alchemy "" to provide for the needs of the body and soul . 

and , although louisa partakes of their peculiar brand of medicine , it's ultimately love and companionship , not alchemy , that brings solace . 

her pain is assuaged only when she lets go of the belief that the inherent safety of being alone is life's ultimate goal . 

even though louisa's final transformation lacks the impact it could have possessed had she been a more vital character , it's still an intriguing and enlightening process to watch . 

alchemy isn't pure magic , but , especially during its best moments , it's close . 
"
"it's amazing how a comedian can have the some of the funniest stand-up around but completely fall flat in the movies . 

take adam sandler . 

on the basis of his first two cds ( "" they're all gonna laugh at you ! "" 

and "" what the hell happened to me ? "" ) , 

he's the best thing to hit comedy since robin williams . 

but when you put him in front of a camera , it just isn't the same . 

i kind of enjoyed happy gilmore and thought that it warranted a marginal recommendation , but his latest film , the waterboy is about as funny as a root canal . 

seriously , i'm willing to wager than there were more laughs in saving private ryan than there are here . 

in fact , i found this movie to be more depressing than comedic . 

the first half hour generated not one smile in me , with it's scenes of emotional abuse towards adam's character of bobby boucher not only by the cruel football players , but also by his very disturbed mother ( kathy bates - what is the world coming to ? ) . 

granted , after the film gets rolling , there are a few mild chuckles throughout ( i'm even willing to admit that it actually had me laughing once or twice ) , but not nearly enough to sustain the waterboy for it's nearly hour and a half running time . 

you're all familiar with the plot because you've seen it at least a million times before ; everyone picks on the hero until he shows a hidden talent and leads the underdog team to victory over the champions , in the process not only winning the respect of his teammates but also getting the woman he loves . 

and believe me , i'm not giving anything away by saying that sandler's team wins . 

if you would actually feel any degree of suspense watching this movie , then god be with you . 

the only things that keep this bomb from getting the big banana are the winning performances from henry winkler as the insecure coach and the severely underrated fairuza balk as bobby's love interest . 

i mean , they should be lending their talents to some loftier purpose , but they do extremely well with what they are given here . 

kudos to both of them . 

my advice to adam is to try and follow in the footsteps of veteran comedians like williams and steve martin , who made a very smooth and successful transition from stage to screen . 

rely more on actual comedy rather than strange voices and rude noises to make people laugh . 

or maybe even show what dramatic talent he might have , like jim carrey did with the recent truman show . 

with the obvious and considerable talent that he possesses , he just can't keep going on like this . 
"
"in our time . 

in our modern world , where the cool rule , it's hard to imagine that shakespeare is becoming 'the man' . 

and yet - film after film , after film , is based on his everlasting magic . 

in warner brothers' latest production , shakespeare is kicking ass to a rap beat , while his magic and intelligence slowly fades away . 

though the producers of the matrix have vaguely based their picture on william shakespeare's 'romeo and juliet' , its title sequence with a frightening rap song and a black limo making its way through the dark streets of new york , is very hard to associate with shakespeare's poetry . 

the film takes place during a silent war between the two major mafia families in the city - the afro americans against the chinese . 

the youngest son of a chinese mafia chieftain is found murdered . 

the afro-americans are immediately suspected , but a peace treaty is signed between the two godfathers . 

it is at this point that han ( the romeo of the story ) finds out about his brother's death . 

escaping from a prison in china , he returns to united states to avenge his brother's fate . 

but before he can restore justice with his kung fu kicks , he falls in love with a mysterious beauty . 

the only problem is that she is the daughter of his enemy . . 

there's only a weak echo of shakespeare's talent in this disappointing production . 

and there are more problems besides its title . 

of course we don't call it a deformation of a great masterpiece . 

we call it 'modernization' . 

it seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond to lyrics , without any car chases and gun fights . 

this lack of respect for the audience i find very disturbing . 

kenneth brannagh has already proven that shakespeare doesn't need to be updated , because his tales are grounded in the basics of life and human nature . 

and as long as love , hate , honesty and corruption do exist , everyone will understand and embrace shakespeare . 

i must admit that i found 'rome must die' very confusing . 

i can forgive andrzej bartkowiak , since it is his first attempt at directing . 

he manages to create an incredible atmosphere and directs with a firm precision . 

unfortunately he completely forgot about character- and story developments . 

his latest picture is therefore visually impressive , but intellectually hollow . 

the love story between han ( jet li ) and trish ( aalyah ) , and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped and simplified . 

jet li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen and aalyah has a magical voice . 

their achievement save this film from being completely braindead , but they are not actors , and therefore can not act . 

they are nothing more than two celebrities put together . 

the other actors , including isaiah washington , russell wong , henry o and dmx all give the standard mediocre performances . 

delroy lindo is the only one that projects a coherent image of reality . 

but there's more than acting to worry about . 

even with li's incredible skills in martial arts , the action scenes ( though technically excellent ) are too long and story updates simply embarrassing . 

to make a long story short : 'romeo must die' is not intelligent enough to be a thriller , not sensual enough to be a love story and too serious to be a fun action film . 

it is certain that bartkowiak would be much better off with o this embarrassing and completely unnecessary parallel to 'romeo and juliet' , so the film is completely stuck - not sure of what to be . 

and in the end it's nothing . 

there are no performances worthy of notice , no interesting character- or story surprises . 

so again , the only good thing about it is its technical achievement . 

this film can boast of great sound , fast paced editing , solid cinematography and some very well coordinated action sequences . 

the music is another factor that prevents you from leaving the theatre . 

it is mostly provided by aalyah's enchanting voice and several carefully inserted rap songs by various artists , that create a kind of 'ghetto feel' to it . 

but when i think back , it's not much i remember from this 'production' . 

as in almost every summer movie , there are some interesting scenes , but most of the moments that i remember are associated with massive special effects . 

it is not a film that will get any attention for its artistic qualities , simply because it doesn't have any . 

for someone who has never read shakespeare , it's another popcorn film . 

for those of us who has , it's a waste of money , time and brain cells .

"mr . bean , a bumbling security guard from england is sent to la to help with the grandiose homecoming of a masterpiece american painting . 

the first two words should have said enough to let you know what occurs during bean's trip to la , but if they didn't look out because you are in for a rather interesting if not odd ride . 

heck depending on your humor you might end up laughing through the whole flick . 

either way look out america bean is coming . 

well , what can really be said about this movie , there is very little discernible plot . 

that much is not hard to grapple with for it is a slapstick comedy . 

it achieves that goal rather admirably , but because it is that , the plot is just screaming for help . 

the whole premise that the movie is based on is to say the least flawed . 

the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through and in many causes ad-libbed as you went . 

don't go into this movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece . 

but if this form of humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie , even if you don't like slapstick style humor you will end up laughing because something's are just so stupid . 

the movie goes out and accomplishes what it aims , or so it seems . 

now when you look at the acting in this movie you have to think about two things , first was there any real acting and how hard is it to act in the slapstick manner . 

well , there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasn't the easiest i am sure . 

i have to concede that mr . atkinson's acting in this movie is well done . 

although the role isn't too demanding the slapstick is . 

i think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue , it would have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie . 

now the rest of the actors in the movie , bad acting and poor casting . 

i think that the role opposite bean could have been better , just seemed wrong for the movie . 

a different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that wasn't what was trying to be achieved . 

one thing that i must say , simply to get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results . 

tv shows should do just that stay on tv , it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers . 

i can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively , the best known of those would have to be star trek . 

bean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved . 

now another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly . 

the form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people , these people will think like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless . 

but if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie . 

but to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie . 

there are many movies that are truly worth seeing unlike this one .

"the calendar year has not even reached its midway point , but that hasn't prevented columbia pictures from trotting out a lavish period drama more befitting of the winter oscar-bait season . 

bille august's high-profile adaptation of victor hugo's classic les miserables delivers everything one would expect from a classy hollywood epic--handsome production values , strong performances by a top-notch cast , a literate screenplay--with one critically missing element : emotional sweep . 

for those not familiar with hugo's original novel or the hit stage musical it inspired , the hook of les miserables essentially boils down to something like a 19th-century french-set version of the fugitive . 

after serving 19 years in a prison work camp for stealing a loaf of bread , the brutish jean valjean ( liam neeson ) is paroled . 

immediately upon release , he steals valuable silverware from a kindly bishop who takes him in for a night ; he is caught by authorities , only to be forgiven by the bishop , who lets valjean keep the silver to start a new life on the straight and narrow . 

that he does , and in doing so breaks his parole , which sets the obsessively determined inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) , who was one of the guards in valjean's prison camp , on his trail . 

thematically , however , les miserables is a story about redemption , which valjean finds through his dealings with two women , the hard-luck factory-worker-turned-prostitute fantine ( uma thurman ) , and her illegitimate daughter , cosette . 

years after breaking parole , valjean becomes mayor of the town of vigau , where he forms a warm friendship with fantine after saving her from an unjust arrest by javert . 

valjean promises the gravely ill fantine he will rescue the young cosette ( mimi newman ) from her cruel caretakers , the thenardiers , and raise the child as his own . 

the "" father "" and "" daughter "" eventually land in paris , where the teenage cosette ( claire danes ) falls for dashing student revolutionary marius ( hans matheson ) . 

the decades-spanning story is the stuff that cinematic epics are made of , and the danish august turns in his most accomplished english-language work , following the underrated 1994 superstar soap the house of the spirits and last year's stylish but highly preposterous mystery smilla's sense of snow . 

he and screenwriter rafael yglesias bring the sprawling tale into clear focus and keep the events moving at a brisk pace . 

production designer anna asp , costume designer gabriella pescucci , and cinematographer jorgen persson give les miserables a sumptuous period look whose accomplishment is mostly matched by the efforts of the cast . 

neeson is commanding yet endearingly vulnerable ; rush's finely modulated menace is far more rewarding than his overrated , oscar-winning theatrics in shine ; and thurman disappears nicely into her highly unglamorous role . 

the younger members of the cast fare less well . 

danes is convincing as cosette , but her overdone lip quivering during her crying scenes becomes a distraction ; and matheson , while competent , is a less interesting robert sean leonard . 

as technically adept and cerebrally engaging the film is , by the time les miserables was over , my emotions had only been superficially involved . 

while i was touched by valjean's relationships with fantine and cosette , i was not moved . 

not even reaching the "" touching "" level is the cosette-marius pairing . 

my only previous experience with les miserables is with the musical ( as i am sure many others' is ) , and i was dismayed to see eponine , a friend of marius's who selflessly dies in the name of her unspoken love for him , almost completely jettisoned from this adaptation ( the daughter of the thenardiers , here she is only briefly seen as a child ) . 

her presence would have added some much-needed conflict and emotional heft to the youthful romance , but i suppose august and yglesias felt one tragic heroine ( fantine ) was enough . 

even so , as 1998 creeps into summer blockbuster season , les miserables is a thoughtful , well-made , entertaining film , one that will sate moviegoers hungry for a dose of drama before popcorn no-brainers invade the multiplex .

"a few months before the release of star wars episode 1 , the phantom menace , 20th century fox decides to release another space film , that is a complete rip off of star wars . 

what is the point of this ? 

i do not know , but i wish it hadn't been done , considering wing commander is definitely the year's worst film so far . 

to attract people to this horrible movie , they attached the full trailer for the phantom menace . 

wing commander will draw large crowds , because this is the only film where you can find the phantom menace full trailer attached at this time . 

the trailer for the phantom menace was certainly the best part of the movie experience i had tonight . 

many people do not know that wing commander is based on a star wars computer game . 

i found this very interesting , considering this fact almost says that wing commander is a star wars movie . 

it is nowhere near the level of the star wars films though . 

freddie prinze jr . stars in the film as christopher blair . 

wing commander was a huge mistake for freddie . 

this was definitely his worst performance to date . 

after january's she's all that , i actually saw a good actor in freddie , but now all those visions have been crushed . 

 ( for now anyway . ) 

christopher blair is a pilot who is a part of the battle to stop the kilrathi , a group that is trying to destroy the earth . 

blair's parents also fought in the space battles , and also died there . 

his parents were pilgrims , so many people disrespect him because of this . 

blair is under the command of "" angel "" , played by saffron burrows , and he is friends with another pilot , todd "" maniac marshall "" , played by matthew lillard . 

matthew lillard seems to play the same role in every movie , and he does in this one too . 

his character as stu in 1996's scream ( a+ ) , was a great one , but now , it seems like that same role is being played again , only in a space movie . 

the three are just a small part of a large group trying to stop the kilrathi before they take over earth . 

this plot is very flimsy , and doesn't give a whole lot to work with at all . 

this explains why wing commander drags on , seeming like there is no point to any of the events that are going on . 

the acting is horrible in wing commander . 

many lines seem out of place , and are completely meaningless . 

the acting and dialogue was so terrible , i even found myself laughing at it . 

the other things which are very bad about wing commander are the special effects and the music . 

the special effects are very unrealistic . 

when looking at two ships flying side by side , it is simple to tell they are hanging and a blue screen is behind them . 

the explosions look very unrealistic as well . 

a ship will be blown up , but there will only be fire present four about one half of a second . 

this is very unrealistic . 

music pretty much accompanies the film the entire time . 

the music also felt like video game music , and it was very corny and annoying sounding . 

after we are given the plot , the film repeats itself for another hour , without any plot twists , interesting scenes , or anything important to the film . 

blair is forced to make jumps over other planets , and he must also fight against the kilrathi aircraft . 

for the entire length of the movie , it takes place in space . 

it is truly like you are in a video game , because you are just watching people shoot at each other in ships for a long , extended period of time . 

it's not much fun to watch at all . 

if i wanted to watch people shoot at each other in ships , i would go watch star wars at home . 

at least star wars pays attention to people , myth , feelings , and has some real plot to it . 

the bottom line- bring on the phantom menace 20th century fox !

"with the abundance of trite , recycled movies in the late '90s , there is a tremendous demand by movie lovers ( never mind movie critics ) for movies that present the wide film audience with something truly original : perhaps audaciously , perhaps purely thematically . 

for the former , you need look no further than director tom tykwer's incredible german thriller run lola run , a movie that may make some viewers need a cooling off period afterwards . 

lola , a contemporary goth-girl with blazing red hair receives a desperate phone call from her boyfriend manni one day . 

it seems that because she was late delivering something he lost a bag containing a hundred thousand marks , and if he doesn't deliver a hundred thousand marks within the next twenty minutes , he will be killed . 

this gives lola twenty minutes to come up with 100 , 000 marks , or her boyfriend dies . 

so she runs -- not just jogs , sprints -- in hopes that somehow , someway , she'll be able to obtain the money and save a life . 

>from there , as critic steve rhodes described it , run lola run plays a bit like "" sliding doors on steroids . 

with a non-stop techno soundtrack , wierd camerawork , all kinds of insane zooms and a truly breakneck pace , anyone that is bored with run lola run has to be smoking something . 

indeed , the movie is often outrageously exciting , as well as bitterly ironic and subtly serious . 

very much like titanic , run lola run is an achievement with filmmaking much more than it is an achievement in film . 

the way the movie is made , for pure visual style , tykwer's movie is breathtaking ( literally , sometimes ) . 

thematically it does leave something to be desired ; it toys around with some intriguing ideas but does occasionally seem as if there is little substance behind all of the flash . 

while you are watching , this will not matter . 

running a breezy 81 minutes , this is one movie i wished was longer because it was so damn good while it lasted . 

it is the equivalent of a roller-coaster in the amount of thrills and fun that it offers .

"the farrelly brothers' third film , after dumb and dumber ( 7 . 5/10 ) and kingpin ( 8/10 ) , brings together the real-life couple of cameron diaz and matt dillon , some nasty humour , a cute dog , and a mix of love , fate and romance . 

plot : high-school nerd ted gets lucky when the cutest girl in his class asks him to the prom . 

unfortunately for ted , he accidentally gets a part of his male anatomy ( ouch ! ) 

caught in his zipper , and misses the big night . 

thirteen years later , ted still can't get mary out of his mind , and hires a private detective ( dillon ) to find her . 

once found , it turns out that mary has more than one suitor , and that's when the real fun begins . 

critique : likeable comedy with a few extremely funny scenes , some funny looking people , and a plot that won't ever put you to sleep . 

having said that , i must admit that i did like the farrellys' two previous films more than this one , but that is saying a lot , since i really did love those earlier pics . 

this one is also quite funny , but it didn't really blow me away like the others . 

then again , maybe my expectations were too high . 

then again , maybe i should shut up , and write a little more about the film , and less about my supposed subconscious reasons for liking/disliking the film . 

continuing where their other pictures left off , the farrellys' create a cutesy world of people with strange and endearing qualities , and a simple plot by which to tie them all together . 

this one also includes plenty of toilet humour , but also some borderline fun-making of the disabled and mentally-challenged . 

i must admit that i really wasn't sure whether to laugh at some points or not . 

not a good place to be . 

having said that , the scenes that did tear through the audience , and yours truly , were extremely hilarious , and went on for several minutes after the punchline . 

the laughter practically killed out the next scene for one of the best ones in the movie ( something to do with hair gel ) . 

on the negative end , i did not like the musical interludes of jonathan richman that ran through the entire picture . 

i found them quite useless , unfunny and distracting . 

also , i found that a lot of the funnier scenes had already been shown in the film's trailer . 

and of course , i never quite buy the fact that these beautiful , intelligent , single women still can't seem to find the "" right guy "" ( see kiss the girls ( 7/10 ) . 

i did really like all of the actors in the film , especially ben stiller , who appears to be solidifying his mark as a great comical actor with this picture and one of my favourites from 1996 , flirting with disaster ( 8/10 ) . 

i also liked matt dillon with his big teeth , and lee evans with his superb faux-sympathy british accent . 

funny stuff . 

also , make sure that you stay for the credits , because there is an entire montage of outtakes from the film that plays under a lip-synched version of "" build me up buttercup "" , which is really cool . 

overall , a cute comedy with a decent premise , and a few particularly hilarious scenes . 

little known facts : the farrellys big break came when they somehow got a copy of their script "" dust to dust "" into the hands of eddie murphy via ? murphy's neighbour . 

they only found out about murphy's interest , when they saw eddie mention the script on the david letterman show one night . 

matt dillon is a high school dropout . 

in between acting gigs , dillon has branched out into the restaurant business . 

close to home in his native new york , he co-owns both a bar called the whiskey and a swanky uptown eatery called the falls . 

cameron diaz stands 5 "" 9 , started working as a model at the early age of 16 , and loves cats . 

ben stiller's father is jerry stiller . 

he played george costanza's ( jason alexander ) father on tv's "" seinfeld "" . 

peter farrelly has written a novel entitled "" outside providence "" which is currently being filmed starring alec baldwin . 

rob moran , who plays the cop in this film , also played the millionaire bowler in kingpin , and the bartender in dumb and dumber . 

he is old friends with the farrelly brothers from college , and is currently married to entertainment tonight anchor/correspondant julie moran . 

harland williams , who plays the nutty hitchhiker in this film , also played a state trooper in the farrelly's earlier dumb and dumber , and was the star of the unfortunate rocket man .

"this has been an extraordinary year for australian films . 

 "" shine "" has just scooped the pool at the australian film institute awards , picking up best film , best actor , best director etc . to that we can add the gritty "" life "" ( the anguish , courage and friendship of a group of male prisoners in the hiv-positive section of a jail ) and "" love and other catastrophes "" ( a low budget gem about straight and gay love on and near a university campus ) . 

i can't recall a year in which such a rich and varied celluloid library was unleashed from australia . 

 "" shine "" was one bookend . 

stand by for the other one : "" dead heart "" . 

>from the opening credits the theme of division is established . 

the cast credits have clear and distinct lines separating their first and last names . 

bryan | brown . 

in a desert settlement , hundreds of kilometres from the nearest town , there is an uneasy calm between the local aboriginals and the handful of white settlers who live nearby . 

the local police officer has the task of enforcing "" white man's justice "" to the aboriginals . 

these are people with a proud 40 , 000 year heritage behind them . 

naturally , this includes their own system of justice ; key to which is "" payback "" . 

an eye for an eye . 

revenge . 

usually extracted by the spearing through of the recipient's thigh . 

brown , as the officer , manages quite well to keep the balance . 

he admits that he has to 'bend the rules' a bit , including actively encouraging at least one brutal "" payback "" . 

 ( be warned that this scene , near the start , is not for the squeamish ) . 

the local priest - an aboriginal , but in the "" white fellas "" church - has a foot on either side of the line . 

he is , figuratively and literally , in both camps . 

ernie dingo brings a great deal of understanding to this role as the man in the middle . 

he is part churchman and part politician . 

however the tension , like the heat , flies and dust , is always there . 

whilst her husband - the local teacher - is in church , white lady kate ( milliken ) and her aborginal friend tony , ( pedersen ) have gone off into the hills . 

he takes her to a sacred site , even today strictly men-only . 

she appears to not know this . 

tony tells her that this is a special place , an initiation place . 

he then makes love to her , surrounded by ancient rock art . 

the community finds out about this sacrilegious act and it's payback time . 

the fuse is lit and the brittle inter-racial peace is shattered . 

everyone is affected in the fall out . 

to say more is to give away the details of this finely crafted film . 

suffice to say it's a rewarding experience . 

bryan brown , acting and co-producing , is the pivotal character . 

his officer is real , human and therefore flawed . 

brown comments that he expects audiences to feel warmth towards the man , then suddenly feel angry about him . 

it wasn't long ago that i visited central australia - ayers rock ( uluru ) and alice springs - for the first time . 

the wide-screen cinematography shows the dead heart of australia in a way that captures it's vicious beauty , but never deteriorates into a moving slide show , in which the gorgeous background dominates those pesky actors in the foreground . 

the cultural clash has provided the thesis for many a film ; from the western to the birdcage . 

at least three excellent australian films have covered the aboriginal people and the line between them and we anglo-saxon 'invaders' : "" jedda "" , "" the chant of jimmie blacksmith "" and "" the last wave "" . 

in a year when the race 'debate' has reared up in australia , it is nourishing to see such an intelligent , non-judgemental film as "" dead heart "" . 

the aboriginal priest best sums this up . 

he is asked to say if he is a "" black fella or white fella "" . 
"
"barb wire , pamela anderson lee's first foray into films , highlights the fact that her only talent lies in her silicone enhanced assets . 

being the only notable member of the cast , the camera lingers lustily o n her body at every opportunity , making her character's catch line , "" don't call me babe , "" sound very ironic indeed . 

from the very opening of the movie , we are treated to a striptease routine from anderson , ending in her hurling her stiletto smack between the eyes of a lusty male who happened to call her babe . 

throughout the movie , there is ample footage of enormous breasts and cleavage , if not of anderson's , then at least of the female extras . 

this alone is enough to retitle the movie babe wire . 

for a plot , barb wire rehashes the casablanca storyline . 

it is 2017 , the middle of the second american civil war , and barb wire , a former resistance fighter , runs a joint in steel harbour called hammerhead ( ! ! ) . 

known for attracting resistance fighters an d characters of all sorts , the bar attracts the attention of the government forces who appear dressed in nazi-style uniforms . 

in between bashing up helpless males and showing off her trademark breasts , barb wire has to help a former lover and his wife get to the airport on the other side of the town , past the government-controlled areas , and to freedom . 

even the airport looks like the one in casablanca , except that the plane in the background is a modern , private jet . 

there are hardly any significant moments in this film , and one gets the impression that it was designed for young teenagers familiar with the dark horse comics version of "" barb wire . "" 

if anything , one leaves the film with the confirmation that anderson di d not do her own stunts . 

who could fight and jump in a skimpy , strapless leather top , and yet keep her breasts from spilling out ? 

only a stuntwoman . 

not pamela anderson lee .

"when jim henson passed away , he left behind diverse legions of fans and a company whose ultimate success , it now seems , hinged on his input . 

jim henson productions and the creature shop are still thriving financially , but as the last two muppet films ( or that silly computer-generated monkey from lost in space ) demonstrate , the thrill and genius are gone . 

i'm not sure the dark crystal , made today , would generate from an audience of kids five to fifty the same awe-filled response . 

an all-powerful crystal has cracked , causing the leaders of the green world to split apart into two beings : the big , gentle mystics , and the vulture-like skeksis . 

the mystics send jen , a naive gelfling boy , on a mission to find the shard that cracked away , which must be reinserted into the crystal before the skeksis become eternal rulers , before the great "" conjunction "" of three suns . 

along the way , jen encounters and teams up with the only other gelfling alive , the rebecca demornay-like kira , an ogre-witch named aughra , who removes her eyes to look at things , and a spastic-but-friendly , tumbleweed-like animal named fizzgig . 

much of the beauty in the dark crystal , which is a simple tale ( though it does not condescend to any viewer ) , lies in its art direction and creature design . 

the puppeteering is phenomenal--observe the scenes in which jen plays his flute , or the landwalker chase--but i must stress that any thoughts of strings and hands and remote controls all but vanish in the opening moments of the picture , a delicately-narrated ( by john baddeley ) , absorbing prologue . 

the voice work in the film , by muppet regulars and irregulars , is tone-perfect . 

as well , trevor jones' score should not be discounted : it contributes to the film almost as an unseen character . 

i suppose , due to the complexity involved in executing a movie of this nature , that it couldn't be helped , but i wish the film was longer . 

jen and kira have wonderful . . . well , 

chemistry , and more scenes of them quietly conversing would have been appreciated . 

the dark crystal has a very small cult following . 

the weaker labyrinth is probably better-known , which is upsetting . 

a friend of mine related a story to me that henson was pressured into planting humans among labyrinth's creatures due to the financial failure of people-less the dark crystal . 

that film never quite found its footing ; it played like an acid-trip episode of "" the muppet show "" with david bowie as guest-host , borrowing from tolkien and pandering to tolkien's fan-base . 

 ( i suppose i just made labyrinth sound appetizing to a certain sector of the public . ) 

the dark crystal deserved ( and still deserves ) a bigger audience . 

it's the best kind of children's entertainment : elegant , fantastical , and courageously un-hip . 

brian henson , fortunate son , keep looking back at this , your father's masterpiece . 
"
"i am a steven seagal fan . 

i only say this now because "" mufti splenetik "" isn't my real name and because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great things . 

any proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on . 

seagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue , heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones ( which we'll always hear when seagal does his limb-twisting thing ) , rarely a female co-lead in sight ( unless it's a real-life model-wife who hasn't worked since weird science ) and , usually the worst possible titles you can imagine . 

not to mention very straightforward plots , generally all-round bad dialogue and mr implacable leather-face himself in that same black outfit he's been in since nico doing his "" my hands are sharp , nimble knives "" thing , seagal the stoic , sir petrified ponytail , duke of dull . 

in the glimmer man , seagal breaks out of this formula : he gets a * sidekick * , attempts to banter , and puts on a new vest . 

he's also put on quite a lot of weight . 

small potatoes , you may say , a man should be able to accessorize and banter if he wants to , but damnit , if it ain't broke , why fix it ? 

 ( more on this disappointed person's dashed expectations later ) . 

as jack cole , seagal is a homicide detective with a questionable past . 

while he and his partner ( played by keenen ivory wayans ) are investigating a series of ritual killings , cole himself becomes a suspect , especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole . 

it turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin ( you just can't trust these homicide detectives ) , someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them , and hence , well , you know , that "" glimmer man "" thing . 

an increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger , more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman ( bob gunton ) , cole's former cia boss ( brian cox ) and deals involving chemical weapons . 

the glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff , drawing ( as with his other films ) elements from the hotter films of the year ( eg , se7en ) . 

it's the other changes that disappoint . 

for example , although there's a fair amount of violence in this movie , there's also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans , probably the best known of the wayans tribe ( how many are there , exactly ? ) from television's "" in living colour . "" 

wayans plays whiney straightman to seagal's bead-adorned and brocade-draped cole , keeping up his "" are you crazy "" part of the dialogue with wasted zest . 

as campbell , wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partner's eccentric habits , but the chemistry between the two is minimal , and seagal's wooden comebacks make for painful watching . 

a cook in under seige 2 , seagal is now a buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble . 

he chants , refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies . 

again , a benign ( if trite ) plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak more than usual . 

heck , he has to deliver punchlines and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large part of the film . 

is that a lot to ask of the seague ? 

too much . 

seagal's best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies : to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages , and to do it silently , and alone . 

not for seagal , the snappy one-liners of arnold and stallone , nor the attempts to show that he can act , much less think . 

no kindergarten cop , no oscar , just simple , unadulterated deathblows . 

that's really how it must have started : like-minded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch the seague do his thing , knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else . 

we trusted him . 

we got to know him . 

now , betrayal . 

i don't know if i can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that he's going to try to be funny again . 

i'll try , but it won't be easy . 

if you haven't watched the glimmer man yet , you might want to wait for the video to come out . 

it's easier to just fast forward the dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences . 

after all , if we can't depend on our fantasies , what can we depend on ? 

the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . 

 * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! 

 * * * pretty good , bring a friend . 

 * * * * amazing , potent stuff . 

 * * * * * perfection . 

see it twice . 

mufti spelenetik is still a steven seagal fan . 

everybody makes mistakes once in awhile .

"america loves convenience . 

after all , we're the culture that invented the cell phone , the 24-hour atm , and my most beloved , the remote control . 

yet perhaps this time , with ghosts of mars , we have taken our love of convenience to far . 

ghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as a tough as nails , pill-poppin' , martian cop , sent with her squadron to retrieve "" demolition "" williams ( ice cube ) from a remote mining town for trial back home . 

when she and her comrades , appropriately dubbed "" the commander , "" "" the rookies , "" and the guy with the cool accent discover the town's residents slaughtered , they are forced to team up with williams to escape from the remaining residents' head-chopping , alien-possessed clutches . 

filled with a lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks , flashes-sideways , and viewpoint changes , ghosts of mars is a hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill-conceived action sequences . 

the only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story . 

ripped straight from the pages of a 1970s zombie movie , ghosts leaps from one convenient moment to the next , stopping only to kill the characters which are most convenient to lose . 

attempts at character interaction and development are rare and forced . 

most of these moments come off as kwik-e-mart wisdom , dispensed heartily around the slushee machine of life by the even-tempered streetwise hand of ice cube . 

with a gun in one hand and a dynamite cap in the other , cube reminisces about his street life , comparing the zombie-stomping fun to "" me and my brother when we was kids . "" 

apparently , crime in the bronx has gotten so bad that the residents have actually taken to ritually decapitating one another for entertainment . 

but , even in the film's darkest moments , fate conveniently lends a hand , supplying heavily armored transportation and easily accessible rifles and dynamite . 

yes , in the future , man may travel to space and conquer mars , but nothing beats a good stick of tnt . 

and as we all know , every police station , past , present , or future , keeps a healthy supply on hand . 

characters die , heads are lopped off , but they were only supporting roles anyway , so why should we care ? 

as long as you have plenty of narcotics , immunity is guaranteed . 

eventually though , even the most well-trained zombie alien gets a bit uppity and needs to be taught a lesson . 

what better way than by sacrificing a few minor characters to a convenient nuclear detonation , killing anything the machine guns can't handle . 

explosions are fun . 

and even if the nukes don't get them , the conveniently placed dynamite packs on the train stolen from the set of the road warrior certainly will . 

in the end this film defines itself when our cop's tribunal pronounces , "" is that all you have to tell us ? "" 

for , indeed , john carpenter has run out of things to say , and has instead decided to use whatever is convenient to tell a ridiculously bad story .

"anna and the king strides onto the screen in full regalia , wearing a brilliant suit of sumptuous landscapes , deep , vibrant colors and an epic storyline . 

it's true beauty comes from it's subtle ruminations on the politics of power , whether it's between governments , or the interplay between a man and a woman . 

anna ( jodie foster ) is a widowed british schoolteacher with a touch of wanderlust trying to grasp her quicksilver feelings concerning the recent death of her husband . 

with son in tow , she takes the employ of king mongkut ( chow yun-fat ) to tutor his son in the english language . 

mongkut sees the strength of the british and correctly surmises that his country's future lies in opening itself up to the ways of the western world . 

anna function is to help provide that link . 

the core of the film , of course , deals with the blossoming love between anna and mongkut as it attempts to germinate in the unfriendly soil of a shifting political climate . 

foster plays anna with equal parts clenched jaw and wide-eyed wonder . 

she is assertive , yet , respectful of the king as she initially tries to impose her western sensibilities upon him . 

it is one of foster's strongest performances since silence of the lambs in a role she could not have played earlier in her career . 

she brings a mature self- awareness and determination that might not have come across from a younger foster . 

it's a joy to watch her cagily bargain for her own measure of influence within the realm of mongkut's monarchy . 

when she makes her entrance into a politically charged banquet mid-film , she exudes a hypnotic beauty that is deepened by her textured performance . 

chow-yun fat's king mongkut is every measure of foster's anna , perhaps even more so . 

this is the chow yun-fat that hong kong cinema has been in love with for nearly twenty years . 

he is imposing , yet vulnerable , playful , but stern . 

it is an impressively assured and nuanced performance . 

precious time is stolen from the movie's 155 minutes running time by an unengaging subplot involving one the king's concubines ( bai ling ) and her love of a commoner . 

it strikes with the subtlety of siam's fabled white elephant as it stomps through the leisurely paced story . 

some may be put off by the action filled climax of the movie . 

although a bit inconsistent in tone from the rest of the film , it fits within the established subplot of a perceived siege by neighboring burma , a country backed by the british . 

anna and the king transcends being a predictable , traditional love story by avoiding mawkishness . 

it shows a seduction of intelligence . 

ever mindful of each other's positions , anna and king mongkut negotiate a maze of social customs , conflicting world views and lost loved ones to connect on a level that ultimately proves deeply satisfying , if not achingly bittersweet .

"at first glance , three kings looks to be just another war movie , the 90s version of all those favourite war movies with names i cannot remember . 

the 90s version , it definitely is , just another war movie ? 

not in your dreams ! 

imagine pulp fiction approach to saving private ryan , thats three kings for you . 

believe it or not , it bears the cool of the former and the stark humane meaning of the latter . 

the story brings us to the twilight of the gulf war , with the allied troops victorious . 

majpr archie gates ( clooney ) leads an enterprising bunch of grunts to a rather unorthodox post-war looting spree ; the millions in gold bars secretly stowed away by saddam in a desolate village in the desert . 

as the rest of the troops are celebrating their victory and getting ready to be shipped home , this `wild bunch goes awol on an armed hum-vee ( the vehicle of choice of the us army ) . 

they soon find out that they have much resistance , as they get tangled with the local rebellion against saddams forces . 

frequently switching their modes between looters and robin hoods merry men , they become consciously attacked by their own morals . 

as the film begins to roll , it seemed to have a rather `light mood to it . 

`special effects such as when gates describes to his men how a bullet can kill simply paves the way for a light-hearted funny action movie . 

three kings is much smarter than that . 

as the conflict becomes more and more complex , the audience will be trapped in a limbo , trying to stay focussed on that light-mood/serious-mood that the film seem to portray . 

i personally found this analogous to the same feelings of the main characters involved in the film ; trapped between their initial plan paved by greed and their own sense of humanity . 

this simply made the entire experience of watching three kings truly brilliant . 

action sequences are not shot as your old-fashioned war films nor anything like steven spielbergs in-your-face war violence . 

they are carefully built to generate tension with just the right tight close-ups and pauses , right before the action starts . 

not john woo for sure but more of sergio leones spaghetti western style ( tons of them starring clint eastwood ) . 

great performances by clooney and wahlberg but the brilliance have to lie in the conception of this film ; the screenwriter and the director . 

three kings ranks among the best films of the year , well , for me at least . 

highly recommended .

"it's wednesday , march 27 , and a murder investigation is underway in charlotte , south carolina . 

the crime : a young prostitute , elizabeth ( renee zellweger ) , has been brutally slain . 

one half of her severed body was found in a bag at the train station . 

the other half was discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority , miles away . 

the police duo of braxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are strapped for leads . 

at the moment , they have only one possible suspect : wayland ( tim roth ) , a wealthy , unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude from princeton and appears to be the least likely character to commit such a heinous act . 

that's the premise for deceiver , a new thriller from the pate brothers , jonas and josh , who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave . 

deceiver plays out like a mind game between the intellectually superior wayland and the two not- so-bright cops ( captions early in the proceedings let us know that wayland's iq is 151 ; by contrast , kennesaw's is 122 and braxton's is 102 ) . 

the setting is a police interrogation room where a lie detector test is about to be administered . 

over three days , as wayland returns to answer more questions , the drama and tension among these three characters gradually escalates until , inevitably , it boils over . 

other plot elements are thrown in for good measure . 

wayland suffers from a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can , in stressful situations , render him virtually catatonic or extremely violent . 

braxton , a compulsive gambler , is deep in debt to a local syndicate . 

and kennesaw is haunted by a dark , abusive side that delights in terrorizing women , especially his wife ( rosanna arquette ) , whom he suspects of being unfaithful . 

the foibles and failings of these three are brought into the open as the mystery around elizabeth's death deepens and it becomes unclear who has the upper hand : the suspect or his questioners . 

deceiver , which mostly transpires in a dimly-lit room and involves a lot of smart dialogue , has the feel of a david mamet play : edgy , claustrophobic , and tense . 

the atmosphere is explosive , and some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting . 

deceiver has the power to grab an audience . 

unfortunately , in the end , it succumbs to the need to throw in one last , unexpected twist , and this is its undoing . 

for , while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers , it also stretches our credulity too much , and raises more questions than it answers . 

it's only an effective wrap-up if you don't think too carefully about its full implications . 

of course , the film as a whole plays fast and loose with reality and logic . 

police procedure is totally ignored and it's almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation would or could proceed in this manner . 

but the real focus in deceiver is on character interaction , not plot details . 

deceiver only occasionally gets out of the police station , and those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the prostitute . 

the pates employ a number of interesting techniques to present vignettes from elizabeth's final days and hours . 

the most intriguing of these is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice-over by visually showing what really happened . 

moments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks . 

the movie , obviously fashioned in the manner of classic film noir , drips atmosphere . 

there are some fascinating stylistic touches ; for example , although the setting is contemporary , all of the telephones are old-fashioned , rotary models . 

cinematographer bill butler is given an opportunity to use unconventional camera work to liven up deceiver's look . 

some of the things he tries ( mostly those that involve the contrast between light and shadow ) work exceptionally well , while others ( like any of several lazy susan shots ) seem more like unnecessary visual tricks . 

as wayland , tim roth gives the film's top performance , despite occasionally treading the tightrope between acting and overacting . 

roth makes us believe that wayland is both as brilliant and as troubled as he's supposed to be . 

the other two leads , chris penn and michael rooker , aren't as effective . 

both play their characters like familiar types . 

penn's performance is uninspired ; rooker's lacks subtlety . 

some of the best work is turned in by the supporting actors . 

renee zellweger , in a role that's miles away from her star-making turn in jerry maguire , brings a note of vulnerability and humanity to a part that could easily have become a caricature . 

rosanna arquette is solid as kennesaw's wife , and michael parks delivers several wonderful scenes as a psychiatrist who's entrusted with evaluating wayland's condition . 

one of the best things about deceiver is that it never talks down to the audience . 

plot points aren't hammered home , and , although the ending has its weaknesses , everything isn't spelled out in bold letters . 

the pates give audience members credit for having brains , which is an increasingly rare characteristic for film makers . 

occasionally gripping and never uninteresting , deceiver is a fine noir effort .

"corey yuen's latest film , "" hero "" is notable on two fronts . 

first this is the film to bring back the shaw brothers studio back to the forefront of film production . 

secondly , the film is the re-discovery of yuen biao . 

the film opens around the end of the qin dynasty , when many immigrants were making their way to shanghai . 

poverty and crime rule most of china . 

a young man , ma wing jing and his brother enter the fabled city and become laborers at the pier . 

tam see is the most powerful gangster in town , having control of the center of the city and having an alliance with the british army . 

wing jing and see become friends during a confrontation . 

their friendship grows as both men start to realize their dreams , wing jing's to be a powerful and wealthy man , and see to settle down with a woman he can truly love . 

wing jing meets the singer at the club ( jessica hester ) and falls in love with her , not realizing that she is the star attraction . 

after stealing her picture from a display , wing jing and his brother plot to impress her . 

first they rob two foreigner's of their money and cloths , and set up a midnight rendezvous . 

unfortunately , wing jing has run afoul of a rival gangster , yeung seung who has bribed the police in an effort to gain control of see's night club . 

the two bothers are arrested and held until they manage to escape just before dawn . 

jessica , having waited outside in the cold with her manager all night , gives up and returns home . 

see decides to retire , he gives the night club to wing jing , as repayment for saving his life during an attempted murder . 

see arranges the trade and ask his lover ( valerie chow ) to take care of wing jing . 

unfortunately , she has sided with yeung seung . 

the performances in the film are all top notch , with fine turns by takeshi kaneshiro as ma wing jing and jessica hester and valerie chow . 

the comic turn by yuen wah , previously known as the mad vietnamese in samo hung's "" eastern condors "" , is a marvelous surprise . 

his gift for comedy is marvelously understated and hilarious . 

the stand-out is by yuen biao who returns to the screen after a string of disappointments , with a stellar performance . 

his tam see is a triad boss who knows that his time is coming to an end but still has the cunning and craft to uphold his pride . 

his gangster is almost non-violent , in that he only retaliates , never instigates violence . 

but when the time comes to fight , yuen biao has never looked better . 

corey yuen directs the film with a maturity and a sense of pacing that has been lacking in hong kong movies as of late . 

the lighting , cinematography and staging of the film are beautiful to watch . 

the action scenes do not disappoint either . 

this is the most aggressive and inventive martial art choreography i've seen in some time , actually surpassing jackie chan's work in both 'rumble in the bronx' and 'first strike' . 

the special effects team deserves praise for a fantastic job of making the impossible look possible . 

an early fight between takeshi kaneshiro and yuen biao on the back of a horse is to be seen to be believed . 

also noteworthy is the score for the film , done in a marvelously lush orchestral style , not representative of most hong kong fare . 

i would dare to say it ranks as high as the scores for both "" titanic "" and "" rosewood "" as best of the year . 

all in all , "" hero "" marks a grand return to filmmaking for shaw brothers . 

this is the film that gives us faith that hong kong cinema is alive and flourishing . 
"
"i know what i would do with $4 . 4 million if i found it in a previously undiscovered airplane crash site , especially if i were with jacob and lou . 

 ( huh ? ) 

well , in any event , that is the situation hank ( paxton ) finds himself in . 

he and his dim-witted brother jacob ( thorton ) and tubby friend lou ( brent briscoe ) come upon a large bag of cash inside a plane wreck . 

against his better judgement , hank decides to go along with the idea of keeping it rather than going to the authorities . 

the rest of the film is a question of who is going to die to keep this a secret , and is it worth it ? 

a simple wish lies along the lines of very bad things , clay pigeons and even fargo , and is kind of wrapped all into one little dark bundle . 

oh , and its much better than any of those . 

sam raimi took a departure from his normal freak-show horror-monkey films and made this stylish and intriguing picture . 

he really lets the audience sit back and watch the events unfold rather than force them down our throats as many directors prefer to do . 

i think raimi knew he had a winner on his hands and decided to direct the picture on a natural flowing course . 

one of the film's components can be linked to a recurring theme in terrence malick's the thin red line . 

in malick's three hour bore-a-thon , he makes an interesting attempt to link mother earth to his war story . 

it seemed nothing more than an occasional pretty cut to a field of flowing grass , a small bird , or a flowing body of water . 

sure , there were obvious metaphorical connections , but there was no subtlty to his efforts . 

raimi does a fine job of tying in a fox in a chicken coop and birds of prey to signify the future of the characters . 

i think most viewers may miss the comparison , but it is a very intriguing ingredient in the film . 

and then there's billy bob thorton , who is proof that the independent film industry is vital to the life blood of hollywood . 

if it can continute to produce people like thorton , hollywood will be ok . 

he gives a fantastic and devastatingly deep performance here . 

it is not as engrossing as his carl childers character in slingblade , but is is just as complex , if not more so . 

jacob is slow and simple , and yet we so often see him deep in thought . 

i wondered if he was thinking about things that he would never say ( or didn't know how to say ) or if he was just taking a long time to think about the thing he just said . 

here he really proves his worth as one of the best character actors in the industry . 

though the plot is somewhat unoriginal , it has a very appealing new twist in its characters . 

paxton gives one of the better performances of his career as the straight and serious leader of the group ( a far cry from chet in wierd science ) . 

perhaps bridget fonda is miscast as his advice-giving wife , but she certainly doesn't do anything ruin the picture . 

a simple plan can be included in the group of recent small hollywood films that is just dark and pretty un-redeeming . 

but at least this one has an important message , unlike so many of its counterparts . 
"
"is evil dead ii a bad movie ? 

it's full of terrible acting , pointless violence , and plot holes yet it remains a cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release . 

explaining why this movie stands out from others with similar plots ( including the original evil dead ) is extremely difficult . 

`well what's it about ? ' 

`five people stranded in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere struggling to survive vicious attacks from a variety of ugly , hairy , wart covered monsters . ' 

`come on i saw a movie just like that on monster vision last week . 

why should i see it again ? ' 

`no evil dead ii is different , it's funny . ' 

`it's funny to see people die ? 

are you sick or something ? ' 

maybe i am and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of a movie . 

his unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle , as disturbing as it is hilarious . 

an example of raimi's odd approach : a monster ( formerly protagonist ash's girlfriend of all people ) is cut in half by a chainsaw and a tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound . 

sure it's over-the-top , but it is so over-the-top that it is laugh out loud funny ; just try watching ash with a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood , staining his face and knocking him back a few feet . 

the whole movie is like this , watch ash get beat up , watch ash defeat the monster , watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster . 

the more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets , the more amusing it becomes . 

no matter how sick it may sound , it is funny to watch bruce ampbell's ash get his butt kicked every five minutes . 

and raimi takes advantage , he has ash tormented by the head of his girlfriend , by the body of an old lady , even by his own right hand . 

like the less superior idle hands , we watch ash uncontrollably hit himself over and over again until he is forced to cut off his own body part . 

but it doesn't end , ash now has to fight his severed hand which now moves with the same celerity as thing from the addams family . 

all of these events , thrown at you from minute one with roller coaster- like camera movements , at first become shocking , then inexplicably funny . 

raimi expects the audience to laugh and as the film progresses , he seems to be enjoying himself even more by borrowing the classic mirror scene from the marx brothers' duck soup , then bringing more characters into the picture to comically kill them off . 

with a running time of less than an hour and a half , raimi gets away with the impossible , making a horror film with more gore than plot and intentionally more laughs than scares . 

ending evil dead ii with an opening for the third film in the series , raimi obviously had a lot of fun making this movie and couldn't wait to make it's sequel . 
"
" "" the blair witch project "" was perhaps one of a kind , a unique film that played completely on its own merit , managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses . 

its success made a sequel inevitable , but this is not the sequel , i suspect , anyone much wanted . 

after the release of "" the blair witch project "" , tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville , in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch . 

locals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity , selling twig-sculptures , stones and dirt like those in the movie , and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn , shouting , "" get out of these woods and go home ! 

there is no goddamned blair witch ! "" . 

jeff ( ) is one of those people , who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage . 

after he got released from the mental institution , he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet . 

as the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods , on the "" blair witch hunt "" . 

among the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend , the pregnant tristen , who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called "" the blair witch : history or hysteria ? "" , and kim , who dresses in black and has some psychic powers . 

the last member of the crew is erica , a young beautiful witch-wannabe , who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore , saying "" the first rule of wicca is , do no harm , because whatever you do will come back to you threefold . "" 

this strange group plunges into the woods , where they begin to argue about their different approaches to the experience . 

on the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parr's abandoned house , strange things start happening . 

when they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tapes remain . 

after a while they discover strange markings on their bodies . 

they are somehow lost in time , as it loops uncontrollably back and forth . 

they are all haunted by hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality . 

the only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods . . 

documentary director joe berlinger ( "" paradice lost "" ) helms "" blair witch 2 "" , leaving the creators of the first film ( dan myrick and ed sanches ) in the background . 

the opening scenes--the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film-- is a more promising approach , because instead of trying to cover similar ground , it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand . 

but soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story , that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue . 

in a way , this is a typical hollywood sequel . 

more money has been spent and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail . 

the horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated . 

of course in these situations , quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values . 

from its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody-red forest , with carter burwell's ( "" being john malkovich "" and "" fargo "" ) musical score in the background , you realize that with the exception of its title , this film has absolutely nothing to do with "" the blair witch project "" . 

 "" blair witch . . "" 

was filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation . 

in the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection , creating a completely different atmosphere . 

with its graceful cinematography , production design and flashy editing , the film has a very polished look , which is impossible to associate with the first installment . 

and though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times , he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor . 

the key is simplicity . 

 "" blair witch project "" had a story which was incredibly simple . 

that allowed the audience to fill the gaps with our own imagination . 

the film was practically an empty screen , on which we projected our most frightening nightmares . 

the effect was incredibly powerful , lasting and entir e everyone , but in a different way . 

 "" book of shadows "" feels incredibly controlled and restrict . 

here , very little is left to our imagination and the story is so complex and "" clever "" that the screenwriters are the first to get lost in it . 

there is is no book of shadows and no conclusion that we can be satisfied with . 

this is simply a less artistic film that doesn't have the talent and originality of its predecessor . 

it resorts to fancy cinematography and special effects to create the right effect and doesn't always succeed . 

but most importantly : it stands on its own ground and has almost no connection with the first movie , which doesn't allow it to destroy the original . 

in the end , i can't call it a bad effort . 

it's less artistic , not so scary and less original , but certainly not bad . 

it's simply different . 

in fact , if you haven't seen "" the blair witch project "" , you might like this film for what it is -- a cross between "" the blair witch project "" and the "" scream "" -films . 

the only element that remains constant and similar between the two films is the solid acting ( jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned ) and incredible sense of surrealism . 

but it's a common knowledge and experience that , with a few exceptions , every movie sequel is worse than the original and some are even not worth making . 

to me the story of "" the blair witch project "" seemed completed , but there are obviously no limits to commercial success that "" the book of shadows "" is certainly assured . 

and it's already time to look forward to "" blair witch 3 "" . 
"
"every year , hollywood crowns a new "" it boy "" --a young actor pegged for major movie stardom . 

inheriting the mantle from last year's "" winner , "" matthew mcconaughey , is matt damon , and , like mcconaughey , he proves to be more than just a fresh young face , as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in release--john grisham's the rainmaker and good will hunting . 

damon has his first major starring role , a la mcconaughey , in a john grisham adaptation--in this case , francis ford coppola's take on the rainmaker . 

damon plays wet-behind-the-ears attorney rudy baylor , who , immediately after passing the bar exam , finds himself representing the mother ( mary kay place ) of a terminally ill young man ( john whitworth ) in a big-league suit against a negligent insurance company . 

while rudy's ( and the film's ) main concern is this case , he also finds time to protect a young wife ( claire danes ) from her abusive husband ( melrose placer andrew shue , in a mercifully brief role ) . 

written for the screen and directed by coppola , the rainmaker is the best grisham film yet mostly because it does not take itself too seriously . 

coppola's most notable--and effective--contribution to the tried-and-true grisham formula is a sense of humor about itself , which largely comes in the presence of danny devito ( as rudy's unlicensed co-counsel ) and golden globe nominee jon voight ( as the insurance company's hotshot attorney ) . 

the inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous , but danes is as superb as always . 

then , of course , there is damon , who nicely juggles the weighty ( the insurance case , the spousal abuse ) and the humorous ( rudy's often comical naivete ) requirements of his role without missing a beat . 

as good as he is in the rainmaker , damon showcases the depth of his talent in good will hunting , directed by gus van sant and written by actor ben affleck and damon himself . 

damon plays the title character , will hunting , a troubled young construction worker/janitor at mit who also happens to be a supergenius . 

in an attempt to steer this brilliant young mind in the right direction , an mit math professor ( stellan skarsgard ) taps his old college friend , community college psychologist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , to counsel the abrasive , standoffish will and try to help him come to terms with his turbulent life . 

good will hunting is the touchy-feely enterprise its plot synopsis suggests , but to simply dismiss it as that would be to discount the true emotional chords affleck and damon's intelligent script touches . 

even though no one ( and , if so , _very_ few people ) can directly relate to will's burden of superhuman intelligence , the insecurities he suffers are universal . 

the material is brought to life by the terrific ensemble of actors . 

williams delivers a nice dramatic turn ; affleck , a hot up-and-coming actor himself ( chasing amy ) , turns up in a warm and charming performance as will's best friend ; and the ever-appealing minnie driver shines as will's harvard-schooled love interest . 

the clear standout in the cast , though , is damon , who bravely does not soften will's prickly nature but has such a natural ease with the audience that it is hard _not_ to care for him . 

so many names come and go with the fluctuations of the hollywood hype machine , but based on his impressive work in john grisham's the rainmaker and especially good will hunting , it is a safe bet that matt damon is one name we will be hearing a lot more of in the years to come . 
"
"in many ways , "" twotg "" does for tough-guy movies what la confidential did for police stories . 

there's savviness in its writing and a mature patience in allowing the material to unfold . 

but , i suppose , we wouldn't expect less from christopher mcquarrie , who was responsible for giving us "" the usual suspects "" . 

his writing talents are still in tact as he brings to us a bloody yet intellectual tale of two unabashed but dimwitted thugs and a plan gone awry . 

the two goons are parker and longbaugh ( ryan phillipe and benicio del toro ) . 

these two men show the hardened wear of those who have always had it tough . 

their troubled youths have forged two nihilistic souls who use their amazing gunplay skills to survive . 

given the choice of minimum wage or petty crime , they'll always choose the latter . 

yet , they are incredibly foolish planners . 

actually , these two never really have a plan . 

they just improvise along the way , hoping that their bravado and arsenal of guns will take care of anything that they might have overlooked . 

their next scheme , which they cook up about as fast as a mcdonald's burger , is to kidnap some surrogate mother named robin ( juliette lewis ) that was hired by some well-to-do family . 

if all goes well , they'll receive a nice bit of ransom money and life goes on . 

what parker and longbaugh do not realize is that robin is carrying a baby for the chidduck family , whose patriarch is a feared crime boss . 

moreover , two bodyguards ( nicky katt and taye diggs ) constantly escort her . 

these two protectors find an eerie sense of pleasure when being confronted and tested in life and death situations . 

they would rather die than fail ; thus their bravado level is equally high . 

but it seems that the testosterone levels of parker and longbaugh are a bit higher , and they employ some unusual but fun-to-watch tactics to pull off the kidnapping and to outrun the pursuers in a sort of slow-motion car chase down a series of alleyways . 

the next hour or so , we watch the chidduck camp regroup and assess their situation . 

during this time , additional plot lines come into play and more and more details are revealed . 

because the chidduck's can not go to the police and because of the special circumstances involving the kidnapping , we are introduced to more characters that will help to influence the outcome . 

we discover that not everyone in the chidduck camp is loyal to the cause . 

as a result , there are undercurrents of a conspiracy , and elements of betrayal and subterfuge . 

the sepia-toned atmosphere is made all the more fascinating thanks to a terrific soundtrack which emits velvet forebodings , shrills of intrigue and crescendos that tell us of life and death situations that are about to occur . 

the momentum and the coolness of the film , however , begins to fizzle in the last 30 minutes , which featured an overly extended shootout where our two desperados try to make their way off with the ransom money . 

you can expect lots of bloodletting and an odd denouement . 

in fact , you may admire this film more than you like it . 

yet , for the most part , "" the way of the gun "" stays on target . 

it feels cool with its elements of conspiracy and gunplay , and smart for its invective dialogue and tough guy poetry . 
"
"nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama con air . 

the opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe , a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill-fated bar-room brawl . 

the prison scenes are accompanied by voice-overs in which poe , in a languid southern drawl , describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met . 

if the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should . 

cage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim-witted and ridiculous , and that he's going to have to do something to keep himself entertained . 

and thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed-up version of raising arizona's h . i . mcdonnough . 

cage should have known what he was getting himself into . 

he got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock , and if there's one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner don simpson ) , it's that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production . 

the critical difference between the rock and con air is cage's performance . 

in the rock , cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time . 

that sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self-awareness . 

while the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home , cage's goal is different but just as simple : to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact . 

audiences , too , should know what they're getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production . 

in fact , the marketing people are counting on it . 

no one who loathed the rock for its swear-grunt-blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air ; no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded . 

director simon west ( yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab's soda fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it's perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ; like insulin , con air does the work of a gland ) . 

what he doesn't deliver is a moment of suspense . 

a bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock's notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really , _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely . 

if either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension , they might have done something with con air's creepiest set-up . 

at a desert stop for the plane-load of convicts , serial killer garland greene ( steve buscemi ) wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool . 

their tete-a-tete is eerie and menacing , providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains ( danny trejo , ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them ) . 

in fact , con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- too many characters , too much editing , too many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts . 

it is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance . 

while malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack ( as a u . s . marshal ) goes for earnest , cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep . 

his recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape , his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies . 

it doesn't bode well for cage's appearance in face/off later this month ; perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over . 

there's a word for people like you , nicolas . 

that word is called recidivist . . . repeat 

offender .

be forewarned . 

 "" all the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts "" - excerpt from as you like it , act ii , scene 7 

when william shakespeare penned this passage , he could not have possibly envisioned a world in which the domestic activites in an abode would be broadcast across the continent , or where women would install webcams in their apartments in order to convert voyeurism into cash . 

this is the world of today , and it is the perfect climate to unveil a prototypical high-concept project like the truman show . 

truman burbank ( jim carrey ) seems to have the perfect life . 

he has a pretty , doting wife meryl ( laura linney ) , a comfortable insurance sales position , an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic island community of seahaven , a reliable childhood buddy marlon ( noah emmerich ) -- except for the dog that paws a greeting to him every morning and his hydrophobia , this is paradise . 

or so it would seem . 

bizarre , inexplicable incidents begin to crop up in truman's life . 

a lighting fixture unexpectedly plummets from the sky . 

a rainstorm which gives new meaning to the term 'isolated' follows him around . 

a radio broadcast appears to be describing his every move . 

for the first time in his life , it is beginning to dawn on truman that things are not what they appear to be . 

the truman show , directed by peter weir and written by andrew niccol , is a remarkably well-constructed film , paced perfectly with every scene fluidly leading into the next . 

balancing drama with humour , thoughtfulness with abandon , this is a film which addresses an intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of sermonizing and whimsical fancy . 

in many ways , mr . niccol's screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous gattaca -- both films focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity , with pivotal , character-defining moments occurring at sea . 

although the film's rather conventional climax doesn't sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first two-thirds , and ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch , there are moments through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving as truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception . 

despite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film , it remains foremost a finely-crafted piece of entertainment , constantly light and accessible . 

the tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude , and as the carefully-stacked seahaven house of cards tumbles down , the film eschews any psychological ramifications for a man discovering that the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false . 

the end act of the truman show essentially boils down to a rehash of the reliable , crowdpleasing underdog vs . 

the system formula . 

while the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept , some elements are lacking . 

the device of mysterious lauren/sylvia ( natascha mcelhone ) as a contributing impetus to truman's growing awareness isn't exactly convincing . 

there's not much of a discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors themselves , and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff ( ed harris ) with regards to the moral ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the audience , thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film . 

in fact , although the film smartly restricts the number of scenes depicting the real world outside truman's artificial utopia to a mere handful of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers , it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even * more * deeply in the insulatory seahaven world , with the resultant effect that the repercussions felt as the film finally shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling . 

still , the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target , and its insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright anti-voyeuristic tirades such as that of the recent costa gavras film mad city . 

i've always believed that the versatile ms . linney possesses a tremendous comic gift -- she has always seems to have a impish gleam in her eyes -- and in the truman show she runs rampant with her duplicitous character , mischievously flashing a glazed , insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans . 

cheerfully going over the top , it's hilarious to watch her -- who would have ever guessed that she'd have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laughs department of a film ? 

ms . linney is a delight in the film . 

but it is mr . carrey who rules the show here . 

he may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank -- the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interludes which typify his traditional parts -- but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal : it's difficult not to root for truman . 

in a commanding performance , mr . carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which makes him a genuinely engaging presence , and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn , demonstrating admirable restraint -- there's an early scene where he's down on his knees gardening , and given his past track record , one almost instinctively anticipates mr . carrey to pull one of more infamous , and in this case , wholly inappropriate sight gags . 

it's almost poetic how this notorious look-at-me actor successfully tones it down to play a character who's constantly the centre of attention . 

in addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast -- mr . emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthiness -- the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating truman's antiseptic , white picket-fenced smalltown utopia , and by burkhard dallwitz's original score . 

technical credits are first-rate all around . 

while the truman show is clearly a definitive high-concept film , it's not exactly a dazzlingly innovative one -- obvious predecessors utilising common elements abound , ranging from 1965's secret agent through to the groundbreaking british 1967 tv series the prisoner . 

all the same , this is a visionary , award-calibre film : entertaining , provocative , and intelligent . 

the curious ( and possibly disturbing ) thing may be that although upon first glance the plausibility of the film's concept seems unfathomably outrageous , it's abundantly clear that our society is rapidly approaching , if not actualisation , at least permissiveness of such a scenario . 

perhaps the highest compliment which can be paid to mr . weir is that his depiction of this bizarro state is so convincing that we accept it without question . 

perhaps we recognize a bit of ourselves in this world .

"like a good action film should , "" metro "" has action that keeps you involved . 

some action films have action sequences that are so conventional , our attention is detracted and diverted by other thoughts . 

 "" the ghost in the darkness , "" which opened a few months ago , is a film that s action was so bland and uninvolving , it not only invited my thoughts to divert me , it nearly put me asleep . 

but "" metro "" is one of the best action films in a while . 

it is hip , sharp , nifty , and has nice little pieces of suspense and comedy . 

eddie murphy was in bad shape for a while . 

and this invites me to mention last year s "" the nutty professor , "" which was his blessed revival back to the position at which he used to be . 

 "" metro "" happens to be a lot better than any film in the "" beverly hills cop "" series . 

that is because "" metro "" takes itself seriously , but doesn t prevent itself from having a little fun . 

eddie murphy is at his best in the roles of responsible , and controlled people . 

the "" beverly hills cop "" movies all featured eddie as a reckless , wild cop , always crossing the line by just an inch . 

in "" metro "" he plays a hostage negotiator , so negotiation is his job , not his hobby or his preferred way out of trouble . 

his character in "" metro "" takes himself seriously . 

eddie murphy s mischievous trademark grin is hardly anywhere to be found in "" metro , "" and perhaps it is quite better off that way . 

murphy plays scott roper , and as i previously mentioned , he is a san francisco hostage negotiator . 

in the first tense situation in the film , we are introduced to roper s kind of work , as he tries to calm down a confused , unkempt young criminal who has taken captive the entire capacity of the san francisco bank he is holding up . 

murphy handles the scene seriously , without his usual happy-go-lucky , misfit humor . 

the film develops when its villain is established , and the villain here is the beguiling michael korda , a jewel thief , and murderer who likes to let cops know of his hostage fatalities by giving them the ear of the victim . 

 "" metro "" takes different twists and slight turns , and there is one great , virtuoso chase scene , involving the a cable car . 

cars flip . 

cars crash . 

cars turn over . 

and it is done so good in this film , i was reminded of "" speed , "" and the speeding bus that couldn t go under fifty mile per hour for very significant reasons . 

there are also some other good scenes in "" metro "" that a lot of films would rather choose not to have . 

scenes like the one with roper and his new partner are at the horse track roper is a gambler who knows all the tricks and roper teaches his partner a few little methods of betting and winning . 

of course , the writers tried to disguise the scene as being insignificant by having roper draw parallels between hostage negotiation and gambling . 

the scenes between roper and his girlfriend are nice , too . 

those are the scenes that make up "" metro , "" which is mainly about eddie murphy s maturing as a personality . 

the actor that i most enjoyed seeing in "" metro "" was michael rapaport , who plays roper s new partner , a lip-reading , book-skimming genius , and a master of observation . 

it was not the actor s presence that pleased me as much as the role he was cast in the role of a proclaimed genius . 

rapaport is an actor who i usually see in the role of the dimwit the really , really dopey dimwit . 

i hardly recognized him in "" metro , "" and it was quite a joy to be able to see him in a role like this i feel that i respect him more . 

there are two main types of villains in movies like this : the ones that are part of the story , and the ones that are devices . 

the villain in "" metro "" is no more than a device , but he is a darn good villain nonetheless . 

he is played by michael wincott , whose voice is pushed out in a abraded rasp , as if he smokes a cigarette between every take . 

wincott makes his villain , korda , as mean as could be , the classic type of villain who would push an old lady down a flight of stairs just for kicks , like richard widmark in "" kiss of death . "" 

and , in addition , wincott s physical appearance and mannerisms , in the film , actually reminded my of an arrogant friend i use to have , who is no longer on my good list . 

i liked "" metro , "" and i do not think would have worked with any other actor but eddie murphy . 

his past roles were the great ones but they were also a precursor to the maturing that would later take place , possibly from murphy s growing as a person , now having a family . 

 "" metro "" is a no-nonsense movie . 

it works as a buddy movie , which it does not overplay . 

it works as a dry comedy , which it does not overplay . 

it works as a suspense film , which it does not overplay . 

and it works as an action film , where it does have a tendency to occasionally go all-out . 

but who cares ? 

it still remains serious , and it does not overdo itself . 

oh , and there were plenty of explosions in "" metro , "" as well . 

how nice it was of the filmmakers to give us those . 

if there is one major objection i had to "" metro "" , it was the length , an area where a lot of action films seem to wear out their welcomes . 

 "" metro "" is a film that lasted a little too long , but it was still entertaining , and it gave me something to do while i waited for it to end .

"battlefield long , boring and just plain stupid 

battlefield earth 

a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman 

in my mid-teen years , i had a horrendous re-occurring nightmare . 

behind the wheel of a car , i was driving down a straight road in the middle of a desert . 

no scenery except the horizon line and the converging parallel lines of the highway . 

no matter what i did , the view didn't change : travelling but not getting anywhere . 

each time i awoke in a sweat , terrified . 

you don't have to be carl jung to understand that dream . 

powerless to make changes , trapped in a boring situation with no hope of rescue , this is the stuff of nightmares whether we are asleep or awake . 

this is exactly how you will feel 15 minutes after "" battlefield earth "" begins . 

for all of its flash and style , l . ron hubbard's science fiction epic is the earliest and best entry for the dullest summer film of 2000 . 

dull "" and "" stupid . 

in the year 3000 , the psychlo aliens have ruled our planet for 1 , 000 years . 

humans either work as slave labor in mining operations or live as barbarians . 

there's no hope . 

the future is bleak . 

then the psychlo make a mistake and capture feisty jonnie goodboy tyler ( barry pepper ) who organizes a revolution against chief of security terl ( john travolta ) and the alien race . 

it's an archetypal post-apocalyptic plot full of promise . 

considering some of the talent involved and all the millions thrown at the screen , it's difficult to see how it could have failed so miserably . 

but it does . 

the story is so full of holes that it falls apart within minutes of the opening credits . 

are we really supposed to believe that after a millennium of looking for gold , the psychlo never discovered fort knox ? 

or that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that time -- and gassed up ? 

or that the cavemen become such expert pilots in seven days that they can easily down the advanced alien ships ? 

or that the psychlo spy cameras somehow don't notice that their slaves are missing for days ? 

travolta prances across the screen hamming it up for all he's worth and is almost entertaining . 

almost . 

the rest of the actors are wooden mannequins trying not to laugh while delivering lines that no person -- "" man-animal "" or not -- would ever utter . 

some of the film _looks_ good , but it also looks so familiar . 

a race of large hulking ape-like creatures has taken over the world while our cities lie in ruin . 

sound like something charlton heston might be in ? 

the psychlo look like overweight klingons in gear from "" dune "" . 

the final air battle between the air force fighters and the psychlo ships in their high-tech city is something george lucas might have been associated with . 

it's too loud . 

it's too oppressive . 

it's too slow . 

it's too long . . . far 

too long . 

and on it goes . 

the list of the problems with "" battlefield earth "" is endless . 

it's difficult to find anything in the film that does work . 

oh yeah . 

the color scheme is nice . 

the real question is how this movie ever got made . 

could it have something to do with the fact that l . ron hubbard was the founder of scientology ? 

and that john travolta is a member of the church . 

that might explain why travolta bought the rights to the novel years ago . 

but it doesn't give us a clue as to why first-time screenwriter corey mandell's atrocious script was used . 

or why the high-profile project was entrusted with roger christian who had never before directed a major film . 

or why no one looked at this thing before it was released and realized there might be problems . 

the one bright spot is that no longer will kevin costner's "" the postman "" ( which i begrudgingly admit as a guilty pleasure ) be "" the "" big budget science fiction failure . 

 "" battlefield earth "" has the honor sewed up . 

often reviewers will recommend that you skip mediocre films and wait for the video . 

that's not the case here . 

you can act now and make the decision to not see it on the big screen or on the small one . 

don't hesitate . 

strike now while the iron is cold .

"the party is one of those classic slapstick comedies that will leave you , at times , cracking up . 

the film takes place , for the most part , in real-time during an exclusive evening party that is attended only by the biggest names in hollywood . 

hrundi v . bakshi , played very well by peter sellers , is a struggling actor who just came to america from his homeland , india . 

hrundi tries out his acting talents , but it seems that he just isn't cut out for the job . 

on the set of his current film that he stars in , hrundi seems to make everything go for the worse . 

during the filming of this movie set in the 1800's , hrundi manages to annoy the director ( herbert ellis ) in any way he can . 

this includes a pitiful acting job in many scenes , wearing an underwater watch in one scene , and accidentally detonating a massive set . 

many of the hollywood producers and big names want hrundi out of the business forever . 

and when the director makes a personal phone call to mr . clutterbuck ( j . 

edward mckinley ) pleading for hrundi's ejection from hollywood , everything is pretty much over for hrundi . 

clutterbuck writes his name down on a piece of paper to insure that hrundi will never again work in hollywood . 

but when this piece of paper turns out to be the guest list for clutterbuck's exclusive party , hrundi is invited , and certain chaos is bound to occur . 

of course , as predicted , hrundi causes lots of trouble . 

each scene in which hrundi encounters a situation , usually one that he can't handle , is almost always very humorous . 

and each scene with hrundi and the drunken waiter , who is alone hilarious , adds to the comedy in a great way . 

the party can be compared to many other films of it's type , specifically the trio of naked gun movies and the airplane movies , but the party is a delightful movie that incorporates very well played out comedy into believable situations . 

it also includes a number of memorable scenes ( can anyone say "" birdy num-num "" ? ) . 

if you're in the mood for fun and enjoyable slapstick comedy , check out the party . 

it's not going to be one of your all-time favorites , but if you enjoy this type of humor , you'll enjoy the party . 
"
"you would think that this film's dismal failure would be due to american filmmakers getting hold of a brilliant british comedy and "" americanizing "" it . 

you'd be wrong , since full blame can be placed on the very folks who wrote and created the series : rowan atkinson , robin driscoll , and richard curtis . 

should you ever happen to meet those chaps , do me a favor . 

grab them by the hair and yell really loudly in their ear , "" what were you thinking ? ! 

have you ever heard the phrase 'if it ain't broke don't fix it' ? ! "" 

then walk away . 

the film concerns mr . bean ( atkinson ) and his visit to america while escorting the painting of "" whistler's mother "" to an american buyer ( played by burt reynolds , in the type of bit part that his success in "" boogie nights "" should hopefully do away with ) . 

now how or why mr . bean is sent on this trip makes no sense , and i can't even describe how the film explains it . 

the point is that mr . bean comes to america and causes wacky trouble . 

problems problems problems , where to begin ? 

first , the score music from the tv show has been completely replaced by score that is either at times one note away from the score from "" beetlejuice "" or one note away from the score from "" rob roy "" . 

then , the song choices are totally uninspired . 

 "" good vibrations "" ? 

 "" i love l . a . "" ? 

wow , don't put any thought into that guys . 

also , bean makes way too much noise in the film . 

the character doesn't speak much , but in the series you really only heard the laughter of the audience , and maybe the occasional murmur from mr . bean . 

each episode was like a chaplin silent movie . 

in the film , bean is constantly moaning , grunting , whining , etc . it's annoying , and just plain wrong for the character . 

the main problem though is that it's just not funny . 

with each episode of the series there would be dozens of really great laughs crammed into less than 30 minutes . 

multiply that running time by three however , and the laughs steadily decrease . 

they even have the gaul to repeat jokes from the series . 

sad , and creatively lazy . 

as a series , "" mr . bean "" only ran for about 13 episodes or so . 

why on earth did atkinson and the gang decide it was time to completely rework everything ? 

13 half-hour episodes certainly hadn't exhausted all possible situations . 

all i can say positively for the film at this point is that it's almost appropriate for all ages , if it wasn't for a couple of scenes where it appears as though mr . bean is having sex with things . 

and even that isn't a very positive statement . 

please guys , go back to england and go back to television so you'll make me laugh again .

"bats is this year's camp flick . 

with the world's worst dialogue , cheesiest premise and stupidest editor , this one should be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity . 

as for the rest of us , well . . . 

i'd say skip it , but looking at the box office figures for this one , it seems as though most of america is following that advice anyway . 

follow their lead and you'll spare yourself 90 minutes of your life and 8 bucks to boot . 

i love alfred hitchcock's the birds , almost as much as i love the short story on which it is based . 

it saddens me even more , then , to see that american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horror/schlock such as bats . 

when mysterious bat attacks occur in a small texas town , the authorities call in a batologist ( dina meyer ) to investigate . 

it turns out that a creepy scientist ( bob gunton ) has genetically enhanced a couple bats that escaped from his lab , making them smarter and more vicious . 

why has he done this , you ask ? 

because , you see , it is apparently a scientist's job to make things "" a little better , "" even if that means the death of all mankind . 

so the batologist , her wisecracking sidekick and the town sheriff ( lou diamond phillips ) have to kill all the bats and save the world . 

of course , that can't happen before they wallow in some guamo ( bat shit , for the uninitiated ) , get up close and personal with some truly repulsive flying mammals and survive some of the dumbest situations ever seen in a professionally produced motion picture . 

consider , for example , a scene where two people are in a bat cave . 

the bats are all sleeping , but the humans are afraid they might wake up before they can get out . 

what do they do ? 

do they get the hell out of there as fast as they can ? 

nope . 

they stand there for a while , transfixed by the thousands of bats opening their eyes . 

what keeps bats from being scary or creepy is the hyperactive editing in most of the attack scenes . 

we don't even get to see what's going on ; the screen becomes a mush because the cuts are so quick . 

all we know is that bats are attacking . 

how they are attacking and what exactly is happening remains a mystery . 

a little technical proficiency does wonders for horror movies , and bats sure could use some . 

of course , director louis morneau tries to liven things up with some intentional humor , but it is so conventional it doesn't really go anywhere . 

most of the ocmic relief comes courtesy of the batologist's wisecracking sidekick ( leon ) , who takes every opportunity to sputter ingenious lines like "" i hate bats ! "" 

some of these are so bad that they take on a double quality : they may inspire a smirk by their very nature and a roaring laugh because they are so inept . 

i hate characters who exist for the sole purpose of spouting lame one-liners . 

playing such characters does not help actors' careers . 

still , i suppose that if you're looking for a movie that is "" so bad it's good , "" you could do worse than bats . 

it does have a tremendous amount of camp value . 

i'm not "" recommending "" the movie because , quite frankly , it sucks , and i know that this might convince some people to go out and see it . 

more power to them . 
"
">from the commercials , this looks like a mild-mannered neil simonesque tale with mary tyler moore baring her bra touted as the highlight . 

instead it turns out to be a hilarious film running in high gear from beginning to end . 

the concept is deceptively pedestrian . 

an adult adopted son is looking for his biological parents and encounters eccentric characters along the way . 

the movie demonstrates just how far a good script and actors can take a mundane idea . 

the son and his wife take off on the search accompanied by a woman from the agency who located his parents . 

following one dead end lead after another , each funnier than the previous , they eventually end up in new mexico with his real biological parents : alan alda and lily tomlin . 

it's difficult to condense the mile-a-minute plot . 

seemingly hundreds of scenes jump on top of each other without giving you a chance to recover from the last one . 

without giving too much away , one of the better episodes involves a gay federal alcohol , tobacco and firearms agent attempting an arrest while tripping on lsd as his bi-sexual partner is upstairs licking the armpit of a woman while her husband is in the next room seducing their traveling companion . 

and it's all done in a fairly clean , almost ( well , maybe not exactly ) family fare manner . 

a grand cast ( tomlin , alda , moore , ben stiller , patricia arquette , tea leoni , george segal ) interacts in a seamless parade of laughs . 

drawing from a more hyper woody allen style , the film succeeds beyond expectations . 
"
"there're so many things to criticize about i don't know where to start . 

recommendation : turn off your brain - don't be like me , decreasing the rating everyday because i think about it too much . 

a comet is about to strike earth , causing a catastrophe similar to the extinction level event ( e . l . e . ) that wiped out the dinosaurs . 

what follows is the story of a president's bid to think for the good of his people , a rising reporter , the love story of two teenagers ( one of whom discovered the comet ) , and a team of astronauts on the ship `messiah' to save the world . 

firstly , there is nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of the film ( nor is there anything outstandingly good about it ) , but the plot holes make the film corny and stupid . 

to be honest , i was more moved by the trailer than the film itself ( which isn't saying much ) . 

mimi leder's follow-up to `the peacemaker' is equally incompetent , with all the big stars wasted . 

 ( perhaps i'm just annoyed that the release of `the peacemaker' in the us overshadowed a far superior thriller , `the assignment' . ) 

it is very obvious that the title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision , but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives . 

however , the film simply fails on that note . 

the effects are worn-out , the substandard screenplay limited the acting , and the director continued her sad run in terms of good-film-making credentials . 

she's still making good money though . 

t ? a leoni's unfortunate character , the news reporter , is the foundation of the story and of the cast . 

but the film suffers from too many characters that do not need to be explored . 

robert duvall's aging astronaut is lifeless , and morgan freeman's president is restricted to , well , a righteous president ( which means he's not interesting at all ) . 

leoni's character is the only appealing one , and is played with reasonable conviction ( but a rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc ) , but was definitely undervalued by the director and screenwriters . 

warning : spoilers included ( but a lot of it is irrelevant and predictable anyway ) . 

plot holes , plot holes , plot holes . 

now , e . l . e . 

is threatening to exterminate more than 99% of the human race , and they send eight puny little nuclear bombs up there ? 

where's the logic ? 

leder could have at least made it plausible with 20 . 

and then it turns out that only a few percent of the world population actually perish , and those less selfish ones ( the ones that stayed at home ) were the victims . 

the film was almost mocking them , telling them they had died for nothing . 

i also fail to see how two teenagers , carrying a baby , would be the first to climb up the mountain/hill , even with a motorbike for a head-start . 

it's unlikely that the dust will take just two years to settle , but that doesn't really matter . 

building caves was a strategy mentioned in `dr . 

strangelove' , which proposed that people lived underground for one hundred or so years . 

now that is a more practical use for caves . 

what is the point of living in caves ? 

there is no , unlike `dr . 

strangelove' , any radioactivity outside to restrict exposure . 

how do plants grow ? 

if humans have the technology to keep plants alive in caves , there's no reason why they can't do it in the open . 

the president disclosed that other countries have been preparing their own caves . 

obviously this means that the other countries were informed a long time ago , and you can't be serious to say that nobody leaked the news to the media . 

in an important mission like that of the `messiah' , for that matter any mission , it is impossible that isn't sufficient fuel for an extra couple of hundred metres , needless to say tens of kilometres . 

this is not deep impact ? it's a frivolous cheap impact . 

but even with all that , some overacting , and a 3 . 4 rating , it's still watchable , just don't think about it . 

okay ?

buy a disney t-shirt ! 

eat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick ! 

it's both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it . 

dale carnegie should have had it so good . 

what's most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality . 

you see , disney animated features these days have two components : theme and plot . 

the theme changes with each new movie ; the plot does not . 

the plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped , and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features , they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same . 

however , while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box-office receipts , merchandising dollars , and glimmers in the eyes of little children , critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer . 

luckily , disney's latest animated offering , mulan , manages to be engaging and refreshing , even while rife with formula . 

the film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns , led by the imposing shan-yu ( miguel ferrer ) . 

soon , china's emperor ( pat morita ) mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china's defense . 

when the fa family is served notice , it is the elderly father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) who must answer the call , as there are no other males in the household . 

fearing her father will surely be killed in battle , fa mulan ( ming-na wen ) disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army . 

mulan , based on a chinese epic poem , is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling . 

mulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family , as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman's role , and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband , we see that "" grace "" is not one of her strong points . 

very early on , we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one's family , and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker , mulan fails at that task . 

by leaving home to fight in her father's place , she may not only spare his life , but bring honor , too . 

as is the case with most disney musicals , the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film . 

i'm not sure if they will get much airplay , but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time . 

both lea salonga , who provides the singing voice for mulan , and donny osmond who sings for shang , the captain of mulan's army unit and obligatory love interest , are more than competent , although salonga's voice translates much better to animation . 

you have to hear it to understand . 

interestingly , the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan . 

there is no significantly big number , which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film , but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie . 

it is , however , an expectation which has been built by disney's own formulaic history , and some viewers may feel as if something is missing . 

artistically , the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork , and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works , it helps to contribute a more authentic , and therefore more credible , nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically "" disneyfied "" ethnic tale . 

there are also a couple of visually standout scenes , one involving the charge of shan-yu's hun army , which utilizes the same computer-enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast . 

the other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it . 

when mulan resolves to take her father's place , she dons her father's old battle armor , and unsheathes a sword . 

as she does so , you can see her reflection in the polished metal . 

it just left me thinking , "" that was really cool . "" 

a wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film , varying from the straight , such as soon-tek oh as fa zhou , to the comical , such as harvey fierstein as yao , a gruff , pugilistic member of shang's conscripted army . 

even more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu , the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan . 

although an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin , murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance . 

i found the choice of b . d . 

wong as shang a little strange ( you may remember him as martin short's wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride ) , but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast , so i guess anything's possible . 

in any event , wong performs admirably as well . 

one character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa . 

she deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie , but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people . 

june foray , who supplies grandmother fa's speaking voice , is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale ( as in boris and natasha ) . 

marni nixon , who provides grandmother fa's singing voice , is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king and i , maria in west side story , and eliza in my fair lady . 

with this in mind , hearing grandmother fa is like listening to a little piece of history . 

mulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films . 

in an effort to be culturally sensitive ( and to avoid a "" miss saigon "" -type debacle ) , disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asian-american actors for both lead and supporting roles . 

in addition to the actors already mentioned , the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong , gedde watanabe , james shigeta , and george takei . 

i guess clyde kusatsu wasn't available . 

at a running time of slightly under an hour and a half , mulan moves quickly and provides solid entertainment for both children and , happily , adults . 

this is the kind of disney feature that makes you wonder what they will do next , rather than hope that the next one is better .

"very few people would be unaware of beavis & butt-head ( both created and narrated by mike judge ) . 

they are the two animated mtv characters who have the most annoying laughter know to human kind . 

you may have seen them on their television program , as they snigger and make lude remarks about women , anything related to sex , and the music film clips that they watch . 

in beavis & butt-head do america the pair finally make their big screen debut , to the delight of some , and the deplore of others . 

beavis & butt-head ( yes , those are their real names ) , are two very ugly teenagers with extremely warped minds driven by raging hormones . 

they live their lives in front of the television . 

the worst possible event occurs to the pair when their television is stolen . 

this happens as they sleep , and when they awake it takes them a few minutes just to decipher that the television has gone . 

beavis even tries to use the remote , though there is no television there . 

the two spot a van outside and two sinister looking men carrying a television . 

even at this point they have no idea what has happened . 

they look around , seeing all the evidence , but are completely oblivious to the fact that these men have just stolen their television . 

before the movie i knew that they were stupid , but i didn't realise just how stupid . 

this is typical of their behaviour throughout the film . 

eventually they realise that their television has been stolen , so they leave their sofa to go search for a television . 

luck would have it that they stumble into a hotel room ( looking for a television ) where a man is awaiting two guys whose task it is to kill his wife . 

this man , thinking that beavis & butt-head are the assigned killers , tells them that they can have $10 , 000 if they "" do his wife "" . 

beavis & butt-head , being the ignorant fools that they are , think that he is offering them $10 , 000 dollars to have sex with his good looking wife . 

they are taken to the airport where they fly to las vegas to "" do her "" . 

to them , this is the best day of their lives . 

not only are they going to lose their virginity ( one of their lifelong aims ) , but most importantly , they will have enough money to buy a big screen tv . 

inevitably they become caught up in a huge crime , and unbeknown to them , are tracked across the country by the fbi . 

oddly enough , it is their complete stupidity that spares them from being caught , as a result the fbi is convinced they are criminal masterminds . 

they end up travelling right across america , visiting places such as the hoover dam and washington dc . 

the irony is that although they visit so many grand and spectacular locations , their one time out in the big world away from their television , they are completely oblivious to it . 

at old faithful they are far more fascinated with the infra-red operated urinals than with the geyser itself . 

beavis & butt-head essentially have the journey of their lives . 

they even get to meet the president . 

but all they care about is getting their television back , and losing their virginity . 

this is one of the many reasons that the film is so funny - it's unbelievable just how stupid they are , and how they can be so oblivious to everything around them . 

the humour is certainly crude , but then beavis & butt-head are just that ; crude , lude and rude . 

in the end you can't help but feel sorry for them , a pair of anti-social couch potatoes whose life is television . 

in this respect , and also with regard to authority ( such as the fbi ) mike judge is quite critical of amercian society . 

if you are easily offended , or find this pair particularly annoying , steer clear . 

otherwise , it should keep you laughing the whole way through . 

one note of warning : don't take friends who like to imitate beavis & butt-head . . . . . you'll 

never hear the end of it !

"this "" dumb "" cowboy blondie who thinks he is a `darn' good loverboy , decides to leave his dusty ol' town somewhere in texas and go to new york . 

he puts on his beloved cowboy attire and off he hops on the next new york coach . 

when he arrives to new york , he immediately sets out to play mr playboy thinking he is the best `darn' `stud' in the whol'o' new york city . 

obviously he fails . 

he meets the 'cripple' rico ( dustin hoffman , who is terrifically good ) in a bar . 

rico has a leg that is paralysed from the knee down , so he walks in a peculiar way . 

rico is a thief and wants to get some money off this 'rich' dumb cowboy . 

he cheats our cowboy out of $20 through a somewhat detailed routine and disappears . 

soon , our cowboy runs out of money : he gets kicked out of his hotel , and starts getting hungry . 

walking through the city , with "" everybody's talkin' "" playing in the background ( oh , and his prided techno transistor radio in hand ) , he spots rico in a cafe . 

rico , half-scared , pours out all the money in his pocket . 

60 filthy cents . 

our cowboy , hungry , is forgiving . 

he is glad he found someone he knows . 

rico offers to make it up for him . 

and he invites him to his place . 

and what a filthy , cold place it is . 

our cowboy falls asleep instantly in the ( junk ) bed . 

when he finally wakes ( jumps ? ) 

up , he finds rico looking at him . 

 "" you wanna cup'a'coffee ? "" 

rico asks in his friendly , sleazy , somewhat-childish manner while he smokes on a ciggy . 

 "" what're you ? 

a goddamn faggot ? 

what do you want from me ? 

where are my shoes ? 

what did you do to them ? "" 

but all his doubts turn out to be unfounded . 

rico really has a heart . 

together , they live in the junk apartment and almost freeze to death . 

rico is convinced that the best place to be is florida , where the sun shines beautifully and there are lots of coconut trees . 

but he falls sick and is convinced that his cure is to go to florida . 

 "" we will soon be in miami "" is the last sentence uttered in this film and what a shocking , moving end of a film it is . 

the classic theme music : "" midnight cowboy "" helps bring about the feeling of attachment that most viewers will experience towards the end of the film . 

whether the attachment is to the two main characters or to their dreams , is probably as debatable as whether it was the acting or the direction that makes this film so memorable . 
"
"preposterous religious action film ( produced by the trinity broadcasting network ) about a code hidden within the text of the bible that when deciphered will lead to the end of the world ( nice of those bible authors to put a doomsday code into the most read book ever eh ? ) . 

michael york plays a millionaire diplomat who breaks the code and sets out to become god on earth and fulfill the doomsday prophecies , while casper van dien ( terribly miscast and giving an awful performance as a result ) plays the atheist motivational speaker who must stop him . 

michael ironside ( great as always , despite the silly film surrounding him ) plays a fallen priest and right hand man to michael york's character . 

here's some subtle character development you may have missed pertaining to ironside's character . 

now despite the fact that we see him murder a man in the opening scene , the filmmakers aren't quite sure if their audience will understand that he is evil . 

how do they fix that ? 

make specific efforts to show that his character is the only one in the film who smokes ! 

there are lots of ominous shots of michael ironside smoking . . . 

oooooo scary . 

but even that wasn't enough for the filmmakers apparently , as they later have to infer that ironside's character is gay ! 

it comes out of nowhere and just makes no sense . 

my main problem with this film is that , despite the silly story ( which could have been pulled off . . . 

anything can be made believable if executed correctly ) , the events of the film aren't shown with any sense of urgency or importance . 

for example , at one point york's character is declared chancellor of the world or something , and we see one brief , cheesy news report about it . 

the movie keeps telling us that the apocalypse is coming , but it never seems that way . 

there's no "" world reaction "" to anything . 

the omega code is available on dvd from goodtimes home video . 

it contains the film in the original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , and includes the original theatrical trailer , a documentary on the making of the film , production notes , and cast and crew information . 

the documentary runs about 25 minutes and is actually surprisingly good ( it looks as though it was made for broadcast on tbn ) , and it does a comprehensive job of interviewing practically everyone in the cast and crew ( with the exception of michael ironside , unfortunately ) . 

the best thing about it is that whenever crew members are interviewed , they do an excellent job of explaining their profession and exactly what it is they do on a movie set . 

most documentaries tend to overlook this . 

doomsday expert hal lindsey is even interviewed ( you'll remember his documentary from the 1970's called the late great planet earth , where lindsey speculated that jimmy carter might actually be the antichrist ) . 

however , at the very beginning of the documentary the producers of the film managed to get on my bad side . 

when interviewed they actually have the nerve to say "" ever see raiders of the lost ark ? 

well , our film is like that ! "" 

no it isn't . 

not by a long shot .

"dark city is such a rare treat : it ? s a stunning , hyperkinetic vision of a place where our reality is fused with noir , science fiction and the darkest nights in manhattan and london . 

to boot , it is accompanied by an intense , well written and thoughtful story . 

movies of this caliber and idea aren ? t made too often , and it ? s unfortunate that i waited this long to see it . 

alex proyas , who ? s previous film the crow looked good but couldn ? t cover up the terrible acting or story , here shows a near masterpiece ; a combination of metropolis , edward hopper and phillip marlowe , fused seemlessly . 

at times it moves beyond film into artwork . 

it is the story of ? strangers ? , aliens from another planet ( and we know they ? re aliens because they shave their heads and wear overcoats ? one of the detractions of the film ) who experiment on humans to discover what makes them live , what makes up our ? soul ? . 

these aliens are superior to humans because they have mastered the ? ultimate technology ? of shaping matter with their mind , called ? tuning . 

they are aided by a human scientist , played by kiefer sutherland , who has ? betrayed his kind ? and at the start of the film watches as the entire city stops at exactly midnight . 

during this time , john murdoch , played swiftly by rufus sewell , wakes in a bathtub in a room with a swinging overhead light ( a terrific visual effect - not only is murdoch confused , but so is the audience ) . 

without a memory and a strange guilt that he may be a killer , he receives a phone call to flee , as the strangers are after him . 

i don ? t want to proceed to much further with the explanation of the story ; one of the pleasures of the film is watching it develop , in a way regaining murdoch ? s ? identity ? along with him . 

it ? s a pleasure to watch the characters develop through the cinematography . 

murdoch ? s wife , anna , is introduced through a stunning beam of light : she is a lounge singer who sings into a bright spotlight . 

shadows , outlines of men in hats watch , as she gently curves through the shine . 

we see the outline of her body from behind , an hourglass , as she sings a slow , rhythmic song . 

a great entrance . 

however , a film such as this is only successful if the morals and themes behind it are strong enough to leave the viewer satisfied . 

the city is nice to look at , but if it ? s a poor story then it ? s not worth watching . 

blade runner was popular not only because it ? s visuals , but it ? s story and themes were thought out and provoked strong response from the audience . 

it is discussed it and argued , therefore a success . 

other science fiction films of recent times , such as the fifth element , are nice to look at , but are dropped and forgotten because the cookie cutter moral behind them is so flimsy . 

we ? re left with ? love conquers all ? after finishing the fifth element . 

dark city is not so easily explained away . 

as the strangers discovered , locating the human soul and discovering what makes us survive is not such an easy task . 

where is reality ? 

dark city is certainly the best science fiction film of the 90 ? s , and ranks along with the best made in the 80s , such as blade runner and the two aliens films . 

perhaps it ? s the best of the both decades ; it had the darkness of the aliens films , as well as the visuals and compelling story of blade runner , but moved beyond , i think , because the themes behind it were much stronger . 

anyone who wants to make an argument for better science fiction films please feel free to write , i ? d love to hear it . 
"
"it happens every year -- the days get longer , the weather gets warmer and the studios start releasing their big-budget blockbusters . 

this year's crop already seems inferior to that of past summers , even 1997's lackluster trio of batman & robin , the fifth element and the lost world . 

the marketing blitz in 1998 has been centered on godzilla ( "" heeere , lee-zerd , lee-zerd . . . "" ) , which doesn't make me optimistic about future summers . 

godzilla is , of course , based on a series of cult movies ( translation : really bad movies only a few people can tolerate ) from japan that turn up really late at night on ted turner-owned cable stations . 

that this big-budget remake won't rise above its roots is fairly obvious . 

the credits show us the origin of godzilla . 

in five words : nuclear explosion creates giant lizard . 

sounds like an enquirer headline , doesn't it ? 

the mushroom cloud is followed by the inevitable "" discovery "" sequence . 

this time , a japanese guy is eating noodles with chopsticks while watching sumo wrestling ( if that ain't a stereotype . . . ) 

when he discovers the telltale radar blip . 

people die . 

cut to our protagonist , played by matthew broderick . 

he makes his first appearance wearing headphones , warbling along to "" singin' in the rain . "" 

it's a none-too-subtle sign that he wishes he were in a classier movie . 

no dice , bueller . 

from the beginning , poor matthew has to do embarassing things like fondle giant earthworms and stand in godzilla's enormous footprint . 

every disaster movie has to have a know-it-all scientist , and this time broderick is it . 

as the world's leading expert on radiated earthworms ( and wouldn't you love to have that printed on your business card ? ) , 

broderick is invaluable to the government . 

he immediately dispels vicki lewis' theory that godzilla is a dinosaur because , hey , you can't take seriously the intellectual arguments of "" newsradio "" cast members . 

broderick instead hits the nail on the head , announcing godzilla is a radiated lizard . 

 "" the radiation isn't an anamoly , "" he announces , and lightning strikes . 

 "" i believe this is a mutated abberation , "" he continues , and lightning strikes again . 

it's vocabulary lightning , you see , activated by words of four syllables or more . 

meanwhile , we're introduced to our new york cast , headed by an ambitious broadcast journalist ( maria patillo ) , broderick's former love . 

gee , what are the odds their paths will cross again at a dramatically important time ? 

poor patillo has been trying to get ahead in the news business for years but has been held down by heartless anchorman harry shearer . 

italian cameraman hank azaria tells her she's not ruthless enough : "" nice doesn't get you anywhere in this town . 

it's dog eat dog . "" 

actually , it's lizard eat city , as godzilla emerges from the atlantic to begin a rampage on the big apple's core . 

the filmmakers provide us with a one-note drunk fisherman who hooks godzilla . 

 "" i think i've got a bite , "" he announces as a gigantic tidal wave begins rushing toward him . 

you can guess what happens next . 

similar reactions spring forth as the monster prowls the city . 

hearing the rumble of approaching footsteps , one new yorker remarks , "" please don't tell me that's another parade . "" 

please don't tell me that's the best line you could come up with . 

mayor ebert is not pleased . 

played by the principal from "" head of the class , "" he continually makes the wrong decision when given an option , and bickers with his assistant gene . 

i guess the filmmakers knew they'd be getting two thumbs down from the critics and didn't even bother to kiss ass . 

the problem is , if you're going to attack siskel and ebert , you should at least make it funny . 

dialogue like , "" didn't we agree that we weren't going to have any sweets until after the election ? "" 

followed by , "" back off , gene , "" just doesn't work for me . 

other lame running jokes include everyone mispronouncing the broderick character's last name and frenchman jean reno's inability to find a good cup of coffee in new york . 

there's even more fun to be had as godzilla progresses . 

as the beast heads back into hiding , broderick suggests the military lure it out with food . 

cue twelve dump trucks , all dropping fish into a new york intersection . 

 ( broderick : that's a lot of fish . ) 

that ambush fails , but broderick soon figures out why godzilla came to new york by buying $50 worth of home pregnancy tests and running lizard blood through them . 

yep , godzilla's with children , which makes you wonder just what kind of creature would be horny enough to have sex with godzilla . 

that's until broderick explains that godzilla reproduces asexually , like linda tripp . 

godzilla comes to us from the makers of independence day , so it has a lot of dumb action scenes , destructive special effects and shallow subplots . 

look no further than patillo's betrayal of broderick ( patillo : what have i done , animal ? 

what have i become ? ) and the climactic "" godzilla's nest "" sequence in madison square garden . 

the main difference is , independence day was about the experience . 

it had a real global , patriotic element to it , and some genuinely fun characters . 

godzilla has lots of rain and lightning , reptilian action ripped off from jurassic park and endless product placement from the likes of kodak , blockbuster , juicy fruit , swatch , sprint and bumble bee tuna . 

yes , bumble bee actually paid to be known as the official tuna of godzilla . 

that fact alone is twice as interesting as anything in the movie . 
"
"one of these days , i'll make good on my promise never to rent another abel ferrara movie . 

king of new york and body snatchers notwithstanding ( and bad lieutenant is only fit for a single , emotive viewing ) , his exploitation flicks have fallen into a rut of hoary art-house trappings . 

it's a perfume-drenched , coke-addled visit to the seedy pornography shop , where beautiful models ( no , hookers -- no , courtesans ) usher you through the silk curtains . 

ferrara's only consistently smart move has been casting christopher walken over and over again , since walken can make a good movie great and a loathsome movie durable whenever he's onscreen . 

his 8-minute scene in the addiction is the saving grace of that otherwise abysmal , unwatchable , and pretentious failure . 

when he starts talking about his vampiric bowel movements , or questions whether lili taylor has ever read naked lunch , there's a much-needed dose of humor in an otherwise terminally unfunny affair . 

you know those gothic club kids who are too cool to smile and let you know they're actually having fun ? 

the addiction is that movie . 

walken , sadly , does not appear in the blackout . 

the central role of matty , a junkie film star whose lightning paced hollywood life among the beautiful people is inevitably leading to his destruction , is played by matthew modine ( who takes what he can get after cutthroat island ) . 

much like the protagonists of michelangelo antonioni's terminally bored cultural elite , matty is involved in a bitter pill "" relationship "" with high fashioned model annie ( at least i think she's a model . ) 

matty's lady is played by french actress b ? atrice dalle , arrested twice for cocaine possession during filming of the blackout -- not that you needed to know that , but it lends credence to the idea that ferrara's entire oeuvre has been filmed in a fucking blackout . 

no kidding . 

requiem for a dream has nothing on the junkie presentations seen in ferrara's movies and his controversial urban lifestyle . 

matty and annie struggle over her decision to have an abortion without consulting him . 

no doubt , he was off chasing the dragon . 

in his despair , matty indulges in a chemical induced weekend of debauchery , tooling around the streets of miami with video filmmaker mickey wayne ( dennis hopper , in full "" dirty ol' man "" mold smacking models on the ass and telling them to spread their legs . 

wider ! ) 

toward the end of the night , they pick up a teenage waitress also named annie ( sarah lassez ) , start shooting a hastily improvised sexual scene , then matty thankfully blacks out . 

something happened that night which haunts him throughout the rest of the movie , and it's exactly what you think it was . 

suffice to say , there's some confusion over whether he killed annie one or annie two , or anyone at all . 

the blackout is typical ferrara : no plot to speak of , plenty of raunch , and horribly vogue images of matthew modine downing a bottle of jack daniels and a beer while wrapping himself in a see-through curtain in his hotel room by the sea , by the sea , by the beautiful sea . 

cinematographer ken kelsch finds inconsistent glory in alternating gorgeous painterly sunsets with docu-style sleaze ( and we're back to dennis hopper leering at girls in bathing suits . 

 "" yeah ! ! ! 

yeah ! ! ! 

arrrghhh ! "" 

says mr . hopper . 

dirty old sod . ) 

it's compulsive viewing in a tacky sort of way , leading to a ridiculous climax where modine seizes control of his destiny . 

how's that for cryptic ? 

never fear -- ferrara finds time for some female full frontal nudity to remind us what he's all about . 

i can picture it now . 

 "" take off yer clothes , kid -- it's essential to depict the inner maelstrom of my central protagonist , and you're his visual id . 

you're the soul , the heart , the bloodstream of the picture . 

take it off ! 

take it all off ! ! ! 

ha ha ha ! "" 

friggin' vampire . 

yeah , you , ferrara . 

a final word about matthew modine : he's actually a fine actor when properly cast , but there's something too squeaky-clean in his demeanor . 

he's ideally suited for sarcastic men in tightly controlled situations , such as his private joker in full metal jacket or the time-bomb nebbish in short cuts ( who is every bit as superb as julianne moore in that famous scene , though no one seems to notice him ) . 

[he was in that scene ? 

-ed . ] 

here , he's asked to let it all hang out , sporting a three-day stubble and oily bangs . 

he throws around furniture like stanley kowalski , but it's somehow lacking . 

modine lacks the feral intensity of brando , entirely miscast in ferrara's flesh fair . 

better luck next time , matt . 

someday , you'll be forgiven for cutthroat island , which wasn't really your fault in the first place . 

maybe atom egoyan will find a place for you somewhere , and all will once again be well in your world .

"synopsis : back-up quarterback moxxon becomes starting quarterback midway through his senior year of high school , even though he'd rather read "" slaughterhouse five "" than the playbook . 

evil football coach kilmer throws away moxxon's book , though , while the evil team physician injects painkillers into the players . 

in the meantime , moxxon's kid brother forms a cult , and a bubblegum-blond cheerleader smears whip cream on herself to seduce the new star quarterback . 

comments : since i usually review horror and science fiction films , i feel a little out of my league discussing this teen football movie . 

 ( pun intended . 

thank you ! ) 

varsity blues was produced by mtv , and it really shows . 

several extended scenes allow for a continual soundtrack of mediocre pop songs meant to appeal to the adolescent male audience this crap was intended for . 

the teenagers all have reasons for their melodramatic angst . 

the adults all have problems , of course , and , as one-dimensional characters , they are all fanatically obssessed with how their local high school football team performs . 

yes , this movie represents high school life in mtv-land . 

this is a land where your health teacher is also a part-time stripper , your ice cream store attendant girlfriend wears an egyptian ankh around her neck , your kid brother forms a "" cute "" cult , your football coach is an uncaring , obssessive madman , and your friends' lives consist of nothing but getting laid and driving around in cop cars naked . 

all you , as the main character , want to do , however , is read "" slaughterhouse five "" and attend brown university in the fall . 

well , at least this is a little more realistic than mtv's "" the real world . "" 

varsity blues stars james van der beek , this week's teen tv star making the leap to the big screen . 

he plays the hick moxxon adequately , though some of his emotional dialogue will make people chuckle . 

 ( "" you dawn't own mah life ! "" 

who would want to ? ) 

jon voight , the stock evil guy in countless other movies , is , surprise , the stock evil guy here . 

but is he really evil , or is he a product of society ? 

after all , everybody , young and old , in this movie has no life whatsoever and do nothing but obssess over high school football . 

maybe the pressures of the 90 screaming fans at the football field drove evil coach kilmer evil . 

the film's screenplay never answers this burning question . 

at times , iliff's story does show glimmers of touching or humorous scenes , but , before the audience gets their hopes up that there might be something redeeming in this movie , they get trashed with another lengthy party sequence or overwrought football game . 

the movie's pacing is slow , and the plot turns are mindnumbingly obvious from start to finish . 

i suppose i'm being a little hard on varsity blues . 

maybe i'm just a little miffed that i had to pay 3 bucks to see it , even though it was dollar night at the cinema . 

something about a request from the studio made the theater charge more money . 

i found the film oftentimes ludicrous and boring . 

three guys in front of us smuggled beer into the the theater . 

i wished i had thought of that . 

alcohol , lots of it , may have helped the viewing experience .

"one of the most respected names in american independent filmmaking is john sayles . 

he has built a strong reputation with films like matewan and the secret of roan inish , and one of his best was his last film , lone star . 

after sayles gave us this complex and unconventional look at ethnic tensions on the us-mexico border , expectation ran high for his next film . 

unfortunately , his men with guns is not the film anyone was hoping for . 

we are essentially told in the first reel where the film is going to go and what it is going to do . 

then the film does exactly what it promised , a painful as that is . 

the plot of men with guns can be summarized "" in a central or south american country things are really bad for everybody in the mountains where the army clashes with the guerrillas . 

dr . fuentes did not believe how bad things were so he went . 

and he found out again and again and again . "" 

of course it is perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into a living hell . 

a guerrilla war is always bad for civilians . 

but the film talks down to the viewer . 

dr . fuentes ( played by federico luppi ) teaches medicine in the capital city of his country . 

he has , as a great humanitarian gesture , trained and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains and make the world a little better for the poor indios . 

fuentes believe the students to be up there doing humanitarian service . 

then he discovers one of his best students has instead returned to the city and runs a squalid private pharmacy . 

in shame and disappointment fuentes asks the student what has happened to the others . 

the student tells him the others are still in the mountains , but suggests that it may not be a good place to be . 

fuentes goes off to find and visit the doctors , ignoring the advice of his family and a patient who happens to be an army general . 

the results are little different than one would expect . 

dr . fuentes starts out incredibly naive . 

even some american tourists , present in the film mostly for comic relief , seem to know better than dr . fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains . 

but fuentes has to go from one scene of barbarity to another and discover how wrong he was . 

sayles certainly could have used 126 minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than that nasty things are happening down there and most of the worst happens to the unarmed civilians . 

the cast is mostly unknowns to american audiences . 

federico luppi is the good mexican actor who played the antique dealer torn by mysterious forces in cronos . 

damian delgado makes a late appearance as an army deserter . 

mandy patinkin has a small role made to look bigger in the trailer .

"one of the first films of 1999 is this mtv pictures release which marks the first leading feature role for james van der beek , the star of the wb's runaway hit dawson's creek . 

following in the foot steps of mtv's two other live action films , joe's apartment ( 1996 ) and dead man on campus ( 1998 ) , varsity blues is a bad film and is unlikely to cause much of a sensation in the marketplace . 

set in west cannan , texas , the film examines the small town obsession with high school football through the eyes of second string quarterback john "" mox "" moxon ( van der beek ) . 

we know he's smart because he reads kurt vonnegut instead of the playbook . 

coach bud kilmer ( jon voight ) has been around so long there is actually a bronze statue commemorating him . 

the star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , is a handsome , blonde , hero who has his own billboard in his front yard and dates the sexy head cheerleader , darcy ( ali larter ) . 

also on the team are an enormous guy ( ron lester ) with some health problems and the token african-american team member ( eliel swinton ) whose only real dialogue scene deals directly with the color of his skin . 

when lance is seriously injured , mox gets his chance to shine and he runs with it , undermining kilmer with his unusual playing strategies . 

his relationship with his dutiful girlfriend , jules ( amy smart ) , is threatened and there's a big game at the end . 

guess who wins ? 

nothing about varsity blues is inspired and the whole film simply moves through the sort of conventional motions that coach kilmer would love . 

there's a chance for some smart satire on small town obsessions but the humor here is decidedly lowbrow . 

van der beek does a decent job of carrying his first film although a silly accent trips him up sometimes . 

also , the role isn't very much of a stretch from his dawson leary character . 

he's still a pseudo-intellectual , whiny , nice guy , except here he also happens to be a jock . 

voight is a terror as he chews up every single piece of scenery and spits it out . 

the other adults are all notably awful while the younger performers don't fare much better . 

on the positive side , walker is a charismatic actor who is due for a breakout role following this and his supporting turn in pleasantville ( 1998 ) . 

scott ( son of james ) caan has some lively moments as tweeder , the team's wild man . 

larter , as a gorgeous seductress looking for a one way ticket out of texas , gets to show off the film's most interesting costumes , including a very eye-opening "" whipped cream bikini . "" 

it's interesting to note that the film definitely earns its r-rating with a lot of harsh language , alcohol abuse and an unusually high amount of nudity ( including a gratuitous trip to a strip bar that reveals a not very surprising surprise ) . 

all this is likely to come as a shock to the young female fan base of dawson's creek , presumably the target audience for the picture . 

director brian robbins previously helmed the kids feature good burger ( from nickelodeon films , a sister company of mtv ) and changes directions here a bit but still fails to make much of an impression . 

the look of the movie is as bland as the town and characters who populate it . 

the football scenes are generally unexciting and the entire film looks a bit washed out . 

there's an ok soundtrack featuring music from collective soul , foo fighters , green day and aaliyah but it's not as impressive as one would expect from a mtv film .

"it's a rare treat when a quality horror film is released in the theater . 

and unfortunately with man's best friend , we'll be waiting a while longer . 

the film stars ally sheedy and lance henrikson in a tale of bio-genetics gone wrong . 

sheedy plays a nosy reporter whose need for a "" good "" story provokes her to snoop inside of emax , a poorly guarded million dollar bio-lab that she finds herself effortlessly intruding . 

the result : she unleashes the experimental wonder dog named max , a german shepherd with genetic recombination allowing it to swallow like a snake , camouflage like a chameleon , climb trees like a leopard , and attack with the strength of tiger . 

max takes a liking to sheedy , and she finds herself protecting the animal from the cruel technological realm of emax , owned by henrikson . 

well , it doesn't take long before the hormonally unstable biohazard unleashes his jowls upon the unsuspecting suburban landscape which offers max juicy leg of mailman , etc . . . 

sheedy is a boring non-presence on the screen , tripping through the enormous plot chasms neglected by the writer/director ( i apologize for a lack of credits . 

i suppose i was eager to leave the theater , and in my rush , forgot to take note of the director , writer , producer , etc . . . ) . 

henrikson offered the only relief from the contrived narration of the script , giving his character as much development as he could considering the flat dialogue plaguing the film . 

the movie depends upon it's ability to impress the audience with animal special effects , but all it presents is a dog that can growl , open door handles with his paw , sit , roll over , play dead , and sick . 

the rest of the special effects were so poor , i found them offensive . 

the film attains sub-mediocrity , an unambitious film at best . 

horror fans might find that cujo offers a better bite .

"when andy leaves for cowboy camp , his mother holds a yard sale and scrounges in his room for old toys . 

one of these toys is wheezy , a penguin with a broken squeaker . 

woody ( tom hanks ) saddles up andy's dog and rides out into the yard to rescue wheezy . 

woody succeeds in his mission , but doesn't make it back to the house before al , the unscrupulous owner of al's toy barn , recognizes woody as a rare collector's item and steals him . 

buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) leads hamm ( john ratzenberger ) , mr . potato head ( don rickles ) , slinky dog ( jim varney ) , and rex ( wallace shawn ) into the city to find their friend . 

meanwhile woody discovers the reason he was kidnapped . 

al has collected every piece of merchandising from the 1950's tv puppet show "" woody's round-up "" except for a woody doll . 

now that the collection is complete , al plans to sell woody and his round-up gang-bullseye the horse , jessie the cowgirl ( joan cusack ) , and stinky pete the old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) -to a toy museum in japan . 

the gang is happy about the move ; they've been in storage for years waiting for woody . 

if woody doesn't go with them , they'll be closed up in a dark box again , possibly forever . 

trying to convince him to stay with them , jessie tells woody how she was abandoned when her owner grew up , and woody realizes that his days as a beloved toy are numbered . 

while woody ponders whether to go to japan or to go home to andy , buzz and the boys invade al's toy barn , where the buzz we know is replaced by another buzz who doesn't know he's a toy . 

the new buzz generates the movie's biggest laughs as he leads the other toys in an assault on "" zurg's fortress "" ( i . e . , al's apartment building ) . 

the original "" toy story "" won me over because its central themes reflected a grown-up sensibility rather than the usual this-is-what-we-think-kids-want-to-hear . 

while most kids' movies take the position that every person is special and has an extraordinary destiny to fulfill , in "" toy story "" buzz discovered that he wasn't special , that he was just like everyone else . 

buzz sank into a suicidal depression , but woody showed buzz that being a toy was worthwhile because a toy is loved and a toy makes a child happy . 

in other words , it's okay to be ordinary if you have love and a purpose in your life . 

most of us probably come to the same conclusion when we realize that we're not space rangers and we're never going to be . 

 "" toy story 2 "" addresses the question raised by the conclusion drawn by the first movie . 

woody is forced to recognize that andy will grow up and forget him and that he will likely be discarded , abandoned , or sealed up in a dark box in the attic . 

this is another big grown-up theme : everything ends . 

the theme is introduced early in the movie when woody's arm is torn and andy places him on a shelf rather than taking him to cowboy camp . 

on the shelf , woody meets wheezy , who's dusty , broken , and forgotten . 

the other toys are shocked that woody has been "" shelved , "" and they worry that woody's ride out to the 25-cent box at the yard sale is a suicide attempt . 

after he's stolen , woody has to decide between a long life in a display case and an uncertain future with andy and his pals . 

of course , in spite of the heavy themes "" toy story 2 "" explores , it's also very funny . 

most of the laughs come from the toys' assault on al's toy barn and on the apartment building . 

the brief substitution of a new , still delusional buzz was a welcome surprise ; i'd wondered how a sequel could be as funny as the original without the pompous attitude buzz displayed in the original . 

most of the vocal performances are first-rate . 

tom hanks stands out for the level of enthusiasm he puts into his work . 

however , one voice-over also stands out as horribly miscast . 

kelsey grammer sounds nothing like an old prospector . 

although he does a lot of voice-over work in commercials and on "" the simpsons "" ( as sideshow bob ) , grammer only makes slight variations on his own voice . 

he doesn't have the range to pull off a role like stinky pete . 

the animation is even better than in the first . 

especially impressive were the textures of the figures . 

we can now see the difference between flesh and plastic ; in the first movie the people looked just like the toys , but now human skin looks soft and has a slight bluish tint . 

we can also see that bo peep is porcelain . 

as you can tell from the long-winded phrasing common in the merchandising -- "" disney and pixar's 'toy story 2' "" -- this is pixar's coming out party . 

to celebrate they appended their first project , a hilarious short about two desklamps and a rubber ball , to the beginning of the movie . 

they made the short in 1986 , which is incredible when one considers the relatively primitive level of computer technology available then . 

on the downside , "" toy story 2 "" follows the formula of the original so closely that the sequel comes off a bit stale , and some sections tend to drag . 

overall , though , i had a great time and found "" story 2 "" to be a worthy successor to the first "" toy story . "" 

bottom line : this one really is fun for the whole family !

"here is a movie that sadly follows the hong kong-recipe of moviemaking and storytelling to the letter . 

these kinds of movies are marked by an eye-opening sequence that introduces us to the main characters ; a life-and-death plot in which these characters become involved ; the inclusion of a host of inconsequential characters ; ridiculous subplots , and sunglass-wearing henchmen . 

that is not to say that i don't like hong kong influenced movies ; however , it is quite obvious that these moviemakers haven't a clue that the american filmgoer needs more than hip-hop-talking thugs and stupid sight gags . 

observe the opening sequence . 

a band of hitmen are about to storm an apartment , led by melvin ( mark wahlberg ) and cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) . 

they are waiting for their partner to cut off the power so that they can storm the apartment with the help of infrared goggles . 

however , their partner is unsure of which cable to cut . 

he is undecided . 

this happens for about 10 seconds . 

the audience finds some humor in his foolishness . 

the lights suddenly go out . 

cisco is surprised and says : "" whoa . . . let's 

go ! "" 

and they storm the apartment in a very nicely executed sequence . 

the big hit of the title refers to a kidnapping that happens a quarter of the way through the film . 

needing cash , cisco devises a plan to kidnap the daughter ( china chow ) of wealthy japanese industrialist jiro nishi . 

however , the daughter is also the god-daughter of paris ( avery brooks ) , who is cisco's and melvin's boss . 

infuriated and insufferable , paris commands cisco to uncover the mastermind of the kidnapping . 

during his 'investigation' , cisco singles out melvin as the ringleader , and paris orders his capture and execution . 

melvin must now find a way to stay alive . 

by the way , do you know how the investigation takes place ? 

cisco's partner makes the ransom phone call believing that his call will not be traced because of a trace buster that prevents tracing . 

but , mr . nishi has a trace buster buster . 

to counter that , cisco's partner has a trace buster buster buster . 

but nishi has a trace buster buster buster buster . 

and so on . . . 

there is no doubt that this is an interesting world in which they live . 

and there are lots of issues that we'd like to know more about . 

how does melvin justify his profession to his fiancee ? 

what goes on among this clique ? 

why is cisco at odds with melvin ? 

there is actually a lot of potential material that could have been explored , but it seems that no effort is made to go in that direction , and instead we are given a not-so-engrossing plot filled with one-liners , silly sight gags , extraneous sub-plots and tomfoolery . 

and , i haven't even mentioned his financee's visiting parents who want them to separate , nor melvin's mistress , nor the pimple-faced video clerk demanding the return of an overdue video and on and on and on . 

if the big hit signals the future of hong kong style movies that are made for american audiences , then shoot me now . 
"
"it's been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller , where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters , but it's been even longer since i saw a thriller that actually * shock * cared for the characters , not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles , flaws , and strengths to emerge so radiantly . 

i'd saw that it's been at least a couple decades , even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers , though i'm hardly comparing "" a simple plan "" to , say , "" rear window "" or "" strangers on a train . "" 

yet it's almost as good . 

it's simple , yet strangely complex , and astonishingly rewarding , because instead of moving from plot point to plot point , and merely laying out they-might-be-caught overtones , it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to , all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral . 

elegantly directed by sam raimi ( yes , the same ) , "" a simple plan "" concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright , moderately financially stable working man ( bill paxton ) , his dim-witted brother ( billy bob thornton ) , and his drinking buddy ( brent briscoe ) . 

without anyone around , and the possibility that no one would come looking for it , the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes , they will keep it , but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking , and so they generally don't flaunt anything they don't want to flaunt , they'll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton . 

the possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse : a ) they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities ; b ) they could try to fight off the rightful owners , who are either villainous or just ; or c ) they could fight amongst themselves . 

 "" a simple plan , "" though borrows a little from each of these . 

a little tiff with the cops here , a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent ( a chilling gary cole ) there ) , and a bit of inside feuding over here . 

but , as austin powers would say , that's not necessarily its bag ( baby ) . 

what i most admired about this film , and what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that it's successfully able to have its cake and eat it too . 

it effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches , like the ones mentioned above , but at the same time , it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag . 

so while steps are taken to neatly cover things up , and these subsequent steps go miserably awry , the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to , they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity . 

in one early scene , paxton and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesn't look like it was all stolen ( not a bad idea ) , when thornton screws up ( as he does continuously throughout the movie ) , and paxton has to do some major covering-up ( read : homicide ) . 

instead of a quick murder and immeadiate hands-washing , raimi shows a lengthy , painful shot from a low-angle onto paxton's face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach a conclusion . 

there's a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he's committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective , but the previous shot is even better : more morally complex and more gut-wrenching . 

in short , probably the best piece of direction raimi's ever done , demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results ( for further proof , watch "" persona "" 's "" sex scene "" and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergman's ever done ) . 

but the film hardly stops here ; it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof . 

yet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story . 

when the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical ( with aid from his pregnant wife , played by bridget fonda , a pal to raimi ) , he does , and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights . 

there's at least two grand shootouts , and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history , and when they arrive , they don't come with masochistic delight but with cringe-inducing horror . 

during the one , i was actually sinking into my chair , with the mantra "" they can't do this , can they ? "" 

streeming through my head . 

in fact , this film , which is getting many comparisons to the coen's [superior , but forget about it] "" fargo , "" has many similar moments of manic insanity , attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what , in other hands , would be over-the-top distractedness ( imagine , i suppose , robert rodriguez directing this . . . then 

again , after seeing the "" evil dead "" films , i'd hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off , although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed "" raimi "" moments , a rifle-shot notwithstanding ) . 

instead , raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch , easily letting the story and characters co-exist , while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out , like some offbeat comic touches . 

most particularly , billy bob thornton's character , jacob , is a brilliant creation . 

his dim-wittedness is often hilarious ( for most of the film , every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter ) , but there's authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that we're not totally laughing at him . 

the chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of full-condescension because thornton is so damn real . 

jacob's a multi-dimensional character , and while being stupid , we see that as not so much a flaw , but a strength to his character : his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of a strong inner strength and belief system , primarily towards the middle where his bud and co-conspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money . 

the final third of the film spends much time with him , and many of the touches upon his character , not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott b . smith ( adapting his own book , by the way ) are just great . 

i particularly admired a back story about an old high school girlfriend , told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to near-sweetness and further strength of his saddened character . 

thornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance , by far the best performance he's ever given and further proof that he's the best character actor in contemporary cinema ( if you don't believe me , go back and watch his wonderful performance in "" primary colors , "" a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadn't been in the same year ) because he's easily able to slip into a character , and make him completely and utterly believable . 

he brings so much weight to the film that , as it is with most character actors , it's difficult picturing anyone else in the role . 

the rest of the cast is great too , from paxton's declining working man to chelcie ross' amiable town sheriff . 

even fonda shows off her talents nicely . 

and if i had any complaints about the film , it's that the plot is almost too simplistic , and that at times , it seems too much like an exercise , like a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved . 

and the occasional narration is , as it usually is , annoying ( narration should be used with extreme caution , especially when you're trying to set things up and/or express emotions - didn't raimi watch the first murder scene ? ) . 

and , the thing that can most usually go wrong with a movie , the ending is basically amiss . 

i won't reveal it , but it's way too cruel and too much of an outsider set-up , as if the appearance of a plane wasn't already too much of that anyway . 

for a film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved , this is the wrong ending . 

imagine a character-controlled ending ; otherwise , it's like if in "" crime and punishment "" if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing . . . not that i'm at all comparing "" a simple plan "" to dostoevsky . 

the ending does work , despite my protestations , but to me , there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it ; but if you had no qualms and were happy as a clam with it , then just ignore me and go about your day . 

but despite my mere claims , make no mistake that i was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout , and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured , not because of any kind of gore factor ( which is , thankfully for this , very minimal ) , but because the film places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things to overcome that i've frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile . 

at least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece . 
"
"the start of this movie reminded me of parts from the movie stargate . 

people are looking around in an egyptian temple reading about some dangerous thing that is going to destroy earth in the future . 

after a sort of confusing bit involving fake-looking cyborg things , the movie jumps into the future and the movie improves by leaps and bounds . 

the basic idea behind the movie is that every once in a while ( make that every 1000 years or so ) an evil force comes to destroy earth . 

the things needed to defend against this menace are the four elements of nature plus the fifth element . 

the plot in this movie really isn't that important to the thing though . 

this movie has very good special effects , for the most part . 

the techno-ish music in the background fits the mood very well . 

bruce willis is an illegal taxi-cab driver in a futuristic new york city . 

one day a lady draped with a few bandages drops down into his trunk . 

this movie is about what happens . 

the plot twists are interesting and the movie never fails to present the viewer with a variety of different locations . 

also there is a fair bit of action in the film , particularly towards the end . 

some characters are just plain strange including a highly-energetic deejay in drag . 

bruce willis does his normal job of blowing things away like he always does . 

the movie is definitely watchable and rarely slows down . 

it is one of those sci-fi films where you'll be saying "" cool "" followed by a "" what the hell ? ! ? ! "" . 

i give the fifth element . 
"
"in "" gia "" , angelina jolie plays the titular character , the first so-called supermodel . 

and right there you have the biggest hurdle this movie had to overcome ( in my eyes , anyway ) . 

i just don't see how the life of a model is worthy of a two hour film . 

despite this , i kept an open mind when i began watching the movie . 

sadly , though , my fears were realized . 

it's just not possible to make an interesting , full-length film about a person who spends their days wearing different clothes . 

the movie follows the rise and fall of gia ( no last name ) , a tumultuous woman who doesn't particularly enjoy the world of fashion . 

she becomes famous more quickly than she can handle , and finds herself hooked on drugs and on a woman she cannot have . 

the last hour of the film is just one scene after another of gia getting high , losing a job , and going into rehab . 

this formula is repeated several times , and i really got tired of it . 

in general , i tend to dislike movies featuring heavy drug use . 

no because it offends me or anything like that ; it just bores me . 

quite frankly , i don't see the appeal , so when a director shows me a point-of-view shot of a junkie , complete with tipsy camera angles and echoing voices , i am left somewhat unimpressed . 

the first hour of the film , though , was actually quite engaging . 

we see gia as she is discovered and moves to new york with her boyfriend . 

these early scenes were interesting . 

we're shown the fashion world through a newcomers eyes , and it was a perspective i hadn't seen before . 

the movie begins to go downhill , however , once gia becomes an established model . 

>from that point , i lost all interest in the movie and was counting the minutes before it would end . 

it all seemed so excessive . 

fine , so gia had a drug problem , does this really need to dominate the film ? 

couldn't the same effect have been had with a five or ten minute montage of scenes featuring gia experimenting with drugs ? 

or perhaps this film is meant to be a warning to aspiring models not to get into the drug world . 

quite possibly , although since i have no desire to become a model , this warning is lost on me . 

as i stated at the beginning of this review , i simply don't see how the life of a model is worthy of a feature-length motion picture . 

what do they do that warrants a movie ? 

strut their stuff for thousands of dollars an hour ? 

i suppose the same could be said about making movies about baseball players , for example , but at least somebody like lou gehrig led an interesting life . 

gia did not . 

and by the end of the film , all i knew about gia for sure was that she hated modelling , was bi-sexual , and was heavily into drugs . 

not exactly a meaningful contribution to society , as far as i'm concerned .

 "" you feel that there's a and looking directly into errol morris's camera . 

 "" i know you are . 

you know i am . "" 

in some ways the slickest film yet from nonfiction auteur morris ( the thin blue line , a brief history of time ) , fast , cheap & out of control is reportage of the highest order . 

journalism students should dream of making connections like these . 

cross-cutting among interviews and filmed segments , morris traces the lives of four disparate professionals who seem to share nothing but an immersion in their work , and then threads them around one another in an intricate quadruple helix . 

the fun is settling into your theater seat and wondering just what the hell one story can possibly have to do with the other . 

what morris manages is something akin to an intellectual magic trick , an interrogative sleight of hand . 

one of the things that feels different about an errol morris documentary -- besides the always-striking visuals -- is the interview style , where subjects seem to look directly at the viewer . 

weary of pressing his cheek against the camera lens to get this effect during conversations , morris developed an elaborate double-camera gadget he calls , half-jokingly , the interrotron . 

through a rig that uses a pair of teleprompters to project video images of the interviewer for the subject and vice versa , these folks talk , startlingly , right to the camera -- to the video image of morris , and by extension to the audience . 

the gardener wonders whether , after his death , anyone will be interested in maintaining the garden that he's devoted half his life to tending . 

the robot scientist is more than a little pleased to note that his creations may be primal examples of what an insect or even an animal is -- a complicated set of sensory receptors . 

the mole rat specialist is delighted to catalog the ways in which these vermin animals behave like insects , and notes that they may be more suited to long-term survival than people . 

and the circus trainer pines for a long-lost ideal that was exemplified by world-renowned trainer and showman clyde beatty , who starred in such serials as zombies of the stratosphere ( excerpted at some length here , with affection ) . 

starting to detect the patterns ? 

fast , cheap & out of control contains a multitude of parallels and tiny intersections , culminating in what feels like an elegy ( the film is dedicated to morris's late mother and stepfather ) . 

the film is balanced on that airy precipice dividing the already musty past from the alternately exhilarating and terrifying space that is the future . 

 ( the title is taken from brooks' wish that nasa would send a payload of hundreds of expendable robots to scurry about the martian surface , creating a sort of road map for the terrain -- fast , cheap , and out of control . ) 

with able assists from editors karen schmeer and shondra merrill and cinematographer robert richardson ( oliver stone's longtime collaborator ) , this becomes a cinematic contraption that's a wonder of narrative divergence and coherence . 

 ( further enhancing the picture's wacky intellectual mood is the playful score by alloy orchestra founder caleb sampson . ) 

different story threads inform and comment on one another with the serene inscrutability of a kieslowski film , or a surrealist dream . 

by cobbling together out of these motley musings a thesis on the nature of craftsmanship , invention , and existence itself , morris reveals the presence of cosmic themes -- creation , evolution , death -- in earthbound lives . 

at the same time , and just as significantly , he pays tribute to a consuming passion for one's work . 

this breakdown of the dichotomy between the everyday and the extraordinary is likely as profound as anything you'll encounter in pop culture this year , and the visuals cry out for the big screen . 

don't miss it .

[expectations - medium] 

long review =========== 

i must admit being a bit reluctant going into this film . 

i didn't believe that they ( mike myers and dana carvey ) could hold it up for an hour and a half , i figured that perhaps the first half-hour would be great , and the rest would be "" fluff . "" 

however , i was really surprised about how well they were able to keep the laughs going for the virtually the whole film , with the exception of the ending . 

 ( which i won't discuss for obvious reasons , but it's not * that * bad . ) 

story : the plot was quite thin , but it really wasn't that noticeable , because of the rapid-fire jokes that myers wrote in . 

alot of the jokes are very similar to hot shots ! , in being very "" parodyish . "" 

 ( okay , bad term . ) 

extremely witty throughout , although ( as in hot shots ) it got a bit repetitive in the middle . 

acting : as in many comedies , the acting isn't really * that * important . 

however , myers turns in a good performance as wayne , playing the character perfectly , ( although i still liked him better back on much music , in a more "" canadian "" type of mode . ) 

carvey is okay as garth , but he lacks the spark myers puts into wayne . 

tia carrere is mediocre as cassandra , playing it very stilted . 

lowe is fine as ben oliver , but is nothing to write home about . 

without a doubt , this movie is mike myers all the way . 

direction : spheeris is a classic "" music "" movie director , making dudes , and decline of western civilization ii -- the metal years . 

 ( she also directed the boys next door , which is different , to say the least . ) 

she is very capable , knows how direct a comedy , the correct camera movements it instill laughs , etc . one of the better jobs i can remember for a comedy . 

overall : i would suggest to anyone that likes snl's skits to go see this film in the theatres . 

however , my personal opinion , as in most comedies , is that they work just as well on video . 

you definately have to be fan of music , and all forms of media in general to enjoy this film . 

without a doubt , this is the best comedy so far this year . 

it'll make tons 'o' dough for everyone involved . 

let's just hope they make a thousand sequels . 

[sorry , i had to get the lame joke in . . . 

forgive me . ]

"the realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political and or moral sensibilities . 

the best tales of the genre deal with mankind's struggle for survival or knowledge . 

such popular and noteworthy tomes as "" stranger in a strange land "" by robert heinlein , "" childhood's end "" by arthur c . clarke and "" man in the high castle "" and "" do androids dream of electric sheep "" by philip k . dick all deal with man's need for identity and struggle for self worth . 

hollywood has regularly adapted the milieu ( if not the message ) of science fiction since it's beginnings . 

most films just created fancy pulp tales with no more thought that the escapism they achieved . 

it really wasn't until producer george pal , took charge of robert heinlein's novel "" rocketship galileo "" and crafted the film "" destination moon "" , that 'sci-fi' ( as it is commonly referred to ) , came into it's own . 

from there , such diverse filmmakers as roger corman to stanley kubrick , have sought to express ideas through the medium of the genre . 

with the release of touchstone pictures "" mission to mars "" , we have an unabashedly nonchalant sci-fi film for those who read the national enquirer and the globe . 

the film opens on a summer barbecue , as phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) woos a young female with his tales of space glory and the upcoming mission . 

woody blake ( tim robbins ) and his wife terri ( connie nielsen ) commit to his coming authority on the mission , and luc goddard ( don cheadle ) consoles his son . 

entering the party is jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , who gave up command of the mission due to the untimely death of his wife , maggie ( kim delaney ) . 

luc consoles jim with woody's assistance . 

the three men are friends and carry a fine bond of trust and caring between them . 

but jim still longs to set foot on the red planet . 

the mission is in earnest as luc and his team land in the cydonia region of mars . 

they send out the rover to investigate the area and discover what seems to be water or ice under the surface . 

going out to investigate , luc and his team approach the famed 'face on mars' . 

a strange noise emanates from the rock . 

as the team tries to scan through the rock with radar , a violent wind storm erupts , creating a vortex that kills all members of the team , save for luc . 

back on the space station orbiting earth , woody and jim receive the information that the mars landing team is missing . 

luc's interference laden emergency message urges the two men to attempt a second mission to the red planet in the hopes of rescuing the previous team . 

the second journey to the martian world is fraught with danger . 

meteorite showers , explosions , and rescues all come into play as the intrepid heroes make there way to the planet's surface . 

the big question is , is there now or has there ever been intelligent life on mars . 

and if so , what is its relationship with us ? 

now for the bad news . 

the entire plot of "" mission to mars "" is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe . 

the famed 'face on mars' becomes the centerpiece of the film , revealing some of the most harebrained sci-fi pabulum the screen has witnessed . 

borrowing ideas from such films as "" robinson crusoe on mars "" ( 1964 ) , quatermass and the pit ( 1967 ) , "" 2001 : a space odyssey "" , and even mario bava's "" planet of the vampires "" ( 'terrore nello spazio' ) ( 1965 ) , "" mission to mars "" is a hodgepodge of ideas that don't add up to a satisfying whole . 

while some sequences are wonderfully handled and executed , the film remains flat and un-involving . 

so much time is giving to establishing the lead characters in the film , but to no good use . 

the performances are all workmen like , with only don cheadle ( as luc ) carrying any sort of real chemistry . 

gary sinise is wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation . 

and the mistaken idea of having jerry o'connell ( as phil ohlmyer ) play his part for comic relief is just too painful to excuse . 

and the less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better . 

he's just having too much fun here to give a damn . 

the script has a few lapses , namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused by a meteorite shower , no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage . 

this of course leads to our heroes having to abandon their rescue ship . 

also , when one character sacrifices himself , the character takes on a religious demeanor that is completely at odds with the situation . 

but the biggest offence in the film is the horrid , intrusive score by ennio morricone . 

subtlety is non-existent here . 

in fact in some scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out . 

the only sequence in which the score almost works is during the protracted meteorite shower . 

the pacing of the film is very leisurely . 

after the opening introduction of the characters ( which lasts a full 22 minutes ) , we are finally dropped onto the martian surface . 

then , there is another long pause in the plot for more character development , including an elaborate dance sequence in zero gravity . 

the film could lose about 30 minutes and actually gain some momentum . 

there are so many scenes of talking heads , discussing what we already know is going to happen , that it drags the film to a dead stop . 

the good news is that the film is absolutely sumptuous to look at . 

the vistas of the planet mars are majestic and awe inspiring . 

the design of the numerous spacecraft and suits are all expertly drafted , with a level of realism that hasn't been seen since "" 2001 : a space odyssey "" . 

the visual effects are just stunning , from the space walk sequences , to the visualization of evolution on earth . 

the only fault come with the martians themselves , which look more like something out of a plastic model kit than something from another world . 

director de palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes through out the film . 

the opening sequence alone in a seemingly un-interrupted cut lasting almost 15 minutes ( an homage' to hitchcock's "" rope "" ) , as we are introduced to all of the characters . 

scenes in the rescue ship , with its rotating centrifuge , are just amazing in their execution . 

but the nagging question , is the final explanation worth all of this sturm und drang . 

sadly it is not . 

director brian de palma has crafted an extravagant production . 

the set design and visual effects are all arresting . 

but it's the comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have been a fine return to good adventurous , thought provoking science fiction . 

a disappointing film , but one that might still entertain if you can settle for the visuals . 
"
"the film starts out with a creepy opening sequence to which has the now classic and creepy score by writer/director/producer john carpenter who in my mind is a brilliant director , he really is . 

he wrote this film , he directed this film , he produced this film and he made the excessively creepy score to this film . 

i think he is and always will be famous for this classic which after 21 years has not lost it's popularity or it's ability to scare the wits out of people . 

i think i have seen 'halloween' over 100 times and each time i find something new and brilliant , and each time i am scared even though i know what is going to happen . 

i own three different versions of the film : a vhs regular version that came with a limited edition 20th anniversary t-shirt , a boxed edition vhs in a hardcover case digitally re-mastered with the original theatrical widescreen presentation , in a nifty plastic picture decorated box with a numbered snow-globe . 

in other words i am completely and utterly obsessed with the film . 

it has changed horror movies forever and spawned six sequels with only 2 , 4 , and 7 being truly good . 

it also spawned several cheap imitations of the film that were offensive in some ways to a true halloween fan . 

since i heard about halloween being released on dvd in a limited edition of 30 , 000 copies , i knew i had to buy one no matter what ! 

i did and man to me it's the best dvd ever manufactured with the brilliance of the film . 

no words can describe the dvd . 

in 'halloween' michael myers is a evil person whom killed his sister in cold blood 16 years ago in 1963 . 

now in 1978 grown up and in a mental hospital michael myers escapes to go back to his hometown of haddonfield , illinois , followed by his past doctor sam loomis . 

the person michael is targeting is laurie strode who is played by jamie lee curtis in her film debut . 

why is he stalking her ? 

check out halloween ii it explains it all . 

on this unholy night on october 31 , 1978 laurie strode and her two friends are going to have the time of their lives , which is trying to stay alive . 

the whole film is filled with terrifying moments most coming from just seeing michael myers walk . 

nick castle who played the shape in the first movie did an incredible job , and no other person in any other halloween flick can do what he did . 

what john carpenter did in 1978 is made a ground-breaking new film , with scares , wit , and style . 

the movie is flawless if not perfect . 

no other movie or sequel has lived up to this one , and in my opinion never will . 

'halloween' will be like 'psycho' and still be extremely popular even almost 40 years later . 

i just hope someday 'halloween' will be released in a new dolby soundtrack with the 4 extra scenes on the dvd edition . 

'halloween' isn't just another slice-and-dice horror flick , it's an intelligent , horrifying and best film experience ever made . 

see 'halloween' and be scared . . . . then 

watch it again !

"director doug ellin's kissing a fool , released earlier this year , is an aptly titled comedy about two plastic couples housed in an artificial story . 

like a sitcom with jokes so lame that it would be impossible to overlay a laugh track on it , the movie meanders along insulting the viewers' intelligence in almost every frame . 

the script by james frey and the director is filled with vapid actors who read meaningless lines you've heard before . 

 ( "" i'm not wearing any underwear , "" the bimbo tells the famous sportscaster , max , in what she assumes will be a sure-fire come-on line . ) 

max , chicago's biggest playboy , decides to get married after a whirlwind love affair with sam , short for samantha . 

max and sam possess two irritating personalities , and they hold little chemistry for each other or the audience . 

max is played without any style by david schwimmer . 

schwimmer , whose acting talent is playing characters devoid of personality , makes an unlikely lover . 

his costar , mili avital as sam , is cut from the same cloth , so they can be argued to be a matched pair . 

after all , people of the same intelligence are naturally drawn to each other , ditto for similar looks , so why shouldn't the personality-challenged be attracted ? 

the implausible plot has max asking his best friend , jay ( jason lee ) , to hit on sam as a test . 

jay is supposed to try to get her to sleep with him , but stop short of the actual act . 

max , being promiscuous by nature , worries that his future bride may have the same need to sleep around as he does . 

the idea of flirting with the beautiful sam makes jay so sick that he becomes unable to eat or work . 

neither the script nor the actors make this test believable . 

 "" the 64 , 000 question is : how do you know you're with the wrong person so you can avoid wreaking havoc on major parts of your life ? "" 

jay asks in one of the unsuccessful attempts at adding some seriousness to the film . 

finally , there is the film's attempt at physical comedy . 

jay's ex-girlfriend natasha ( vanessa angel ) becomes infatuated with jay again once she thinks he is going out with someone else . 

natasha rips jay's shirt open after pushing him down onto the sofa . 

as she throws her hair on his bare chest , she demands he pull it . 

this is supposed to be funny ? 

most films have some saving grace . 

some bit part was done especially well or some scene managed to be funny even if the rest of the picture wasn't . 

kissing a fool , on the other hand , has nothing to recommend it . 

kissing a fool runs 1 : 45 . 

it is rated r for profanity and sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers .

"american pie acknowledges a cold , hard fact that most movies don't : it is very difficult to get laid . 

its four virgin heroes are jim ( biggs ) , a chronic masturbator , kev ( nicholas ) , who desperately wants to deflower his girlfriend ( reid ) , oz ( klein ) , a lacrosse player whose approach requires some fine tuning , and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) , a germphobe ( his crass nickname is hilarious , but i won't spoil it here ) who pays a classmate to spread rumours about the size of his member . 

jim , kev , oz and finch attend a high school in suburban michigan full of so many impossibly beautiful women it's no wonder they're horny all the time . 

after a party at their studly friend stifler's ( seann william scott , in the film's sharpest performance ) house leaves them sexually unsatisfied , the quartet make a pact : to "" lose it "" by graduation-specifically , prom night , which is only a few weeks away . 

american pie is in the tradition of bachelor party or revenge of the nerds . 

almost every conversation these characters have revolves around makin' whoopee . 

all women are there to be ogled . 

 ( alyson hannigan's perky music student is the only memorable female of the bunch . ) 

situations abound that defy logic only to arouse and/or amuse its core audience , adolescent boys . 

 ( to arouse : nadia's ( shannon elizabeth ) internet striptease-an unexpectedly raucous ( and guiltily pleasurable ) sequence . 

to amuse : jim's lusty encounter with a hot apple pie . ) 

what differentiates american pie from those dirty eighties comedies , aside from a very nineties obsession with bodily fluids * , is a cast that's light years more appealing than that of , say , just one of the guys . 

two more standouts : klein and "" sctv "" 's eugene levy . 

klein plays a kind-hearted athlete for the second time in a row , after alexander payne's underappreciated election . 

i hope to see more of this warm actor with the disarmingly honest face very soon . 

levy's is the most crowd-pleasing performance , and indeed , it's nice to see him back on the big screen in a role that makes wonderful use of that expressive brow . 

american pie also wants to emulate the teen flicks your parents _would_ let you watch growing up . 

it skillfully employs a broad mix of pop tunes , much like john hughes' movies did , and even pays homage to the breakfast club a couple of times , most evidently when the prom band covers simple minds' "" don't you ( forget about me ) . "" 

the picture ultimately has a healthy , if obligatory , attitude towards safe sex-even at their most libidinous , american pie's protagonists first whip out a condom . 

the filmmakers prove that socially responsible raunch is possible . 

for its familiarity and for its charming leads , i recommend american pie , but the buzz on this film had me expecting something . . . fresher . 

as far as the new teen cinema goes , it's at the top of the heap . 

 * don't say i didn't warn you about the party scene .

"one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction . 

the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy , innocent fun . 

sometimes the stories are compelling . 

sometimes they're not . 

but , with the exception of the first film in the series ( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ) , i've never been bored by any of the enterprise's numerous missions . 

star trek : insurrection is no exception . 

the film has gotten some negative reviews ( a friend of mine actually thinks it's the worst in the series ) , but i'm not really sure why . 

it's an exciting , often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film . 

some say it's a bit too light , and more of a long episode than a film . 

others say the special effects are cheesy and that it's boring . 

i simply enjoyed the film . 

insurrection , which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast , introduces us to a race of people called the ba'ku ; the ba'ku are very old ( most of them are about three hundred years old ) , but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet . 

of course , these peaceful people can't horde this fountain of youth all for themselves ? leave it up to their archenemies , the son'a , led by ru'afo ( f . 

murray abraham ) , to mess everything up . 

the son'a , who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable , strike a deal with the federation to move the ba'ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying . 

that's when captain picard ( patrick stewart ) steps in : he realizes that moving the ba'ku would kill them ( it also helps that he falls in love with a ba'ku woman ( donna murphy ) ) . 

so , with his trusty crew , picard defies the federation to keep the ba'ku in their natural habitat . 

when dealing with a series with as much history as this , it's not entirely necessary to re-introduce your characters with each episode . 

this is why i believe non-fans have a hard time getting into star trek ; in order to enjoy it , one has to understand how to approach it . 

insurrection , however , does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters . 

stewart is bold as always , a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together . 

jonathan frakes , who also directed , is funny as commander riker ; a subplot with data ( brent spiner ) discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting ; and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain , overacting like crazy . 

frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact ; insurrection is an exciting film , with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action . 

this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation , and the result is very pleasing to the eye : particularly in the climactic scenes , in which the son'a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba'ku planet , the special effects have a clean , impressively sharp look . 

if i have any complaint about the film , it's that it tries to take a moral stance when it's not very appropriate to do so . 

i don't think it's that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba'ku in order to save the lives of thousands . 

better yet , why couldn't they have co-existed ? 

insurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience . 

with it's inherent camp factor , the star trek series doesn't seem well-equipped to deal with issues like this . 

i prefer to just enjoy the spectacle .

"after the terminally bleak reservoir dogs and the brutally violent pulp fiction , jackie brown seems like something of a light-hearted departure for quentin tarantino . 

it's more of a ho-hum heist story with characters that speak the tarantino language . 

luckily , his showcase of actors convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen , and jackie brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer . 

the story introduces us to a street-wise black woman named jackie brown ( pam grier ) , a flight attendant who smuggles money and drugs from one destination to another . 

she works for a bottom-of-the-barrel airline and receives a minimal salary . 

but one day , she is picked up by a pair of federal officials ( including michael keaton as the tough-nosed ray nicolet ) , and found with a handsome load of cash and a small bag of smuggled dope . 

jackie is working for a weapons dealer named ordell ( samuel l . jackson ) , who pays her bail money but suspects her of tipping off the feds about their operation . 

soon jackie and ordell are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 through to them under nicolet's nose , with the help of ordell's oaf of a partner ( robert de niro ) and drugged-out lady friend ( bridget fonda ) . 

also entering the picture is a bail-bondsman named max cherry ( robert forster ) , who takes a liking to jackie and agrees at one point to make the situation even more complicated ( how i won't say ) . 

the big drop-off is undoubtedly the high point of jackie brown , in which numerous double-crosses take place and many clothing store bags ( filled with cash ) switch hands . 

it's unfortunate that tarantino takes his sweet time getting there , and doesn't offer anything extremely compelling while doing so . 

there are , as always , amusing exchanges between characters . 

the funniest repartee is between de niro and fonda , as he becomes annoyed with her constant bickering while making fun of his iq , or lack thereof . 

the most interesting relationship is between max and jackie . 

a 56-year old white bail bondsman and a 44-year old black flight attendant with believable chemistry ? 

you've got to commend the acting . 

jackie brown is a seriously dragged-out exercise enlivened by such fine acting . 

the film clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours , 35 minutes . 

tarantino's talky style manages to hold your attention heavily , but there are more than a few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline . 

also , fans of the director should be prepared for a lighter side to appear . 

jackie brown has four major shootings , and two of those take place mostly off-screen , so don't be expecting a typical tarantino bloodbath . 

you can expect frequent foul language , mostly coming way of ordell , who ( much to the dismay of spike lee ) uses the `n' word as part of his regular vocabulary . 

the acting is the glue that holds everything together . 

grier , making a sudden comeback from her reign in the 1970's , is more than adequate for the title character . 

in fact , she's flat-out great . 

another comeback comes from former tv star robert forster , who does a grand job as max cherry , and is perfectly cast in doing so . 

michael keaton makes his presence felt , albeit in small but dignified moments , and de niro is ideal in playing the lug-head who goes over the edge . 

speaking of that , bridget fonda has relatively little to do as ordell's bikini-clad beach babe , and yet she manages to look fairly occupied . 

there's not a single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line throughout the entire movie . 

which is a life-saver for mr . tarantino . 

the story barely holds together in the meantime , and we merely get a small tremor whenever there should be a defeaning earthquake . 

but oh well . 

jackie brown manages to be an enjoyable detour from quentin tarantino , even if it is lacking the glaring and original bite of his previous work . 

let's just hope that the director hasn't gone soft on us .

"plot : during a 10-week span in london in the fall of 1888 , jack the ripper , a man whose identity was never uncovered , committed five ritualistic , grisly murders of prostitutes . 

this film is based on the graphic novel which assembled a theory behind the century-old mystery . 

critique : awesome ! 

i love dark movies , i love stylish movies , i love good mysteries and i love johnny depp . . . so 

yes , i really dug this movie ! 

the hughes brothers are back with a vengeance , out to show the world that they are directors to be taken seriously , and this movie , my friends . . . is 

very serious ! 

in fact , it's also very gruesome and bloody and morbid and creepy and black as hell . 

it ain't for the kids , i'll tell you that much . 

and if any of those recent hack directors of two-bit scream-esque slasher flicks want some advice on effective "" kill scenes "" , do not look any further , because each one committed to this film is a cinematic stunner , especially when compared to their generic slice-and-dice contrivances . 

in fact , most of this film's structure is very creative , the actors , all solid , the atmosphere and "" feel "" of the picture , remarkably real ( gotta love those "" unfortunates "" ) , and the descent into darkness , well honed by the filmmakers . 

you can almost taste the seediness off the screen and quickly come to appreciate the politics of the time . 

but it's also an impressive mystery film , based on the true-life tale of jack the ripper , a man whose identity was never discovered . 

the theory in this film is based on the graphic novel "" from hell "" written by alan moore and presents a compelling story , which despite being a little oliver stone-ish , did manage to tie up all of its loose ends quite nicely , and present us with an entertaining bowl of mayhem , sexual depravity , drug usage , insanity , murders and love ? 

yes , the brothers even managed to slip a little "" love "" story in here , and despite not truly being developed , i guess it could've been much worse and taken up more time than was provided already . 

that's right , there's no real need to put any "" romance "" in a film about a mass murderer ! 

but that aside , you gotta give up the props to actor extraordinaire johnny depp , who once again possesses the strength in character and flawless acting abilities , to center this movie all the way through . 

sure , he's just playing a less goofier version of his ichabod crane character from sleepy hollow , but he does it so well and even added a michael caine accent to his mixed bag of tricks in this one . 

i was also surprised at how little heather graham annoyed me in this film ( i was sure that her presence would ruin this movie , but she was fine ) and how little the dreams/fantasies of depp's character had to do with the film's development ( from what i had seen in the trailer , i thought the filmmakers were going to make this the crux of the story , but thankfully , it wasn't ) . 

on the downside , the film doesn't really explain the whole freemasons cult organization real well and lacks character development . 

but then again , a story about the most mysterious serial killer of all-time is probably not the ideal spot for character refinement . 

i mean , the less i knew about each person , the more suspicious i became of each one's motives , reasons , etc . . . 

in fact , i was actually quite surprised by who was presented as the killer in the end , and that was in part , due to the distance to which i'd been held from the film's characters . . . or 

am i giving the filmmakers too much credit for something that might not have been their intention ? 

perhaps . 

overall , this is an extremely creepy production , with glorious cinematography ( reminiscent of coppola's dracula and burton's sleepy hollow ) , a grim score and solid acting . 

but it's not for everyone . 

some may be utterly repulsed by the gory particulars of these tragic events , and even though the murders aren't shown as graphically as you might think , there's enough here to send the squeamish right out the doors . 

but i for one love movies that blend their eclectic visual style with an interesting mystery and palpable , gothic atmosphere , and this flick is just that and plenty more ! 

and god knows that i will certainly not be surrendering the burnt image of jack the ripper's haunting cape silhouette and gleaming silver knife from my mind anytime soon . . . brrrrr ! 

where's joblo coming from ?

"the ultimate match up between good and evil , "" the untouchables "" is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry . 

based on the 1959 television show of the same title , "" the untouchables "" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script . 

the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public . 

elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order . 

however , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws . 

the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes . 

the film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws . 

the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone's men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl . 

from this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard . 

right from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs . 

this developed hatred is before the film's hero , ness , is even introduced . 

i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone . 

the film only gets better from this point . 

with the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats . 

they walk in unison and they only look forward . 

as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens . 

holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films . 

one that comes to mind is "" the matrix "" when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world . 

wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930's style , the similarities between these two are countless . 

 "" the untouchables "" has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film . 

the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone's army . 

each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others . 

elliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film . 

he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be . 

however , as the film develops so does ness . 

his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side . 

he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends . 

his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in . 

sean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables . 

malone acts as a mentor to ness . 

he teaches him "" the chicago way "" to do things ; when they attack with a knife , you attack with a gun . 

connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed . 

andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man who is just becoming a police officer . 

as ness grows , he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him . 

charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone . 

smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film . 

the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen . 

also very similar to "" the matrix , "" they are exciting and intense . 

>from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps , the scenes are well thought out and well executed . 

the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement . 

its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors . 

the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective . 

although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified , this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting , great directing , and great action . 

some scenes ( capone and the baseball bat , the train station ) have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid .

"ingredients : pouring rain , small flooded town , damn about to burst , bad guys going after millions of dollars 

synopsis : at one point in the story townsperson karen asks hero tom what happened to her church . 

he replies something like : "" the church is flooded but at least the floodwaters put out the big fire . 

well , the fire wasn't that bad , since , while the church was burning , looters apparently thought it was safe enough to break through all the priceless stained glass windows . "" 

in hard rain a small town is nearly deserted due to flooding . 

everyone has had to evacuate because it's raining , and now floodwaters are rising so high that buildings are being submerged and the nearby dam is about to break . 

enter a working class smart-alecky new armored car driver named tom ( christian slater ) . 

suddenly his security truck carrying over three million dollars gets stuck on the flooded street and is waylaid by armed looters . 

tom has no choice but to grab the bag full of money , hide it , and swim for his life . 

this makes for an action movie full of jet skis , speedboat chases , and gun battles , as tom tries to evade and outsmart corrupt cops and armed looters until the national guard can answer his distress call . 

he is befriended and aided by a spunky churchgoing young woman from town named karen ( minnie driver ) . 

but unknown to tom and karen , the national guard never heard tom's initial distress call . 

will tom and karen survive the natural and manmade disasters ? 

opinion : don't expect thought-provoking issues or dramatics . 

there's not much more to this movie than hiding , running , swimming , shooting , and saving handcuffed heroes from drowning , but that's what makes it escapist and fun . 

relax , take your shoes off , and break out the popcorn .

"frank detorri's ( bill murray ) a single dad who lives on beer and junk food with no apparent understanding of sanitation or hygiene , much to the dismay of his preteen daughter shane ( elena franklin ) . 

when he uses the '10 second rule' to retrieve a hard boiled egg from a chimp's cage at the zoo and downs it , he introduces a lethal bacteria into his system . 

inside his skin , the city of frank is in turmoil thanks to the vote-pandering of mayor phlegmming ( voice of william shatner ) , so it's up to one frank pd white blood cell ( voice of chris rock ) to save the day in peter and bobby farrelly's "" osmosis jones . "" 

the city of frank is a brightly animated ( animation directed by piet kroon and tom sito ) cellular municipality where osmosis jones is a typical rogue cop looking for another chance . 

he's inadvertently teamed up with drix ( voice of david hyde pierce , tv's "" frasier "" ) , a cold capsule with 12 hours worth of painkillers to dispense . 

this quarrelling duo are about to go on a "" fantastic voyage "" in order to hunt down thrax ( voice of laurence fishburne ) , the virus intent on shutting down frank . 

while the animation is certainly colorful to look at , osmosis jones' story is a hackneyed one . 

the story cries out for puny puns , but we only get occasional sprinklings of wit or bodily humor ( drix graduated phi beta capsule , he departs on a bus headed for bladder ) . 

neither the hero or villain is particularly interesting ( thrax looks like an animated "" predator "" ) , although hyde pierce is a delightful sidekick . 

adults can desperately keep their eyes peeled for small amusements the animators dot along the landscape . 

meanwhile , back in live action land , bill murray is reduced to nothing more than a walking gross-out joke . 

there's no particular enjoyment to be found watching him vomit on molly shannon ( she plays shane's teacher , mrs . boyd ) or hoisting his ingrown toenail onto a restaurant table . 

one must wonder how the climatic flatlining of a child's father will play to the family audience as well . 

rest assured , the whole enchilada is wrapped up with a fart joke . 

while far less offensive than the farrelly's last effort "" me , myself and irene , "" that film at least spiked some comic highs with jim carrey's hijinx . 

 "" osmosis jones "" will probably be ok for the kids , but the farrellys playing for the family audience is like watching marilyn manson croon a phil collins tune .

"i had lost all faith in pg-13 movies that are intended for teenagers and adults . 

the last dozen or so that i have seen have all felt incomplete , as if the most crucial scene was deleted in order to obtain a more lucrative rating . 

however , after seeing the creative frequency last week and now the exciting u-571 , my bias is beginning to go away . 

both films are as innocuous for younger viewers as they are intellectual for older viewers . 

even better , i didn't think either one of these films would be any good from first instincts . 

everyone loves surprises . 

u-571 looked like another action film using an actual war as an excuse to shoot torpedoes and bullets . 

this may be true , but the action is so extraordinary that it is clear director/co-writer jonathan mostow completed his ultimate goal ; to blow the audience's socks off . 

set during the early stages of world war 2 when the united states struggled to break the codes of the technologically advanced german u-boats , u-571 follows a small crew of american men who swipe the typewriter necessary to solve the enigma from an enemy ship . 

there's only one problem : the american ship they came from and hoped to return to has been shot down stranding the men on a german submarine known as ( you guessed it ) u-571 . 

it is now up to the mostly young and inexperienced sailors , led by an interim captain named tyler ( matthew mcconaughey ) , to return the typewriter to america without getting sunk by far superior german ships . 

the film starts off very slowly with a somewhat weak opening action sequence and another uneventful half an hour to introduce several of the sailors ( most of whom die when the mission goes awry or just inexplicably disappear ) . 

once the crew gets on the u-boat , the movie shifts to another level and never leaves this high energy level until the ending credits roll down . 

as soon as the action starts , it does not stop and luckily , because it is so exciting , i didn't want it to stop . 

this is not a movie for those wanting to avoid loud noises , from the wonderful , heart-pounding score to the constant yelling of panicking men , make sure you see this at a theater with surround-sound ? otherwise , do not see it all . 

the best parts of u-571 are when tyler is forced to make impromptu decisions on how to escape seemingly impossible situations . 

throughout the movie , several morals or characters are introduced to make tyler's job as stressful as possible . 

germans gun down their own men , tyler's mentor captain dahlgren warns him that a captain has to be prepared to sacrifice even the most beloved soldiers for a victory , another sailor ( erik palladino ) threatens mutiny . 

all of these examples , and several others , increase the chaotic atmosphere and the importance of tyler's every move . 

they also make u-571 one of the most exhilarating movies i have seen in a while .

"synopsis : melissa , a mentally-disturbed woman who likes to smoke , seduces doug , a minor-league baseball player who likes to study anatomy , work on motorcycles , and make out with his girlfriend in a public library . 

when doug decides to stop seeing her , melissa maliciously takes revenge on those around him , including his girlfriend , his mother , and his cat . 

comments : malicious , i suppose , is an acceptable moview for what it is : a cheap , b-movie thriller which rips off dozens and dozens of spurned-psycho-lover-who-wants-revenge films ( like fatal attraction , hand that rocks the cradle , etc . etc . ) that have come before it . 

malicious , however , really doesn't provide very many particularly suspenseful moments . 

the plot starts off energetically enough , the main characters are introduced and the affair between doug and melissa begins and ends pretty early on in the film . 

it starts to drag , unfortunately , after this . 

melissa will obviously try to take her revenge on doug ( as always seems to happen in movies like these ) , but she does so in unimaginative ways that have been done in other , better thrillers before . 

she drugs someone . 

she kills a family pet and leaves it in the girlfriend's apartment . 

and , of course , she stalks , so we see a number of shots , which are supposed to be suspenseful , where she's spying on doug and his girlfriend . 

i won't reveal the ludicrous ending to this turkey , but i warn you that it's both painfully obvious and a real yawner . 

john vernon does a remarkably good job at playing the not-so-bright baseball jock who initially gets swept away by melissa ( one of the script's faults is to try to pass off a character like this as a pre-med student ) . 

the same cannot be said , though , for molly ringwald . 

at times , she can effectively pull off the obsessed lover routine , especially during her silent , i'm-going-to-stare-you-down scenes . 

at other times , however , she just seems somehow goofy and out of place . 

in one particular scene which i guess was supposed to be suspenseful , she screeches "" f--k you , you b-----d "" and throws a phone . 

she delivers the line so ridiculously that one can't help but laugh . 

malicious certainly isn't the worst thriller of its kind out in the video racks ( a number of really fat turkies in this genre are out there ) , but it isn't all that good or original either . 

feel free to treat this film maliciously , watch something else . 
"
"it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship , a green ovular pin , and the birth of oscar wilde , but if one really strains , they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off . 

wilde's philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature , and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned , loosing his family and his career . 

the glam rock movement in the early 70s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demise . 

the main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life ( mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality ) , they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else . 

and that's why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began . 

it's been said that todd haynes' "" velvet goldmine , "" the film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement , not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it , steals a lot from "" citizen kane , "" and that's true . 

in the film , a british journalist in the 80s , arthur stuart ( christian bale ) , is asked to go back and find out what happened to 70s glam rock star brian slade , a fictitious rock star , who faked his own death on stage , bringing the end not only to his career but to the entire glam rock movement . 

structure-wise , this totally steals from "" kane , "" not only from the set-up ( he interviews three people , and the story is a result of their flashbacks ) , but in other things , like the beginning ( death , then newsreel ) , and smaller details , like the bitter ex-friend in a wheelchair and the bitter ex-wife as a washed-up lounge singer , found in a bar after hours . 

this is no "" kane , "" and it really doesn't aspire to be : it doesn't attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like "" kane "" did , and it doesn't really uncover anything poignant about humanity . 

instead , it uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era and the boredom that was life after glam rock for those who were participants . 

the 80s scenes are dry and deliriously melancholy , equipped with a performance by bale that is perhaps appropriately dull and unengaging . 

but the 70s scenes are engaging , though , not to mention addictively campy . 

they radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era , and a feel that's so eerily lighthearted that when combined with the then-footage , they become not only a symbol of decadence , but of times when everything seemed so simple . 

instead of creating the world the way it was , haynes paints their own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale : the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom and liberation that after you've experienced it , everything else seems so mundane . 

there's no outside world to speak of , secluding these people inside a protective globe that will eventually crack . 

haynes focuses his story on the tale of blade and the other fictitious rock hero , curt wild , and their relationship that created , molded , and then brought down the movement , reducing everyone else who contributed to it as merely that - contributors . 

blade - played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers - and wild - played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor - are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie and iggy pop , respectively , complete with the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well not only have been one-time partners in music , but also partners in bed . 

through discussions with slade's ex-manager cecil ( michael feast ) , ex-wife mandy ( toni collette , reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent when with slade ) , and finally ex-partner wild , journalist stuart begins to remember his own experiences in the era , like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity , including the moment when he began questioning his own sexuality ( when he opens up his first slade record , he finds a naked and green slade lying on a crimson blanket ) , and finally running away from home to be part of the london scene , finally resulting in leading a boring job in america . 

haynes demonstrates that he's quite the visual auteur , molding scenes that are like long heald breaths , such as a seemingly long sequence juxtaposing a slade/wild concert of them performing a brian eno cover , "" baby's on fire , "" with scenes from a decadent drug party ; and the film's most wow-inspiring sequence , the first concert scene of wild with his band , the ratttz , where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggy-esuqe movements ( including stripping naked ) and screams that the film captures that perfect moment when one discovers a major talent , and another ( slade ) discovers his idle . 

even the brief music videos , spoofs of bowie's , have a rare visual flair that's pure camp , and which would cause ken russell to drool . 

the best sequence , though , may be the beginning , following the prelude , a sequence which acts as the middle ground for both the actual being of the movement and the post-movement era . 

in it , stuart and his mates are going to the infamous slade concert where he fakes his own death , where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in what appears to be a real assasination , which brought about the end of the era in one swift fake bullet . 

with brian eno's famous "" needle in the camel's eye "" playing in the background , the scene has a detached exhileration - the song doesn't seem to be played in quite the same way the other songs are . 

it has a distance that's hard to put a finger on , and it seems to represent that all this is coming to a quick and sad ending , and when one sees slade in the dressing room before the show , docked in a silver frock with wings and blue hair , depressingly staring into the mirror , it comes off as a none-too-obvious prophecy of the finale in the beginning of the film . 

this movie's not so much about plot , but more about the way it is presented , making this one of those films which is classified as being "" style over substance , "" a statement which prompts many critics to line up for attack . 

however , for the most part , the engaging part of this film is not the story but rather the way in which haynes creates this world , by using his sets , costumes , cinematography , and especially the music to play as characters in his film . 

the music is especially notable . 

the soundtrack , which is wall to wall , consists of old school glam rock tunes by the likes of brian eno , t-rex , and roxy music , as well as covers by slade's band ( with vocals by thom yorke , and occasionally rhys meyers himself ) , and even newer music by shudder to think that sounds uncannily bowie-like . 

the cast is rather impressive , but no one really walks away with the film , and no performances are extremely good . 

although eddie izzard , as slade's manager ( who challenges slade's first manager to an arm-wrestling match to see who gets control of his career ) and michael feast as the first and tragic manager come off greatly , and collette and mcgregor have their moments , rhys meyers and bale are noticably sub-par , neither putting a lot of effort into their respective roles . 

some of it is at fault with the actual construction of the film by haynes . 

rhys meyers' brian slade remains merely a metaphor for the glam rock era , dying when he turned into a retro-garbo , resorting to a life of salinger-ism , and found in the mid-70s to be lying around , sniffing coke off the ass of a party girl . 

in fact , no one in this film is really seen as a person , rather than just as a symbol or composite of a type who thrived during the era . 

bale's character is an especially tough sell : bitter and depressed by flashbacks to his young adulthood , he's not an extremely personal character , and his cliched experiences ( being hounded by the record store guys for buying a record put out by a "" poof "" ) never help us communicate with him . 

nevertheless , rhys meyers and mcgregor have the excuses that their characters are not really characters but rather the results of an era that has left them , and others , bitter , part of which helps the film work , since this is a major piece of eye candy . 

at the prime of the movie , they at least look the role of fashionable leaders - slade with his perpetually-changing , androgonys persona , and wild with his topless and unpredictable image , which clash and fuse into an unstable union . 

their story - of how slade was so influenced by wild that he adapted it into a similar who-cares attitude crossed with camp - is engaging , without the personal background . 

the story of stuart , though , is a tougher sell because he's the everyman , and when you can't totally identify with the everyman , your story's in slight trouble . 

as a cultural rock piece , "" velvet goldmine "" is rather good , but it is merely good . 

it never totally takes off , although it has moments where it absolutely flies , but then comes back down . 

it's really nothing more than a bunch of really great moments , surrounded by material that could really be much better . 

the beginning is captivating but slow , the middle is fantastic , and the ending is not only shallow but worse than that , it drags ( the final half hour not only does it not bring the story to any real conclusion , it could probably stop at any point ) . 

and did anyone really figure out what the mystery is that arthur unearths ? 

it almost seems like there was no point in the entire investigation other than to unearth the past , which is commendable but not totally so . 

still , it does what the oliver stone pic "" the doors "" didn't do right , becoming very insightful to what happened , using the visual style to hit most of the right notes of contrast between what made the era so great to those who lived during it and why after living through such an era that everything else seems half-assed ( i suppose the message is : "" live life , but after you've lived it , what else is the point when you'll be forced to live with regretful memories ? "" ) . 

the really superb achievement of this film is that during its flashbacks , it successfully creates for the audience what it must have felt like to be in that era , but with the added perk of knowing the result of all that goes down .

"once again , the battle is dreamworks versus disney : earlier this year , the mammoth companies fought to the death with their end-of-the-world asteroid flicks , deep impact and armageddon . 

here we are now , just a few months later , and they're at it again with dueling bug movies , antz and a bug's life . 

what i find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story and execution . 

i mean , come on -- what were the chances of two studios both deciding to bring out computer-animated films about bugs ? 

as was the case with the meteor movies , disney has come out on top : though antz is a likable movie , a bug's life is far superior . 

in fact , this movie made me realize what was wrong with antz : i became immersed in the world of a bug's life , while antz just made me scrutinize everything . 

but it's not really fair to base an entire review on a comparison . 

a bug's life is a remarkable film in its own right , and deserves to be seen apart from any other computer-animated film about bugs . 

in fact , it's one of the best films this year : it's smart , subtle , and funny , but it's also perfect family entertainment and relentlessly entertaining . 

i haven't had such a good time at the movies in months . 

it tells the story of an ant named flick ( voice by dave foley ) ; he's a nice guy , but he's also a troublemaker . 

the ants spend all season putting together the offering , a big pile of food that they provide for the grasshoppers . 

just before the grasshoppers come , flick accidentally knocks over the offering , and ruins everything for the entire colony : the grasshopper's leader , hopper ( kevin spacey ) , is enraged , and tells them that the ants need twice the food by the end of summer , or they're all dead . 

flick , feeling responsible for this , sets off to look for help -- he realizes that the only way to be rid of the grasshoppers is to fight them . 

he heads to the city ( the city being a house a few miles away ) , where he finds a colorful bunch of circus bugs : a ladybug ( denis leary , who is spectacular ) , a black widow ( bonnie hunt ) , a caterpillar ( joe ranft ) , a butterfly ( madeline kahn ) , a rhinoceros beetle ( michael mcshane ) , and a stick ( david hyde-pierce , also giving a hilarious performance ) . 

flick doesn't know they're actors , and they don't know that flick needs them to kill a bunch of grasshoppers , so they return to the colony with flick and find themselves in an unusual position . 

the most obvious element of a bug's life is the quality of animation . 

created by pixar , the same people who brought us toy story , a bug's life has some of the most amazing visuals i've ever seen . 

the bugs seem to inhabit a three-dimensional space , and occasionally there will be a shot that is indistinguishable from live action . 

this is a lush , colorful world , full of life and imagination : the way the animators insert the things all of us see in our daily lives ( matches , bottlecaps , tin cans , etc . ) and make them active objects in the bugs' world is innovative . 

the film is also mercilessly exciting , particularly in a superbly-staged scene involving our heroes' escape from a bird ( a little bird never seemed so huge and threatening ) . 

but the makers of a bug's life know where the importance lies : story and characters . 

flick , with solid voice work from foley , is a great guy to lead the story . 

but the real treat comes with the circus bugs ; they're such a likable group of characters -- the standouts are the stick ( hyde-pierce is so good ) , francis the ladybug , and the big fat caterpillar . 

all of these bugs have more than a token personality , which makes the suspenseful scenes work because we care about the bugs , and it also keeps the tear-jerking scenes from seeming obligatory . 

in my review of antz , i said that the film is a clever cop-out because it presents a bunch of little humans reacting to an ant-like existence . 

in concept , a bug's life is basically the same movie , except that i was never given enough time to find things that i didn't like about it . 

with such strong work in both animation and script , a bug's life is nothing but a joy to sit through . 

it really is too bad that it had to come out so close to that other bug movie , but a bug's life is so good that i'm sure it will find its audience . 

after a slew of endlessly violent and cynical movies , it's downright refreshing to sit through an innocent picture like this and laugh without feeling guilty .

"when the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villain , you know that you can expect nothing more than a b grade action movie . 

however , since this film also featured michael madsen , more than capable character actor , this time in the role of protagonist , the author of this review decided to give the film some benefit of the doubt . 

however , the very first scenes show clear b grade action credentials - madsen plays richard montana , tough policeman who raids a drug warehouse and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio ( played by lynch ) . 

however , the raid was only partially successful , and montana is getting the rap . 

so , he begins his own private war against gio , trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt . 

in the process , he meets gio's mistress gina zamora ( played by rosie vela ) and starts relationship with her too . 

although it doesn't stink like many of the similar films can , inside edge is mostly forgettable b grade action routine . 

nobody in this film actually puts much effort , including madsen or lynch , and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter william tannen or director warren clarke . 

the only not so forgettable element in this film is presence of former supermodel rosie vela , who , apart from showing her more than impressive looks , shows some of the singing talent too . 

however , this isn't reason enough for viewers to spend hour and half watching a film that they would , in most likelihood , forget the next day .

"a lot of times a three-star film will be my favorite . 

they're usually the kind of movie i can watch most often too . 

they're usually not too deep , allowing for semi-brainless relaxation , and at the same time , not too dumb . 

men in black is a four-star three-star film . 

 ( hope you could follow that one ) 

men in black doesn't wait to get to the fun . 

just minutes into the film we are introduced to agent kay ( tommy lee jones ) , introduced to an alien , and introduced to the the awesome memory-diminishing tool that all mib agents use . 

after all , you can't have alien witnesses running around with that kind of knowledge can you ? 

men in black is , of course , the organization which "" moniters all extra-terrestrial activity on earth "" . 

nypd officer james edwards ( will smith ) , is on a routine foot chase when suddenly the no-good punk he's chasing starts leaping up buildings and blinking more than one pair of eyes . 

the alien delivers the simple message that the world is going to end , and with that , dives off of a roof . 

naturally nobody believes his story . 

 . 

 . 

nobody that is , except for the top secret organization that not even the government is aware of . 

edwards then meets agent kay , the man who never seems to crack a smile , and is introduced to the mib . 

edwards winds up joining the team and is stripped of anything that can point back to him ( birth certificate , drivers license , and even the literal removal of his fingerprints ) . 

james edwards no longer exists . 

meet agent jay . 

agent kay takes the rookie jay under his wing as they go about "" regular "" duties . 

eventually a far more treacherous event comes into play . 

a "" bug "" has landed on earth and is going to wipe out mankind if these two don't ( or can't ) stop it . 

the plot isn't exactly clear , but we know it has to do with a galaxy as big as a jewel or marble being sought after on earth , and that is crucial that the mib find it before the "" bug "" does . 

barry sonnenfeld , who also did the addams family films , directs this nicely . 

it's fun , it's funny , it's action-packed . 

a nice summer blockbuster as it rightfully turned out to be . 

this is one of those movies that is just "" fun "" and can't really be summed up any nicer or clearer . 

will smith and tommy lee jones both do great jobs and both are a blast to watch . 

definitely one of the best films of the the summer of '97 , men in black comes highly recommeded from me !

"reflecting on "" bedazzled , "" a lively comedy about the devil who seeks to possess the soul of a pathetic loser , one sinful thought remains in my mind . 

if hell means having to spend an eternity with elizabeth hurley ( who portrays the fiery demon ) , then use that pitchfork and point me the way . 

with her pouty lips , irresistible british accent , and wild display of haute couture , hurley crackles with naughtiness and fills your mind with temptation . 

it's practically impossible to turn this beelzu-babe down . 

her next target is elliot ( brendan fraser ) , a tech support geek who is clumsy , awkward , and just too eager to please . 

to aptly picture him , you would have to remember a saturday night live skit featuring "" steve the copy guy "" who effortlessly irritated his co-workers with his unpolished social skills . 

eugene , thus , is loathed and feared by his co-workers , who do their best to stay out of his way . 

yet , beyond his annoying mannerisms , he's a lovable oaf . 

he wishes that he could get closer to allison ( frances o'connor ) , a co-worker with whom he is infatuated but who has never taken notice of him . 

however , the odds of him getting together with her are about the same as a snowball's chance in hell . 

 "" dear god , "" he prays . 

 "" i would give anything to have that girl in my life . "" 

guess who then shows up ? 

she makes an offer that is too hard to refuse . 

 "" seven utterly fabulous wishes for one piddling little soul . "" 

there's even an escape clause . 

if elliot's wish doesn't go exactly the way he likes , he need only 'beep' her ( one guess as to what the three-digit number is ) and he gets to start over . 

the remainder of the film consists of elliot's various fantasies that incorporate his personal desire to have enormous amounts of wealth , power , fame and allison's love . 

but when he makes sweeping statements such as "" i want to be very , very powerful and very , very rich and married to allison "" , he'll soon learn that the devil is in the details . 

for example , ( and we've seen this several times in the trailers ) , he is granted his wish , but finds out that he's a columbian drug lord and that allison , while married to him , has her eyes on someone else . 

apparently , the devil is just as eager to skew his fantasies as she is to possess his soul . 

his other wishes also end up with some strange but funny twist that short-circuits his new life . 

soon , elliot wishes that he had never made that deal . 

given the mischievous nature of the devil , "" bedazzled "" has many amusing moments . 

a lot of the credit goes to fraser who turns in a great comic performance . 

he ably assumes various personas . 

his funniest segment is when he wishes that he could be the most sensitive man in the world . 

allison becomes so frustrated with him that she practically urges him to take advantage of her . 

hurley also heightens the humor quotient , especially in the transitional scenes when fraser waits to start his next wish after bailing out of the previous one . 

it's clear that she's having a good time with it all . 

yet , while the filmmakers work hard at creating funny scenes , they conspicuously avoid developing the allegorical underpinnings between good and evil that could have added more heft to this story . 

but that would be playing with fire . 

what they've got works , so you can easily accept it for the pleasant little comedy that it is . 
"
"surrounded by hype , high hopes , and the promise of an over-the-top performance by clueless's brittany murphy , don't say a word looked full of promise . 

hell , when i hear that "" i'll never tell "" whisper on the tv commercial , goose bumps run up my spine . 

alas , word is filled with little but disappointment , a kooky mix of girl , interrupted and ransom , with michael douglas and company collecting a paycheck to plod through a vapid and dull kidnapping thriller . 

douglas stars as nathan conrad , renowned new york psychologist , devoted father of jessie conrad ( skye mccole bartusiak ) , and loving husband to aggie conrad ( famke janssen ) . 

after a gang of jewel thieves , headed by sean bean's koster , kidnaps his daughter , nathan is forced to extract from his new patient , the catatonic and violent elisabeth burrows ( murphy ) , the location of some hidden bank job booty that her father hid from the koster gang a decade ago . 

but with hard-nosed detective sandra cassidy ( jennifer esposito , doing her best j . lo impression ) tracking down koster and his gang of hoodlums , the stakes are raised as nathan races against the clock to crack the mystery of elisabeth's head in order to get the goods inside . 

the catch - nathan only has until five o'clock to solve the puzzle ! 

whoa , the suspense is almost too much . 

don't say a word loses the audience inside of 15 minutes . 

murphy looks and acts like linda blair from the exorcist during the first part of the movie , then turns around and reprises like her role from girl , interrupted . 

and the only real "" crazy "" to be found in the film is director gary fleder's ( things to do in denver when you're dead ) staggering use of flashback sequences . 

oliver platt , famke janssen , and even sean bean are decent actors , but the stuff they are given here -- such as a bedridden wife fighting off the token black guy with her crutch -- is insulting and demeaning . 

additionally , the use of the surveillance cameras and laptops to track nathan's every move is downright unbelievable . 

how do ex-cons fresh out of the big house afford all this equipment ? 

despite its flaws , don't say a word is surprisingly some of the best mainstream film you'll find this month -- and audiences will lap it up . 

americans love lukewarm , half-baked thrillers starring big names and accompanied by cheap thrills . 

someone get me my lithium !

"capsule : an insult . 

a stupid and incompetent movie that doesn't even have the benefit of being trashily enjoyable . 

weslely and woody would do well to leave this off their resumes . 

money train is one of the worst movies i have ever seen . 

it's not simply idiotic , it's contemptuous of its audience . 

it tries to make us swallow things that a better movie would be stopped cold by or just plain omit entirely . 

it's a waste of wesley snipes and woody harrelson , who are enjoyable actors in their own rights but are nauseating here . 

it's not even fun as trash . 

woody and wesley star ( maybe that's not the right word ) as new york city transit authority police . 

they have a job which could actually be the core of a really interesting movie : one of them plays drunk possum to attract chain-snatchers and the other does lookout . 

i had a whole headful of legal and ethical questions surrounding this , raised by a documentary i'd seen on the subject once , but the movie does not waste any time with being intelligent or thought-provoking . 

see if you can follow this . 

they chase a kid down the tunnel and into the station where the "" money train "" , the heavily armored car that picks up all the cash from the token books , is parked . 

the guards on the train see this kid running at them , lift their machine guns , shout "" halt ! "" 

and then open fire when the kid doesn't stop running at them . 

blam , the kid's dead . 

then woody and wesley show up , and of course the other ta cops hate them ( why ? ) , and a pushing match starts , and someone gets decked , and . . . i covered my face . 

i'd seen enough . 

i've never seen a movie work so hard and in so little time to destroy , systematically , any chance of being credible or interesting . 

fed up with the bs at their job ( most of it their own goddamned fault ) , woody and wesley hatch this plot about how to rob the money train . 

hence the title , in case some of you ( all two of you ) didn't figure it out yet . 

then there's this subplot about a maniac who torches token book clerks , * and * a love story , * and * a holdup -- no , two holdups , sorry , easy to lose track in a movie this braindead -- * and * a mob boss who wants his money . 

there wasn't a minute when i gave a horse's ass about any of it . 

neither woody nor wesley play characters that are interesting for a single minute . 

we do not care about them . 

they are not interesting . 

they are noisy , loud , stupid , foolish jerks who whould have flunked out of the police academy . 

they deserve to get shot -- or run over , as the case may be . 

they only exist to rehash the kind of dynamics that was * written * into a movie like white men can't jump , and which simply does not exist here . 

they are idiots , and we're expected to root for them . 

bullcrap . 

the movie is completely schizophrenic in its tone and texture . 

what exactly is this mess ? 

a cop movie ? 

police procedure is not given a moment's genuine thought anywhere . 

a thriller ? 

the subplot with the token booth killer is inept , a throwaway that should have been ditched in the rewrite . 

a comedy ? 

the few jokes that do work are wasted . 

a drama ? 

all dramatic tension between both principals is freeze-dried and off-the-rack . 

there's not a moment in the movie where i felt like i was listening to genuine human beings talk ; it's all screenwriterese , that bizarre analect where every sentence ends in a punchline and the primary mode of expression is the unique conjunctions of four-letter words . 

 ( actual dialogue excerpt : "" fuck you . "" 

 "" what ? "" 

 "" you heard me : fuck * you * . "" 

 "" no : fuck * you * ! "" ) 

look . i'll be honest here . 

i've tried writing screenplays , and even * i * suspect that if i tried to pitch this mess , i'd get laughed out of the office . 

anyone interested in hearing my ideas for a few good movies can write me and hear my pitch , because god knows i know i can do better . 

i've weasted enough time on this piece of tripe . 
"
"a big surprise to me . 

the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off , but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues ( john belushi ) is such a dumb idea i really had no hope . 

they replaced him just fine . 

not with john goodman , he didn't do much of anything , but with the brilliant actor joe morton , who can really sing . 

the fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant , who's ten . 

this was another of my fears for the film , but he's a really good dancer , and plays a mean harmonica ( although he may have been dubbed ) . 

things that intellectually had bothered me before , like no mission from god , everyone being richer , it not being filmed in chicago -- gave me no problems at all . 

i'm quite pleased that there were less car pile-ups , because they meant less music , and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing . 

there's a few early crashes , and then one huge pile-up , but after that it all stops . 

it's just the music . 

one of my problems with the first is that cab calloway's song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him , but there's no problems with this . 

the music is all as good as ever , tons of great musicians showing up -- with the exception of johnny lang , who can't sing , all the musicians do a great job . 

the only real problems i had was the special effects . 

these were superfluous and a waste of money . 

since the film isn't doing very well , they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel , which i want to see . 

the bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide .

"the original _babe_ was my favorite movie of 1995 , a sleeper hit that transcended its target audience . 

being a surprise commercial and critical success , it had no marketing tie-ins , which limited its final take . 

thus , babe 2 arrives , with a budget greater than the money made in babe 1 . 

plush dolls , vending machines hawking t-shirts , and macy's thanksgiving day balloons arrive for holiday money-grubbing . 

too late . 

this is a sad review to write , because babe 2 not only does _not_ live up to the original , but it doesn't even come to a fraction of it . 

i shouldn't expect that sequels to modern fairy tales to match their predecessors' magic , but this film tries too hard , and loses its charm . 

consider a driver applying the accelerator with great intensity , unaware that his car is in neutral . 

imagine with me , if you will , _scream_'s jamie kennedy , explaining the "" rules "" for sequels like babe 2 . 

 ( 1 ) there must be _more_ talking animals . 

 ( 2 ) there must be _more_ slapstick comedy . 

 ( 3 ) there must be _more_ songs for those mice to sing : that's cute . 

 ( 4 ) keep the story cards to break up the action : that's cute too , even though "" the pig gets wise "" made no sense , given the context of that story partition . 

 ( 5 ) there must be action , however illogical , that will conjure up pivotal scenes from the original : the trademark song that nobody remembers the words to , the baa-ram-ewe secret code , the "" that'll do , pig . 

that'll do . "" 

now throw in the limitations : ( a ) james cromwell , now a hot commodity , has limited time on the set ( or maybe he didn't approve of the script ) . 

 ( b ) christine cavanaugh , the voice of the original babe , demands more money ( $200 , 000--paltry considering the $80 million budget ) . 

out . 

e . g . 

daily comes in with noticable results . 

 ( c ) george miller , the director , is more well-known for his dark futuristic mad max films and his twilight zone segment , not for kiddie fare ( and no , he didn't direct that _andre_ film in '94 ) . 

 ( d ) the special effects are impressive , _but limited_ . 

babe talks , but most of the time from a single shot , repeated over and over again . 

 ( babe is center screen , looking straight into the camera , with a happy smirk--regardless of whether he's happy , or scared , or tired ) . 

season now with the "" original "" elements , which , as we will find out , are straight from the screenwriting-is-hell bin . 

 ( i ) change the venue into "" the big city "" . 

this has been praised as wildly original . 

excuse me : didn't _home alone_ do this several years ago ? 

how about the muppets ? 

even _the bad news bears_ travelled to tokyo . 

sorry . 

no dice . 

side note : to give the city a fairy-tale look , george miller crafted a fantastical fantasyland that merges the landmarks of the world's great cities , and yes , it _is_ impressive . 

but this too is over-used , repeating the same view over and again on multiple occasions . 

and , for the most part , babe _remains in the hotel_ . 

 ( ii ) given the limitations of cromwell , the human element is taken over by "" the boss' wife "" played by magda szubanski . 

s-t-r-e-t-c-h . 

she's not a lead actress-type , she's not funny enough in her physical comedy , and she's simply embarrassing in some of her pratfalls . 

 ( have her arrested falsely on drug charges ! 

have her accidentally incite a riot with biker dudes and scantily clad babes ! 

have her bounce around on a bungee cord at a prestigious benefit dinner ! ) 

i was hoping for a little smirk during these scenes , but i felt sorry for the embarrassment that she put herself in . 

i am restraining myself from talking about the dark nature of the film , the violence , the scene where a pit bull dangles from the bridge , head submerged underwater . 

even the best fairy tales have a bit of the macabre in it , as the brothers grimm have demonstrated . 

no . . . my problem is with the story , or lack thereof . 

_babe_ is sent out to save the hoggett farm , but once in the city , that story is forgotten . 

being a good-natured pig in the midst of the cynicism of his environs is nice , but , other than rescue that aforementioned pit bull , what did babe actually _do_ ? 

without giving the ending away , the farm is saved from a left-field quirk that had nothing to do with the pig . 

speaking of "" pig "" , or , "" pig-pig-pig-pig-pig ! "" . 

the word "" pig "" is so overused , had they changed it to an expletive , and had the pig be al pacino , i could have been watching _scarface_ . 

this is screenwriting ? 

further , i cannot explain the deep gnaw at my gut in the many scenes where accidents happen to good people in fantastically elaborate setups . 

had it been a cartoon , and the victim be an equivalent of elmer fudd , maybe my reaction would have been softened . 

but to farmer hoggett ? 

his wife ? 

an elderly mickey rooney ? 

much too irreverent . 

 ( "" quick ! 

splice those singing mice into those scenes ! "" ) . 

the film isn't a colossal failure . 

i did like glenne headley's schmoozy chimpanzee . 

i liked the pink poodle . 

the dog on the cart , who momentarily thinks he's in dog heaven . 

and a weird looking guy who may have been doubly-cast as an airport employee and a judge . 

but most of the time , i was looking down , in boredom , or in embarrassment over the hacked-up script . 

them singing mice , those chapter partitions , the proficient acting of the animals-- none of these can compensate for a story . 

let me spoil the final scene : farmer hoggett looks at pig , proud , says "" that'll do , pig . 

that'll do . "" 

that's it . 

hope i didn't ruin it for you . 

but tell me this : what the heck did that pig _do_ ? 
"
"there's a 1 , 000-foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact . 

i'd say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies , which are getting more irwin allen- esque with every release . 

the early wave of this revival , while just as cheesy and laughable , at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes . 

deep impact tries to disguise itself as a human drama , with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking . 

the repeating cycle is as follows -- the president ( morgan freeman ) will go on tv and tell the country that there's a remote chance a comet will strike the earth , but that the nation's crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem . 

then we get to see the plan in action , in some sequence utterly lacking suspense . 

the mission will barely fail , and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth , and there's a remote chance it will strike , but that the nation's crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem . 

it goes on and on throughout the movie , but every time freeman goes on tv , we know his plan is going to fail . 

how do we know this ? 

because we've seen the tv ads for deep impact , ads that feature freeman telling the nation that "" the comet is still headed right for us "" and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading . 

ladies and gentlemen , that is the movie . 

successful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters that follow , but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its 30-second tv spots . 

television is what's wrong with deep impact . 

the main character , played by tea leoni , is a low-level broadcast journalist for msnbc ( and that's the mere tip of the product-placement iceberg ) who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy . 

she thinks it's an instance of an ex-secretary of something or other ( james cromwell ) resigning because of a mistress , and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area . 

when she goes nosing around cromwell , he begs her to keep it under wraps . 

 "" i know you're just a reporter , but you used to be a human being . "" 

she figures out what's really going on after getting roughed up by some fbi men and doing an internet search , where all good journalists learn the difference between a mistress and an extinction- level comet . 

upon a top-secret meeting with president freeman , leoni agrees to keep the story under wraps until the president can hold a press conference , at which she gets to ask the first question . 

and everyone knows , if you get to ask the first question , baby you're a star . 

leoni ends up in the anchor chair , broadcasting every step of the comet's collision course with earth . 

and i'm sure it's comforting for her to know that , even though the world's ending in a matter of months , she's a cable news personality . 

so there she is , narrating the six-astronaut mission to blow the comet up . 

such personalities as robert duvall , jon favreau and blair underwood cash their paychecks and go through the motions of this dragged-out process . 

but as anyone who's seen the commercials knows , the astronauts fail . 

they only end up breaking the comet into two pieces , which means even more destruction to the earth . 

yeah , thanks , nasa . 

that's when freeman has to come on tv for the last time and say goodbye to all the people who aren't picked to live in the missouri cave site for two years . 

they even have animals , two by two , ready to climb into the cave . 

if the focus had been on people living inside these caves after the world had been destroyed , deep impact could have been a far more interesting movie . 

instead we watch as a lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife , while people pack the highways out of town . 

the reasoning is , of course , that if a comet is going to strike , they might as well be out in some scenic rural location . 

and , amusingly , the highway is spotted with people in u-haul trucks . 

i'm sure it's comforting to know that , even though the world's ending in a matter of minutes , the u-haul people are doing the most business of their lives . 
"
"in times of crisis people are driven to desperate measures . 

of course what constitutes a crisis differs from person to person . 

what may be a disastrous situation for one , may be seen as a challenge to another . 

as deepak chopra is known to say , "" it's not the ride , it's the rider . "" 

unfortunately clear-thinking is not always the reaction to problems . 

wall street wheeler dealer steven taylor ( michael douglas ) is a man with troubles . 

he's sunk his money in illegal financial activities and it's blown up in his face . 

in a matter of days he will lose it all . 

his wife emily ( gwyneth paltrow ) is a highly-placed un interpreter and is not happy with her life either . 

her marriage is cold and unfulfilling . 

unknown to her , her new lover david shaw ( viggo mortensen ) is not only a painter , but an ex-con with a history of bilking wealthy women of their money . 

emily is a prime target : she's worth over $100 million . 

steven's solution to his predicament is to offer david half a million to kill his wife . 

the artist accepts and the movie is underway . 

drawing from frederick knott's play and loosely based on hitchcock's dial m for murder , this is all-too typical of summer releases . 

all style and no substance . 

and there's really not much style . 

director andrew davis ( the accomplished witness and best-forgotten other films ) has made exactly the wrong choices at almost every turn . 

douglas and paltrow have both shown us that they are skillful actors in previous films . 

mortensen showed promise in the past . 

here all three are walking uninterestingly through their roles with oddly waxen faces . 

the only person who shows any sense of life is david suchet as new york detective mohamed karaman . 

he's only on-screen long enough to make you think that there might be a likable person in the film and then he disappears . 

the first concern of a suspense film is to create suspense . 

surprises are important . 

in this movie the audience keeps waiting for something to happen . 

and nothing ever does . 

nearly every event is telegraphed in advance . 

close-up on this object or that action and it's easy to guess what's going to happen . 

as the film plods towards its inevitable conclusion you keep expecting a plot twist to make the movie worthwhile . 

it's a hopeless quest . 

the story doesn't make much sense . 

steven's wife is loaded . 

even with unfriendly relations , you'd think that he could have talked to her about his difficulty rather than deciding to kill her . 

when he does decide on the dire plan he makes an unreasonable choice . 

if you were going to hire someone to kill your wife , would your first choice be her lover ? 

no matter how sleazy he is , i would think there might be a chance that he would turn down the opportunity . 

why would steven plan the murder as a break-in in their apartment ? 

why not just take her out as she was walking to david's loft in a bad neighborhood ? 

while deciding among the numerous summer films , you might do well to skip this one . 

you'll find more suspense than this movie offers by watching the weather channel . 
"
"tommy lee jones chases an innocent victim around america who is trying to prove that she did not kill her spouse . 

the fugitive ? 

not quite ? this is the plot for double jeopardy , another fugitive copycat without the action , excitement , and good acting that the original had . 

there are other slight differences besides one movie being bad and the other good ; this time tommy lee jones plays a parole officer not a us marshall , clever huh ? 

oh and the fugitive ashley judd was framed by her own husband ( bruce greenwood ) who needed to collect two million dollars in life insurance money not a one armed man . 

both movies are on video . 

make the wise choice and pick the fugitive . 

there are so many flaws in double jeopardy , it is laughable . 

while serving time in prison , libby parsons ( judd ) discovers that she can never be charged for committing the same crime twice . 

learning that her husband is still alive , she decides to serve her time in prison , find him , retrieve her son , and kill her husband if necessary . 

when the strict parole officer travis lehman ( jones ) stands in her way , libby decides to break the rules ( who knows why ? ) and continue her plan , despite the fact that if she gets caught , she's going back to jail . 

director bruce beresford spends way too much time trying to convince the audience that libby misses her son . 

every other scene , we are given a shot of libby staring and crying at his picture . 

in an action movie like this , valuable time wasted on these shots takes away more opportunities for libby to get up and do something . 

all that is needed in this type of movie is a short scene in which libby tells herself or a friend "" i miss my son . "" 

nothing more , nothing less . 

dr . kimble of the fugitive didn't look at one picture of his dead wife , his primary concern was to save himself . 

libby at times shows this same determination but not nearly enough . 

ashley judd and bruce greenwood both are excellent actors but if they continue to do movies like this , they will be typecast for the rest of their careers , kind of like their doomed co-star tommy lee jones . 

winning an oscar for the fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences will never get tired of his i-do-my-job-whether-they-are-innocent-or-guilty roles . 

people still pay to see his movies and he makes plenty of money so i guess he was right . 

though i don't think he will win another oscar again . 

the ultimate mistake in the script is what eventually becomes of libby parsons . 

even if she was excused for disobeying her parole officer , the number of other crimes she commits while on the run are too numerous to count . 

burglary , assault , grand theft auto are some of libby's slipups . 

the message of the movie is you can break all of the small laws as long as you're innocent of the major crime . 

hopefully criminals won't use double jeopardy as a reference in court for why they are innocent . 

that would just be plain stupid . 
"
"if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film , it was studio 54 , the late steve rubell's infamous new york discotheque , which came to symbolize the taboo-smashing excesses of the disco era's heyday : easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone , all set to a thumping dance beat . 

so when miramax started production on _54_ last year , the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began : an edgy film as down-and-dirty as the club itself , written and directed by a promising first-timer ( mark christopher ) and starring some hot young talent ( salma hayek , neve campbell , newcomer ryan phillippe , and mike myers in his dramatic debut ) . 

my , how easily does the worm turn . 

hype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th-hour reshoots ( wrapped only a month ago ) , a rash of studio-imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew ( especially christopher ) unhappy , and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics . 

at the last minute , though , miramax did decide to screen the film ( so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers's last name was misspelled on the invitation , not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes ) for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed , myself included . 

and with good reason--somehow , some way , the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism . . . 

boring . 

although christopher has distanced himself from the finished film , he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_'s lifelessness . 

_54_ focuses , for the most part , on a tight-knit trio of employees at the club : coat check girl/aspiring disco diva anita ( a wasted hayek ) ; her busboy husband , greg ( breckin meyer ) ; and , most prominently , the fresh-from-jersey shane o'shea ( phillippe ) , who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender . 

these characters are about as generic as those descriptions . 

in focusing on the hired help , christopher really missed the boat . 

with the exception of the flamboyant , always-woozy rubell ( myers , in a well-modulated turn ) , the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers' but those of the people who went there to party ; not necessarily the numerous vip guests , but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club's famously hard-ass doormen and dance ( among other things ) the night away with the rich , famous , and infamous ( the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow's feisty dottie , a disco- and drug-crazed granny , but she's a peripheral character at best ) . 

as such , aside from the expected overhead crowd shots , there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_ . 

what is a disco film--especially one about the pinnacle of the movement--without the dancing ? 

even whit stillman's _the_last_days_of_disco_ , which wasn't so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip-to-only-themselves club-hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene . 

dancing isn't the only thing glazed over in _54_--so is the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher's fault . 

from what i've heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54's legend . 

but somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film . 

aside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane's fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored . 

shane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness , an idealistic do-gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold . 

this tacked-on "" romance "" would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience . 

they fail on both counts . 

ultimately , _54_'s failure comes down to three letters : f-u-n . 

as in , there isn't any to be had for the audience . 

too much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place . 

anyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively . 

when anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment doesn't get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film's conclusion ( one of the last-minute reshoots ) . 

strangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying . 

there is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there--two of them , in fact--but _54_ is not one of them . 

they're on cable tv : a couple of documentaries produced by e ! and vh1 . 

these two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings-on within it show that there's still a great disco movie to be made . 

the problem is , after the critical and certain box office failure of _54_ , the subject may have run its hollywood course . 
"
"not so long ago , men by the names of peckinpah , ford , leone , and eastwood made westerns . 

real westerns . 

these were some of the best films of the twentieth century . 

those days are gone . 

now we have crap like wild wild west to pass for the western . 

and that record is not improved with the unbearable tale of american outlaws . 

outlaws is yet another re-telling of the jesse james legend , courtesy of b-movie king james g . robinson ( producer of such classics as wrongfully accused and chill factor ) . 

delayed since the spring , this version stars the irish hunka hunka burning love colin farrell ( the best part of schumacher's tigerland ) as the bad-ass jesse james . 

alas , any sense of his character has been left on the ranch , leaving us with only cute chicks like ali larter ( minus the whipped cream ) to watch . 

the spin this time around : fresh from serving as southern militiamen in the civil war , jesse james ( farrell ) , his brother frank ( gabriel macht ) , and his pal cole younger ( scott caan ) lay down their arms and head home to missouri to tend the family farms after the war has ended . 

but trouble is brewing in their small town of liberty when evil railroad baron thaddeus rains ( harris yulin ) and his cronies rollin parker ( terry o'quinn ) and allan pinkerton ( timothy dalton ) demand the boys turn over their lands to the railroads . 

the jameses and the youngers then join forces to fight the railroad -- by robbing banks up and down missouri , thus cutting off the railroad's financial surplus and playing robin hood to the local people . 

along the way , the boys squabble over who's the cutest of the gang , who's the most popular cowboy in the gang , and who ought to go on mtv's total request live . 

they rob numerous banks with identical interiors , always with the kindest of hearts , strutting in their grungy dusters as moby songs play in the background . 

the witty banter they share could be plastered within a hallmark card . 

the biggest disappointment here lies in the acting of colin farrell . 

after a great job in tigerland , farrell walks through this role easier then nicolas cage in gone in 60 seconds . 

and his american accent rivals richard gere's irish accent in the jackal . 

combined with feeling like bonanza : the teen years , this homogenized production ( toned down to get the ever-popular pg-13 rating ) gives us an invincible jesse james that quickly grows tiresome and boring . 

the unbearable villains courtesy of timothy dalton and thaddeus rains spend the entire film proclaiming that everyone should be hanged , sucking out any energy left in the film . 

not to mention : the real story of jesse james and his gang bears no resemblance to the plot of american outlaws . 

instead , the movie is full of old , outrageous tales about the wild west -- tales which went out of style in 5-cent magazines about a century ago .

"it's terribly unfortunate that "" stir of echoes , "" tautly written and directed by david koepp ( who made one of 1996's unsung treasures , "" the trigger effect "" ) , should be released little more than a month after "" the sixth sense , "" which is still going strong at the box office . 

these two films are undoubtedly going to be compared ( judging from practically all of my fellow audience members last night ) , and although they have eerily similar storylines , "" stir of echoes "" is more of a straightforward psychological horror film , while "" the sixth sense "" is closer to a psychological drama . 

additionally , while "" the sixth sense "" had a shocker of an ending that undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business , "" stir of echoes "" is more conventional and predictable in its final twist . 

and where "" the sixth sense "" was disturbing , "" stir of echoes "" is just plain scary . 

i have a feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarities , and will foolishly forget to judge this film on its own respectable merits . 

adapted from a novel by richard matheson that was written some forty years ago , "" stir of echoes "" opens with a cute six-year-old boy named jake ( zachary david cope ) who is taking a bath . 

he is speaking directly at the screen , but we immediately have a feeling someone else is there . 

finally , he asks , "" does it hurt to be dead ? "" 

apparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people , but unlike "" the sixth sense , "" this young child isn't the focus of the picture . 

instead , tom witzy ( kevin bacon ) , a chicago lineman , is our protagonist . 

jake is his son , and maggie ( kathryn erbe ) , whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant , is his hard-working wife . 

one night while at a party with their closest friends , tom convinces maggie's new-age sister , lisa ( illena douglas ) , to try and hypnotize him . 

it unexpectedly works , and before long , tom is seeing things he wouldn't normally see , including a deceased teenage girl ( jenny morrison ) in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months . 

seeking help from lisa , she tells him that , while he was under hypnosis , she told him that after he awoke , his mind will remain clear and free , like an opened door . 

she didn't expect it to work , but it did , and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he sees . 

 "" stir of echoes "" isn't a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination , but in the thick , atmospheric mood it conjures up , it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror-drama , and is not only effective on a technical level , but is impressive in its portrayal of a struggling working-class family . 

kevin bacon and , especially , kathryn erbe ( 1997's "" dream with the fishes "" ) , are top-notch and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems . 

after tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions , he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house , and instead of maggie not being understanding , she instead believes what tom says , and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through , does not try to stop his pursuit . 

bacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts , and therefore , are easier to relate to and always plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet . 

in a masterfully-done , entrancing sequence , tom is hypnotized by lisa , but instead of watching him , we instead see what he sees , starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness . 

lisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater , and so , we , as audience members , are watching a movie screen from inside a theater , which is also showing a movie screen in a theater . 

telling him to move closer and closer to the screen as a fuzzy word in black letters pops up on the screen , we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is "" sleep . "" 

never before have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantly-construed as this one . 

truthfully , this set-piece , and another in which tom wakes up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt , are worth the full price of admission alone , just to see them on the big screen . 

having loads of fun with her small role as maggie's sister , lisa , illeana douglas ( 1995's "" to die for , "" her last great character ) is a delight , but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films . 

funny and enjoyably offbeat , douglas gets to utter the best line in the film : while talking to maggie about tom's visions of the girl , she remarks , "" i wouldn't be worried about him seeing another girl , although the fact that she's dead gives one pause . "" 

also of note are jenny morrison ( 1994's "" intersection "" ) , who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character , and liza weil , remarkable in 1998's "" whatever , "" as morrison's grieving teenage sister , debbie . 

if the resolution of "" stir of echoes "" does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential ( and it doesn't ) , what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty . 

the music score , by james newton howard , and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects , successfully compliment and foreshadow the off-kilter frame-of-mind that tom is put into , and director david koepp proves once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realistically-written characters . 

 "" stir of echoes "" isn't as good as "" the sixth sense , "" but why should it need to be ? 

both films are fully capable of standing on their own two feet , and "" stir of echoes "" really is a spinetinglingly good horror film . 
"
"for those interested in the true spirit of moviemaking - or what's left of it in mainstream hollywood - movie which are star vehicles are terrible things . 

as a rule , the ignore general principles of cinema because they are not made to advance the media but rather to advance the career of a particular actor . 

an actor might be chosen on the up-and-up , to give him exposure ; or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him a paycheck . 

generally , though , the actor doesn't matter , and soldier , the latest from the beleaguered warner brothers , exemplifies this : the picture lacks pizazz . 

the star for the vehicle in this case is kurt russell , otherwise known as the man of thirty words or less . 

russell plays todd , a human trained from birth in the ways of waging war and becoming emotionally distanced from the carnage he has wrought . 

the movie lets us see this degenerate process , but by the time the real plot starts , we're into todd's later years . 

he's about to be replaced by a new breed of soldiers , ones who , instead of being trained * from * birth , are genetically selected * before * birth . 

the pride of this class - caine 607 ( jason scott lee ) - will be our villain , and you know he's the villain because he has a staring contest with our hero near the movie's start . 

between the two leads , less than a full typed page of dialogue is spoken , and it's possible to imagine a script which is ninety percent stage direction . 

director paul anderson , who helmed last year's icy thriller , event horizon , doesn't show any inventiveness here and instead is content to let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam . 

todd , upon being replaced , is left to die on a garbage planet ; but in order to stretch the running time out , the villains return to the garbage planet on a "" routine patrol "" and set the stage for the final firefight . 

events are predictable from the time that the setups are made , and neither anderson nor scriptwriter david peoples attempts to show any creativeness here . 

the most annoying plot facet is the reason that the whole of the movie comes to be : todd fails to show physical superiority against caine - in fact , not even todd and two of his companions can best the baddie - but near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess with automatic weaponry . 

it's not as though todd undergoes any significant character changes throughout the plot of the story , and so the plot has a very canned feeling about it . 

the best route through this disaster is to take it lighthearted in spirit , and treat it as a parody of typical action fare , like universal soldier . 

a strict interpretation , however , reveals an unmistakeable and unforgiveable lack of style , class , or substance ; and by next year , a large percentage of the people who have seen this will have taped it off of network television . 
"
"armageddon , in itself , symbolizes everything that is wrong in modern filmmaking . 

stories have been replaced with special effects ; character development gets overshadowed by bad dialogue ; plotting consists of a bunch of shit getting blown up . 

armageddon is as stupid , as loud and as shallow as any movie you'll see come out this summer , or maybe even any other summer . 

but i loved every freaking minute of it . 

believe me , i'm just as shocked as you are . 

hell , i don't even know why i went to see it in the first place . 

the previews were so annoying that i predicted this was going to be the worst film of the year , or at least in the running . 

i'm sorry , but "" somebody dial 911 ! ! ! "" 

isn't quite the tagging that's going to sell a movie . 

it isn't too wise either to market the film using the movie's stupidest lines ( "" beam me up scotty "" - yeah , that sure is great writing . . . ) . 

i mean , let's face it ; armageddon's previews rival the truman show's as being some of the worst of the year . 

neither of them even come close to doing their respective films justice . 

of course , you all know the story . 

when the earth is threatened with total annihilation via an asteroid the size of texas , nasa calls in the us's top oil drillers ( ! ) to go into space ( ! ) and implant a nuclear device eight-hundred and someodd feet into the asteroid ( ! ) . 

in the coarse of all this mayhem , we are introduced to some interesting - and not so interesting - characters . 

belonging to the former group is rockhound ( steve buscemi ) , a horny little womanizing genius who's always full of wisecracks , even when flying into space at a huge amount of g's . 

also , there's the always cool-as-hell billy bob thornton as dan truman , the bigwig at nasa who recruits all the drillers . 

he kind of reminded me of ed harris in apollo 13 , only without the intensity and great lines to deliver . 

then on the flip side of the coin is the tired , contrived character of harry stamper ( bruce willis , who does the whole movie employing with annoying accent i can't quite place ) , the leader of the pack as well as liv tyler and ben affleck as the token lovers you must have in any summer movie . 

basically , that's about it . 

as i said , this is hardly a film about plot . 

it's another summer blockbuster with plot points that are beyond unbelievable and dialogue and characters that are mostly completely wooden . 

case in point : nasa doesn't know that there is even an asteroid on it's way until eighteen days before impact - huh ? 

another example : at one point in the movie , two children are playing with toy space shuttles in front of a poster of kennedy . 

how pretentious is that ? ? ? ! ! ! 

want another one ? 

okay ; before the oil drillers blast off into space , one of them starts singing "" leaving on a jet plane "" , and soon , all the rest join in . 

did michael bay attend the school of sappy filmmaking before he made this picture ? 

but naturally , all this sappiness , melodrama and special effects accumulate to one bitchin' time at the movies . 

and don't get me wrong - despite all of the things i found wrong with armageddon , i still very much enjoyed it . 

so even if you don't win one of mcdonald's free tickets , it's still definitely worth checking out .

">from the man who presented us with henry : the portrait of a serial killer ( 6 . 5/10 ) 

comes a wild tale set within the elite and white trash of florida's south coast . 

plot : guidance counselor ( dillon ) is accused of raping one of his students . 

she happens to be the daughter of one of the wealthiest women in florida . 

the counselor is brought to court on the charges , as another white trash girl ( campbell ) , also joins the rape finger-pointing club . 

as the story unfolds , we find that many things aren't exactly as they seem ( that's as much as i could say without ruining anything ) . 

critique : good little flick that slows down at certain points , and runs a tad long , but generates enough twists and turns to keep most people interested throughout . 

mind you , i could see many people not liking it because it takes "" one too many "" twists and turns , but hey , i happen to like that kind of thing . 

and besides , the twists and turns in this movie managed to remain within the realm of believability ( or scathingly close to ) , and even "" explained "" many of its turns with a showcase of missed scenes during the credit crawl at the end of the film ( do not leave the theatre before you see the credits . . . it 

really does clear up some stuff ! ! ) . 

other than that , the acting was good , with campbell transforming her "" good girl stereotypical "" role into a pot-smoking , goth-looking white trash chick out for a good time . 

denise richards ( from starship troopers ( 7/10 ) fame ) solidifies herself as hollywood's jelly-donut pinup girl of the moment , and proves that all breast implants needn't lead to lawsuits . 

bacon is solid , and so is dillon ( while continuing to prove his inability to age to the whole wide wondering world ! ! ) . 

sprinkle the story with a bunch o' shots of alligators peeking through the swamp waters , bacon showing the world the size of his ding-dong ( do we really need to see this ? ? ) , a couple of lesbian kissing scenes , and a menage-a-trois , and you've got yourself a decent time at the movie theatre . 

on the down side , the soundtrack was not as prominent ( or slick ) as i thought it would be , and theresa russell ( real name : theresa paup ) seems to have lost her way in every which way possible . . . . ooooh , 

i almost forgot bill murray's exquisite role as the down-trodden lawyer who agrees to defend dillon in court . 

murray actually added that extra little spice of humour that allowed this film to affirm its position as a quirky little noirish tale of sex , greed and mystery . 

little known facts : neve campbell specified a non-nudity clause in her contract ( she's also born in guelph , ontario . . . go 

hoser ! ) 

director john mcnaughton says he deleted a scene that would have shown matt dillon and kevin bacon showering together , as it was gratuitous . 

kevin bacon plays in a band with his brother , called the bacon brothers , is married to actress kyra sedgwick , and has a game based on him called "" six degrees of kevin bacon "" .

"claire danes , giovanni ribisi , and omar epps make a likable trio of protagonists , but they're just about the only palatable element of the mod squad , a lame-brained big-screen version of the 70s tv show . 

the story has all the originality of a block of wood ( well , it would if you could decipher it ) , the characters are all blank slates , and scott silver's perfunctory action sequences are as cliched as they come . 

by sheer force of talent , the three actors wring marginal enjoyment from the proceedings whenever they're on screen , but the mod squad is just a second-rate action picture with a first-rate cast . 
"
"the catch phrase for disney's rocket man is one spoken by fred z . randall ( harland williams ) , the bumbling idiot computer programmer turned astronaut who continuously wreaks havoc everywhere he goes . 

 "" it wasn't me ! "" he proclaims over and over as the aftermath of his stupidity brings about looks of disgust from the others . 

well when it comes to this movie being as horrible as it is , williams can't take all the blame , but he sure can't justify himself with his own simple tag line either . 

fred has dreamed of space travel since he was a young boy , turning the clothes dryer into a mock space shuttle and staring out wide-eyed at a poster of the earth . 

as a 30-year-old , fred hasn't grown up much , but at least he's somewhat closer to his goal , now designing astronaut software for nasa . 

when an astronaut for an upcoming mission to mars becomes injured , nasa calls on the person who knows the programming inside and out to fill the void . 

 . 

 . 

fred . 

yes , although he's an obviously klutzy moron , nasa doesn't think twice about throwing him into a rigorous training program so he can assist one of the most important events the space program , and time itself , has ever known . 

for the first part of the film , we watch as fred takes on the training program much like an amusement park . he laughs , he screams , but he never once breaks a sweat or views the preparation as anything more than child's play . 

his passive approach to the program eventually leads to many record-breaking feats , much to the dismay of cocky counterpart , mission commander captain overbeck ( william sadler ) , who once held the records . 

overbeck will regretfully accompany fred and two others to the red planet , one being astronaut julie ford ( the stupids' jessica lundy ) , and the other being a chimpanzee who is much more civilized than our antagonizing protagonist . 

from here on out , we are subjected to one lame gag after another , dealing with snot , laxatives , and flatulence . 

you know , standard kid movie material . 

almost sounding like a poor james stewart impressionist , williams is awful in his first starring role . 

we get the feeling that if jerry lewis and pee-wee herman were related and produced an inbred offspring , williams would be it . 

while he's not as annoying as other actors who cater to zany , stupid comedy , he's just as unlikeable . 

to say it more understandably , jim carrey might annoy you more , but this guy is even less funny . 

why ? 

because while he possesses the stupidness needed to pull off such a role , his performance is too understated and boring . 

classic comedic dunces were generally oblivious to their own idiocy . 

stan laurel , for example , was so innocent in all his trouble-making that we were immediately fond of him . 

peter sellers , as inspector clouseau , was so self-assured and confident that when he did something as simple as trip , it was humor at it's best . 

williams , on the other hand , can't garner the pity he needs to make us love him in all his anti-glory . 

as for the rest of the cast , including some bigger names in smaller roles ( beau bridges and shelley duvall ) , nobody is worth watching whatsoever . 

this is just another example of the fast-food equivalent of cinema : mass-produced , less than mediocre , over priced , and hard to stomach . 

giving it one-and-a-half stars is * extremely * generous , but even i'll admit to laughing a few times . 

the amazing thing is that even in a theater packed with little kids , laughter was something rarely heard - even from the children ! 

i must admit that it gave me more respect for the kids when they didn't crack up over every little thing . 

then again , maybe they were asleep . 

some people might think critics are harsh on kid movies , claiming adults aren't the targeted audience and therefore aren't meant to , and won't , enjoy them . 

sadly , it's also true that kids will enjoy almost anything if it's presented right . 

a two-hour still shot of a dog with a cartoonish voice over could entertain a lot of toddlers out there , but would that make it as artistic as beauty and the beast , which could easily do the same thing ? 

and saying that a parent's perspective isn't important is quite a poor theory to have when they're the ones who take the kids to these films in the first place .

"harmless , silly and fun comedy about dim-witted wrestling fans gordie and sean ( david arquette and scott caan ) who idolize current world championship wrestling heavyweight champion jimmy king ( oliver platt ) . 

when king is screwed out of his title by a corrupt promoter ( joe pantoliano ) , gordie and sean take it upon themselves to find their fallen hero and restore his glory . 

my biggest fear about ready to rumble was dispatched early on , as the filmmakers are quick to show that wresting is indeed choreographed ( but not fake , mind you ) . 

the hook of the movie is that gordie and sean are just too stupid to realize that . 

arquette and caan are suitably over the top with their performances , which is exactly what a movie like this requires , and oliver platt ( one of my favorite actors ) is a riot as the drunken washed-up ex-champion . 

many have scoffed at the idea that platt should be playing a heavyweight champion wrestler with an unbeaten record , but for me it just added to the "" silly factor "" of the film , thereby increasing my enjoyment of it . 

one casting complaint however : rose mcgowan as a sexy dancer ? 

please . . . 

if rose mcgowan is sexy then i'm marilyn manson . 

given the current state of the actual wcw , if oliver platt were appearing as jimmy king right now on wcw programming , he'd be the most popular guy they have . 

on a similar note , the "" plot line "" of the wresting portions of the film are more entertaining than anything the wcw writers have been able to come up with in the last two years . 

although one does have to ask . . . 

why would any wrestling promoter fire the head wrestler of a company who is both unbeaten and extremely popular with the fans ? 

director brian robbins ( you'll remember him as eric from tv's "" head of the class "" ) just knows how to make good dumb movies . 

this movie fits in nicely with his previous efforts good burger and varsity blues . 

and screenwriter steven brill ( the epic mighty ducks trilogy , late last night ) manages to keep things both sophomoric and clever at the same time , with almost all the jokes of the film getting a laugh out of me . 

the only exceptions to that were : 1 ) a scene involving a van full of singing nuns and 2 ) any scene involving the old woman wrestling fan . 

those moments made me cringe and/or groan . 

as an added bonus though , the audience is treated to outtakes from the film as the final credits roll .

"i don't appreciate it when a thriller manipulates the viewer into thinking the plot is interesting , when in fact it's ludicrous . 

in the case of the general's daughter , the plot is more than capable of intriguing you to a certain point . 

but at this juncture in the story , the movie begins to fall apart like a crumbling cookie . 

this predictable summer thriller is only sporadically involving , and that is unfortunately not enough to compensate for all of it's detailed flaws . 

get past one moment early on where john travolta exercises his southern accent , and you're likely to survive this entire movie . 

travolta plays criminal investigations divisions officer paul brenner , who's working undercover at a military base when another situation arises : the apparent rape and murder of a young female officer ( leslie stefanson ) . 

it turns out that the victim is the daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) . 

let the investigation begin . 

with the assistance of fellow cid investigator sarah sunhill ( played rather on-the-sidelines by madeleine stowe ) , brenner uncovers what appears to be an intricate and bizarre homicide case . 

things begin to get marginally engrossing when we meet colonel moore ( james woods ) , a former commanding officer of the deceased who has a few secrets up his sleeve . 

woods submits another scene-stealing performance here as he oozes authority , surrounded by clouds of smoke emitted from his cigar . 

with echoes of his supporting role in true crime , in which he duked it out with clint eastwood in enjoyably profane verbal exchanges , he makes every moment believable . 

here though , the intense dialogue comes care of confrontations with travolta , as the two send mindful , knowing glares across the room . 

there are many scenes such as this in the general's daughter , in which the veteran cast performs splendidly under pressure , but the circumstances that tie these meetings together are difficult to absorb . 

director simon west ( con air ) , shows a watchful eye of delivering a stylish looking thriller , but he fails miserably when it comes to the intellectual part of it . 

the general's daughter is , more often than not , a predictable and unexciting mess . 

it does not help matters that the plot is virtually actionless , dragging it's heels all the way at a mind-numbing snails pace . 

a few brief action scenes , marvelously handled in the editing department , show that the movie could have delivered such a more proficient package . 

from a director who does such a great job of staging explosions and miraculous stunts , i suggest west should stick with mindless , rip-roaring action features and attempt to avoid future projects like this . 

still , the movie is certainly not without it's merits . 

the acting is very good from the majority of the experienced cast . 

the performances range from commanding ( travolta ) to electric ( woods ) to stiff-as-a-board ( cromwell , who doesn't show off his real talents here ) . 

madeleine stowe manages to hold her own for a while , but as the female lead in an action-thriller , she doesn't pull through sufficiently . 

one of the problems with the execution is that it's very predictable . 

>from minute one , i had few doubts about the identity of the killer in question . 

the script even unwillingly points him out for us , using familiar techniques to hide his guilt until the unmasking toward the end . 

in all fairness , we've seen many of the devices used in the general's daughter put to greater effect in other films . 

the secrets behind the girl's mysterious death are explained gradually , but by the resolution we have tunneled through so much malarkey that it feels unnecessary and surprisingly silly . 

the general's daughter is not a terrible movie , and it is involving enough to sustain a viewer's attention span for a certain period of time . 

but it just could have been so much better . 
"
"even if i did not know that director and co-writers james wong and jeffrey reddick of the creepy final destination helped create the hit television show the x-files , i would have inevitably made a connection . 

the similarities are very apparent from the inexplicable phenomenon- like plot , to the mysterious characters , to the overall dark , ominous settings . 

it would have been perfectly fitting to see fbi agents mulder and scully investigate this case , they witness stuff like this on a weekly basis ( in fact mulder and scully would have been a much more welcome change to the bland one dimensional fbi agents seen in this movie ) . 

another more important similarity , is that both succeed in entertaining and thrilling at the same time . 

this is a great accomplishment for a teen horror movie , especially when compared to some of the trash , of the same genre , released in the last couple of years ( urban legend and i still know what you did last summer are classic examples from the bunch ) . 

what helps final destination is its unique premise . 

unlike your average horror flick in which some invincible psycho with a knife chases blonde cheerleaders , the villain presented is unusual , it's the grim reaper . 

this being already has predestined when and how you will die . 

according to the brief history lesson given in this film , everyone was meant to die at a certain time , some people at 100 , others at 17 , whatever death chooses . 

what is unique about death is that it's already dead , so you can't really kill it . 

the only way to defeat death is to cheat it ; the question is how do you do that ? 

this dilemma is what faces alex and a group of teenagers . 

alex has been having some dreams that the airplane which will take his class on a trip to paris will crash , leaving no survivors . 

alex begins to realize that his dreams are a little too real and eventually gets himself and six others kicked off the plane right before it takes off . 

shortly after , the plane does indeed crash leaving some of the seven survivors confused and others feeling immortal . 

however , death isn't through with them yet . 

it gradually kills off the seven one by one , leaving those currently still alive frantically trying to trick death again . 

the plot allows for some of the most creative , original death scenes i have seen in a while . 

some scenes build up the perfect amount of tension until an elaborate climax , others are so unexpected they will leave your jaw wide open in shock . 

creativity and originality are two adjectives lacking in most horror films nowadays but final destination is not like most horror films . 

sure , it has your traditional share of jerks and outsiders ( ali larter's character is particularly annoying ) , but the shocks , from the beginning to the end , are extremely entertaining . 

also director wong has the sense not to take the movie too seriously . 

he knows its just another entertaining guilty pleasure that won't win any academy awards ( not even a golden globe ) . 

the myriad of inside jokes and gags ( the characters are named after famous horror directors , one character who plays a jerk is named carter , like x-files creator chris carter , and a song by john denver , who died in a plane crash , plays whenever death is near ) show this movie is a bunch of guys having a good time making a movie . 

and from this , i had a great time watching the movie . 
"
"this is your definitive "" hollywood "" movie , extremely predictable , following the basic formula ( a horrible ending ) , overzealous writing ( meaning the writing was bad and seemed as if it were trying too hard to make it exciting , therefore making it look as if many things were merely tossed in there to fill space ) and if tommy lee jones and his lovable wise-ass character ( of which we've seen before in the fugitive and quite frankly , wasn't used enough here ) , i'm afraid the film would have been completely unbearable . 

in this film , ashley judd plays a women who is wrongfully convicted of killing her husband while out sailing for a weekend . 

while in jail she finds out that her husband really is alive and that he framed the murder on her . 

over money ( how original ) . 

while in jail she works out , exercises and basically does her best to get into near perfect condition . 

now she has learned about a law titled "" double jeopardy "" stating that if she serves her full sentence and get out she could kill her husband and the law could not touch her ( although there has been talk that this is not the way the actual law works ) . 

now her po ( parole officer ) , and a bunch of cops are chasing after her and are conflicted whether or not to believe her claims . 

skipping over to the acting : the fact that judd is more of a looker than an actress ( no offense , she has been good [simon birch] and even very good to great [kiss the girls] at times , in the past and i believe may have the potential to be better . . . 

but she's terribly unconvincing in this and her performance seems stale and unsatisfying ) doesn't really add to the movie at all ; just takes away . 

as i'd said , jones was fine , although he did not have much to work with . 

he was much more of a supporting character . 

which is fine , and he handled it well ; especially considering the material he had to work with . 

i feel this film had alot going for it . 

originality not being an issue . 

the acting was the only thing ( as i said ) keeping it alive . 

the plot seemed pretty intriguing and could have been as well if applied better . 

the action scenes were well made ( however sometimes out of place ) . 

i was just left unsatisfied in the long run . 

so basically some of the action may have been exciting but genuinely over-thought , the plot has certainly been done before ( generally speaking ) , the movie moves way too fast for us to get involved in either the characters or the plot , and is basically a film that was almost saved by tommy lee jones , who if he had some more screentime , could perhaps have earned the film a higher rating ; in my book , anyway . 

keep this in mind , if you're in the mood for a good action film -- rent the fugitive .

"oliver stone's latest feature is the last one standing in the long line of biographies of american presidents . 

it's a three-hour long saga about the life of one of the most hated and misunderstood leaders of the 20th century . 

stone doesn't hold back anything as he digs deep inside politics and legal maneuvers of the white house . 

the director holds nixon responsible for everything he has done . 

at the same time he creates a very human character , a brilliant and tortured man that is caught in the dirty game of politics , which is here pictured as a wild animal . 

he is simply trying to tame it . 

but the occasional switch to the raging sky and the clouds swiftly fleeing over the white house as events run ahead of the president's ability to control them . 

stone doesn't in any way apologize for nixon . 

he blames not only nixon's own character flaws but also the imperial presidency itself , the system that , once set in motion , behaves with a mindlessness of its own . 

 "" nixon "" is a modern shakespeare story - a saga about a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws . 

there's something almost majestic about the process : as nixon goes down in this film , there is no gloating , but a watery sigh , as of a great ship sinking . 

sir anthony hopkins is staggering and plays nixon with incredible honesty and understanding , creating a very emotional picture of the 37th american president . 

joan allen's magnificent and captivating performance is certainly worth an oscar statuette . 

she is strong and loyal as mrs . nixon . 

the rest of the cast is equally magnificent , including : james woods , j . t . walsh , paul sorvino , ed harris and bob hoskins . 

everyone does a serious and demanding job , no one are disappointing . 

stone never loses focus and his direction is steddy , honest and determined . 

he is displaying the historical facts and at the same time concentrating at the human element . 

at times he is showing to black and white showing flashbacks from nixon's youth and childhood . 

the flashy editing by brian berdan and frank corwin , robert richardson's rich cinematography and john williams' musical score create a hectic and bizarre atmosphere . 

the film's only fault is that it's a bit tiering and overloaded with too much political material and legal maneuvers . 

still it's an honest and captivating - a solid piece of movie making .

"eyes wide shut isn't the masterpiece many were hoping to see in stanley kubrick's final film , but it is an impressive achievement ; a mesmerizing , haunting , adult psychodrama about marriage , fidelity and sex . 

it's a stanley kubrick film from beginning to end , consistently exhibiting the auteur's trademark penchant for long , continuous takes , his unparalleled deftness behind the camera and his uncanny ability to extract gorgeous performances from his exhausted cast ( indeed , eyes wide shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously laborious shoot : kubrick , a renowned perfectionist , reportedly held his cast "" hostage "" on the set for nearly a year ) . 

in an uncharacteristic maneuver , kubrick cast two big-name stars in the lead roles , namely real-life husband and wife tom cruise and nicole kidman . 

they play bill and alice harford , a volatile couple who , during the course of a couple nights , ponder the validity of the idea that a husband and a wife must be faithful to each other . 

he is an m . d . , she's unemployed and we are introduced to them as they are getting ready to go to a fancy party . 

at the affair , they are both propositioned and both nearly succumb to the temptation to play around with someone else . 

when they return to their lavish new york apartment kidman ( after smoking a dash of weed ) inquires whether her husband had sex with two models who approached him during the night . 

he ( truthfully ) says that he did not and asks what happened with that hungarian guy she was dancing with . 

they proceed to argue until alice tells her spouse a lustful story : evidently some time ago , she had a thing for a young naval officer . 

she admits that she was ready to give up her whole future with bill and their young daughter if this guy wanted her even for one night . 

bill is jolted by alice's story and we anticipate his reaction , but at that moment he gets a phone call and has to go "" show his face "" at the house of a just-deceased patient . 

this turns out to be the beginning of a long and eventful night on the town . 

the daughter of the dead patient hits on him but he wisely turns her down . 

he almost does the dirty deed with a kindly hooker who approaches him on the street . 

then , through a series of coincidences , he winds up at a gothic mansion where a ritualistic ( and frankly , creepy ) orgy takes place , with costumed people performing various public sex acts on each other . 

erotic dread mounts as cruise ( who's not supposed to be there ) wonders the spacious halls watching the "" action "" until he is discovered to be an outsider . 

much hoopla has been raised over the fact that warner bros . digitally edited the orgy scene . 

with the help of a computer , they put in cloaked figures to block some of the actual sex acts ( they can still be seen , just not in all their glory ) in order to avoid the dreaded nc-17 rating . 

european viewers will see the film as kubrick envisioned it . 

roger ebert calls the american version the "" austin powers version , "" and many others have bashed the alterations . 

i am of the potentially controversial opinion that the figures only supplement the scene's mystical atmosphere . 

the first thing one notices about eyes wide shut is how it looks . 

this is an artful , distinctively gorgeous production , shot in dark , moody hues and featuring some elaborate , beautiful scenery . 

from the giant mansion used in the film's centerpiece to the decor at the christmas party to the harford's apartment , this film is always a pleasure to look at . 

to boot , a great soundtrack makes it more atmospheric still . 

at the core , behind the graphic , controversial content and unappealing mood , this is a good-natured movie that emphasizes the importance of fidelity . 

it looks at sex as almost perfunctory by portraying it as unnerving rather than erotic . 

it's something superficial and yet something necessary to achieve a deeper relationship . 

at the end , it seems , bill's eyes are wide open to the special kind of love he and his wife have for each other , more meaningful than anything he could ever hope to find on the streets of new york . 

kubrick elicits wonderful performances from both cruise and kidman . 

tom is completely convincing as dr . harford , a man who seems guided solely by destiny , with no control of the course his life will take . 

nicole projects a quiet intensity as the jittery yet aggressive wife and her performance is stunningly effective : she's headed for an oscar nod . 

the movie has some help from a similarly strong supporting cast , at the head of which is director-cum-thespian sidney pollock , enigmatic and articulate as harford's mysterious friend . 

eyes wide shut is not perfect : the last hour could have used a slightly more scissor-happy editor and both cruise and kidman are too good- looking for me to believe that either would have a very strong temptation to philander . 

still , this is an important work from a great director , and while it may not be on par with some of stanley kubrick's best it is a worthy final film , a complex exploration of jealousy and faithfulness .

" "" love is the devil "" is a challenging film , munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot , perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artist's psyche rather than the artist's lifeline . 

watching it , i was enthralled with the look of the film , the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre , personalized filter . 

everything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon , the film's subject , looked at it personally . 

but while i was engrossed , i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film , awakened from my trance by some inner distraction , and began to try and follow what's going on . 

exactly what was i looking at ? 

watching this film , i wasn't sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous . 

directed ( and written ) by john maybury , "" love is the devil "" is stylish masterpiece for the senses . 

everything looks originally bizarre and perplexing . 

the camera angles are ferociously askew , and the close-ups are uncomfortably too close . 

the editing is deft , occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds , but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs , or rather , intruders to bacon's world and psyche . 

as such , there is no real story . 

i've not heard much about francis bacon that i didn't read prior to the film , but what i learned was this : he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s , drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like . 

he was one of the first to really come out of the closet , and in interviews , he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty . 

as played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi , he's like a foppish and self-absorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero . 

he lives life the way he wants to live it , to the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him . 

it's as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself ( "" champagne for my real friends , and pain for my sham friends , "" he says one night at the bar he frequents ) . 

 "" love is the devil "" chronicles the latter part of his life . 

bacon , well-known in his mid-life , awakens one night when he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor . 

he walks in , unafraid of what he finds , and discovers a thief , george dyer ( daniel craig ) . 

bacon gives him an offer : if he spends the night with him , he can take anything he wants in the morning . 

george agrees to this , and off to bed he goes , but ends up staying with him , for whatever reason . 

the film shows their lives together , at least in reference to one another . 

while creating bacon's world of friends ( like "" high art , "" this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that is not shown but is understood ) , the film shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant . 

bacon is haughty and bizarre ; george is simple and doesn't understand bacon in the least , especially not his paintings . 

while watching this , that's basically all i thought was there . 

the film has a hypnotic feel , free of any restraints of form , and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about . 

once the film is over , it's easier to piece it together . 

i kept on thinking about this film , wondering what the point to all of it was . 

someone doesn't merely make a film of all style and no substance at all , and if they do , they do it by accident , but still allow some substance to creep in . 

thinking about it , i remembered how the two fed off of eachother . 

i thought about how bacon was a masochist , in love with cruelty ( in one scene , he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic delight , and lets out a squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxer's head splashes across his face ; in another scene , he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisenstein's "" battleship potemkin "" ) , and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain . 

he drove him over the edge , and for him that was love , even if it wasn't for george . 

i guess that explains the title . 

a bit . 

that's great and all , but i almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning . 

i wish it hadn't reduced itself to making some point about humanity , about how love is the most selfish thing in the world ( and it is , if you look at it a certain way ) . 

or maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one man's twisted pysche . 

it's almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one man's uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audience's throat . 

that way you don't reduce your film to something it's just not . 

i can't say i totally enjoyed "" love is the devil , "" though . 

despite all of the things i respect about this movie , it's still rather uncomfortable to sit through . 

even at a normally trite length of ninety minutes , the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through , especially after an exhausting first hour . 

though hypnotic , it still almost seems gimmicky and even redundant at times , as if it were taking advantage of one man's truly bizarre nature but not doing anything deeper with it . 

as such , i respect the way the film looks . 

it's beautiful and painstakingly crafted so that , along with "" what dreams may come "" and "" dark city , "" it's the year's most visually stunning film . 

in fact , if a better script had been forged , i'd almost compare it in visual power to a peter greenaway film , complete with similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever . 

and with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi , it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs . 

i just wish it had been more than mostly style and just a hair bit of substance . 

then i would have had something to hold me over even now .

"a silly film that tries to be a black comedy but plays more like lightweight comedy , with its main asset being a beautiful film location along spain's mountainous coastline . 

howard pigeon ( jeff goldblum ) is a 40-year-old mineral water salesman who is married for 13 years to a wife constantly nagging him , elizabeth ( mimi rogers ) . 

after a surprise birthday party for him , where his wife bawls him out for coming late to his surprise party , he confides to his best friend that he can't stand it anymore , and then tells him his plan to kill her while vacationing in the same barcelona hotel where they spent their honeymoon . 

jeff is going through a severe mid-life crises , worried that he looks older than his age . 

he incessantly talks to himself , mostly agonizing over his bitter marriage and chastising himself why he went out with elizabeth for a second time , and then why he married her just because she laughed at his jokes and was attractive . 

he stutters and acts like a man who has lost his confidence . 

things change on their vacation , as elizabeth makes an effort to be nice while jeff now becomes the grouch . 

he nervously rehearses his murder plan in the hotel room . 

by accident the gun goes off and into the pillow where he imagined elizabeth would be sitting . 

when other hotel guests and staff come to check about the gunshot , he nervously explains that it was the tv . 

realizing how unworkable his plan is , he places the gun in the shattered pillow and throws it into the ocean while he waits for elizabeth . 

but elizabeth found his behavior odd during the entire trip , and when after a great deal of effort to get a reservation at the hotel's 5 star restaurant he insists on eating in the room , she decides she had enough of him and checks out without telling him . 

as a result , he goes to the police to report her missing . 

while with the police , a telegram comes from his wife saying she left him and is going away because she wants to be alone . 

his boss and all those he works with are sympathetic to him , and he gets a job promotion . 

but soon the pillow with the gun is fished out of the water , giving the police cause to arrest him and search his home . 

there they find letters he has written incriminating him to the murder . 

the police also find out from the hotel staff about the gunshot heard in his room . 

in jail , things look bad for him . 

no one believes him , including his friends and lawyer . 

his boss fires him and the papers have a field day with the headline story : pigeon : a jailbird . 

out on bail , he realizes that his only hope is to track down his wife . 

through a call placed on his credit card , he tracks her down to a mountain resort . 

once there he learns that she took a hike up the steep mountain and he gets a priest to be his mountain guide after telling him the true story . 

the film is watchable just for the antics of the jeff goldblum comic performance . 

he is someone coming apart by the seams , while mimi rogers is his perfect foil . 

it was mostly pantomine humor , with the comedy charged in the changing facial expressions of the characters and the absurdity of the situation . 

a very minor farce that might appeal to the sitcom crowd . 

the film just didn't take its situation seriously and the story had many gaps in it , so it had no chance for black humor to develop . 

it instead played its set-up of the henpecked husband acting out his fantasy strictly for entertainment value to see how many chuckles it could draw . 
"
"the thought-provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of "" leila , "" a powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui , that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirty-year career to gain u . s . distribution , thanks to first run features . 

although unfamiliar with mehrjui's previous directing efforts , perhaps the reason for this is that , while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country , the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers . 

set in modern-day iran , "" leila "" begins on the birthday of the title character ( leila hatami ) , after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband , reza ( ali mosaffa ) . 

as leila and reza set off to visit his parents , and then hers , where a birthday celebration has been planned , things seem rosy for the couple on the outside , but for leila , life isn't quite as sweet . 

earlier , on that very same day , leila had gone to see her physician , and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child . 

when all of the conditions are ruled out , and leila passes up the possibility of adoption , reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her , and doesn't care at all about having children . 

nonetheless , leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby , which is the societal norm , and her self-esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother-in-law ( jamileh sheikhi ) , whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news ( reza is her only son ) . 

bluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and , in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition , she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with . 

leila hesitantly agrees , and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens' inadequacies , reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like , even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesn't give her full blessing . 

there are no easy answers to be found within "" leila , "" a film that thoughtfully examines the central character's unfortunate plight , as well as the inner workings of leila herself , told through matter-of-fact narration . 

almost completely taken over by her own shame , she has no option but to agree to her forceful mother-in-law's requests , even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman . 

maybe because "" leila "" is from iran , the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences , since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence . 

leila , however , is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily , but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy , no matter what the circumstances . 

one of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza , who married only three months after their first meeting , but obviously love each other very deeply . 

it is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful , and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible . 

although seemingly unimportant at first glance , an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing , nearly uncontrollably , actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half , as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another . 

ditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday , and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her . 

these "" small "" moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn , outraging sequences in the latter half , in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road , and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman . 

left there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage , foolishly unbeknownst to reza , leila prays each time that the date will not go well , so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer . 

refusing to stay over at her parent's house , the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman , and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency , leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart , as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below . 

despite her initial agreement to such a thing , leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza , whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him . 

sure , the whole second marriage was his mother's idea , but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children , then he could have still easily backed out , couldn't he ? 

in the pivotal role of leila , who appears in every scene , leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable , injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength , unavoidable vulnerability , and utter despair . 

unlike most american films , in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences , hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words . 

every bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa , as reza , a man who , i believe , does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife , but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else . 

for all of its strong aspects , "" leila "" isn't a perfect film . 

on a technical level , i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed . 

and concerning the plot developments , the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before . 

mehrjui's decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice , particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful mother-in-law , played memorably by jamileh sheikhi . 

despite these minor missteps , "" leila "" is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may 16 release at new york's cinema village , and then on may 21 in la . 

the thought-provoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales , and when the climax arrives , leila's self-worth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete devastation , to which there is no return . 

it's difficult to not consider how leila's culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided , had the other characters taken a second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila , the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme , was going through .

"meet joe black ( reviewed on nov . 27/98 ) 

starring brad pitt , anthony hopkins , claire forlani 

in "" meet joe black "" , brad pitt plays death . 

that's all that really needs to be said , but nevertheless , i will provide the three of you that have seemingly been living in a cave with a plot description . 

death decides to take a holiday , what with all the rigors of soul-collecting and all , and forces anthony hopkins into showing him what it's like to be human . 

death assumes the body of brad pitt , and from there , much trouble ensues . 

for one thing , death-as-pitt falls in love with hopkins daughter , played by claire forlani . 

obviously this enrages hopkins , because really , what can death offer ? 

besides eternal damnation , of course . 

there is also a sub-plot about forlani's ex-boyfriend ( she dumps him for pitt ) trying to take over hopkins company . 

 "" meet joe black "" runs just under three hours . 

i've always thought that such obscene running times should be limited to historical epics . 

 "" meet joe black "" is neither historical nor is it an epic , though i get the feeling martin brest ( the director ) desperately wants it to be . 

every single scene in the movie goes on about 3-4 minutes too long . 

and the ending takes about 20 minutes longer than it really should . 

a severe editing job could have made this movie excellent , instead of just good , which is what it is . 

pitt , an actor i normally loathe , is actually quite engaging as death . 

i believed his performance , and i could see why forlani's character would fall in love with him . 

i have to agree with roger ebert , though , who found it hard to believe that an entity that's been around for all time wouldn't know what peanut butter was . 

that has nothing to do with pitt's performance , of course , but it is a little distracting . 

hopkins gives his usual excellent performance . 

he's able to portray the angst of a man who knows he has very little time left , without making him an obnoxious whiner . 

and in her first major studio role , claire forlani is surprisingly good . 

she has a sweet tenderness that allows the audience to instantly root for her . 

so , "" meet joe black "" is a good movie hampered by it's ridiculous running time . 

had the film been cut by an hour or so , i have no doubt that i would be calling it one of the best movies of the year in this review . 
"
"so i went and saw this film right , it was called "" battlefield : earth "" , i was never interested in the previews , and never too terribly interested in the book , nor do i find scientology interesting , but after reading advanced reviews of how bad this film really is , i had that weird urge just to watch it . 

well let me be the first to say , and so far in my view it's safe to say : battlefield : earth might be the worst film i have ever seen , yes even worse than "" mr . magoo "" , "" blue in the face "" , or "" jaws : the revenge "" . 

roger christianson whos credits include set direction , and art direction for such great films as "" alien "" and "" star wars "" , directs this film with such amateurism , that the film looks and feels and in fact sounds so dumb , that it's quite depressing . 

the look of the film , is dark and drabby at times , but then bright and happy at other times . 

the sound is terrible , and has the worst surround sound effects i've heard . 

the acting is nothing , the dialogue poor , and the make-up effects hideous . 

here's the so-called plot : earth 3000 . . . . man is a endangered species , while aliens from the planet psychlo ( the aliens are named psychlo . . . i 

wonder why ? ! ) are invading earth , destined to put an end to those "" man-animals "" to an end , and destroy earth once and for all , of course we have our typical hero ( played terrible by barry pepper , who was great in a small role in 1999's "" the green mile "" ) who is destined to go out , and save his planet ! 

one thing : he has to go up against , terl , the chief of security psychlo , who is played frankly , quite bad by john travolta , whom with dreadlocks , a big head , and green eyes just doesn't work . 

of course the sidekick to terl , is played by ( lol ! ! ) 

forest whitaker , who looks like a deformed werewolf of some kind . 

our friendly human johnny ( barry pepper ) looks just as bad as well , with long scraggly hair . 

i'm not really sure how to quite explain the badness of this film , except just to say it's terrible . 

everything in this film is imcomprehinsable , from the make-up effects , which by the way aren't good , to the phony looking special effects , everything in this film is faulted . 

in fact i don't remember one part in this entire movie where i was having a good time , or enjoying myself . 

in fact there is no part in the movie that i liked or enjoyed . 

throughout the entire 127 minute running time , i was dying , constantly looking at my watch , and hoping maybe the projectioner would blow a bulb or something , sadly it didn't . 

my advice to hollywood : get new scripts , new acting classes , better directors and damnit , make films like american beauty more .

"the long and illustrious career of robin williams , which has included both forgettable turns like mrs . 

doubtfire and flubber , was punctuated with the actor's first academy award in 1998 for his role in good will hunting . 

it was his first truly dramatic role since 1989's dead poets society , and critical remarks were unanimously positive . 

his next role , that of a deceased pediatrician in what dreams may come , was unfortunately lackluster . 

and so , after a six-year stint as a comedic actor , the proof on whether or not williams can cut it in the dramatic league has come down to patch adams . 

williams is the title character , hunter "" patch "" adams , sporting scruffy facial hair that falls between the clean-shavenness of dreams and the grotesque hairiness of will hunting . 

we're introduced to patch as he commits himself to a mental institution because of his suicidal tendancies . 

it's at the institution , however , that he discovers a latent talent for relating to people . 

he removes himself from the institution and enrolls at the university of virginia's medical college , where he finds that medical doctrine is a calculating , impersonal trade . 

his attempts to inject humanity into the profession result in several bouts with expulsion , and the movie climaxes with patch's appearance before the state medical board . 

the characters are well-defined in an oscar-worthy sense . 

although the script does not perform well as a narrative -- there's little story to be told outside of patch's skit-length experiences -- the script does go a long way toward building the relationships of characters . 

at medical school , patch meets up with truman schiff ( daniel london ) , an outsider like himself who relishes patch's zest for humanity . 

the two instantly become the best of friends , and it's easy to see why . 

monica potter plays patch's love interest , a young woman who personifies the things that patch hates about medical school . 

for some reason he's attracted to her , and although it never gets said , the audience understands from an intrinsic point of view . 

the script -- based on hunter adams' own story -- works well this way . 

the rest of the cast , bob gunton as the villain professor in particular , is solid . 

director tom shadyac ( liar liar ) leads us in and out of patch's life in a sound , intentional manner ; combined with williams' presence on screen , the movie rarely becomes boring . 

patch adams' lack of purpose is its major shortcoming , and for the first ninety minutes out of two hours , there's little feeling of continuity or the passage of time . 

nevertheless , it's an emotionally moving picture , and patch adams looks to be one of the more memorable of the holiday season . 

it succeeds at everything it tries , and only fails at the stuff it doesn't try in the first place . 

by and large there may be another oscar nomination herein for williams , but more importantly , it's entertainment for the entire family .

"synopsis : blond criminal psychologist sarah chooses to copulate with greasy tony the mysterious puerto rican rather than bearded cliff the wisecracking neighbor upstairs . 

in the meantime , someone sends sarah rotting flowers , puts her name in the newspaper's obituary column , and kills her cat . 

comments : never talk to strangers , a colossal waste of time , moves slower than molasses in winter to arrive at a conclusion which should be obvious to the audience 20 minutes into the film . 

one wouldn't think that two genuine movie stars , antonio banderas ( evita ) and rebecca de mornay ( hand that rocks the cradle ) , and the acerbic comic genius dennis miller ( "" saturday night live "" ) would be involved in such a celluloid backfire as this turkey . 

not only are they in it , however , but de mornay executive produced it . 

what was she thinking ? 

never talk to strangers centers upon sarah , a psychologist examining the ill-tempered max , a murderer soon to stand trial . 

she receives a sudden visit from her father which elicits flashbacks of some tragedy in her early childhood . 

two men woo her ; tony the "" security consultant "" wins her over ( so they have passionate sex replete with cheesy saxophone music ) . 

a lot of psychobabble is thrown around about multiple personality disorder , but the movie asks its audience not to derive the obvious conclusion between mpd and sarah , and instead offers several male characters as red herrings . 

86 minutes , the running time of this cinematic mess , thus , seem like 86 hours . 

a good chunk of never talk to strangers is spent upon sarah and tony . 

why would the career-minded , professional sarah feel attracted to the walking steroid with a black hat called tony ? 

that's one of the film's mysteries which are never answered . 

regardless of motive , de mornay and banderas strip down and have sex several times in what passes for eroticism . 

they also manage to go out before copulating occasionally -- in one of the stupidest scenes of the film , tony takes sarah to a carnival that's * right outside * his dingy apartment ( that way , they can hurry back and have sex quickly ) . 

also , apparently , the weather changes quickly in their locale : they're at this outdoor carnival one day before having sex ; the next day , they're out playing in the snow before having sex . 

the filmmakers attempt to produce a suspenseful plot interspersed with tony and sarah's "" character development . "" 

someone is out to get poor sarah ( though most of the audience should have figured out who before any of this starts ) . 

rotting flowers , a writeup in the obituary , and a beaten neighbor are just a few of the bad things which happen to her . 

suspense cliche number one also occurs : whenever someone is stalked in thrillers , by any means , if the stalked has a pet , that pet will die . 

oftentimes , to even further the cliche , the murdered pet is a cat ( suspense filmmakers , for some reason , just don't like cats ) . 

sarah , in never talk to strangers , receives a package and , lo and behold , discovers her mutilated cat within . 

suspense at its very derivative ! 

as stated before , never talk to strangers is a poor excuse for a film whose sole purpose seems to be exploiting banderas and de mornay's bodies as often as possible . 

comedian dennis miller is completely wasted here ( he's not given lines that are suitable for his persona ) and doesn't even appear all that much . 

maybe , in a way , he's lucky for that . 

early on in the movie , sarah tells tony , after meeting him in a supermarket , that she had been advised to never talk to strangers . 

allow me to advise that you never watch this stinker . 
"
"is jimmy stewart the greatest actor of all-time ? 

it's quite possible . 

his career spanned over 40 years , and he acted in more movies than most actors ever could . 

yet , when he is talked about in the media , he is generally thought of as an actor who played one type of role : the nice guy . 

and that's really a shame . 

 "" the naked spur "" features jimmy stewart in a role completely different than what people would expect from him . 

it's a western , which stewart specialized in around this period , and it casts him as a desperate man out to collect a bounty on a man who used to be his friend . 

before he finds that man , though , he runs into two men who agree to help him , thinking he is a sheriff . 

when the criminal is eventually caught , the two men discover stewart's secret , and decide they want a piece of the action too . 

the rest of the film is a suspenseful journey in which each man suspects the other constantly . 

also featured is the woman travelling with the criminal , well played by janet leigh . 

we're never too sure who's side she's really on until the end . 

leigh is an actress probably best known for her role as the "" shower lady "" from "" psycho "" , and that's unfair . 

she gives a strong performance as a woman who is pulled between these two men . 

stewart gives a performance unlike anything i've ever seen from him . 

he usually keeps cool no matter what occurs , but here , he gets downright hysterical at times . 

i think perhaps he took this role to prove to the public that he was more than just a "" nice guy "" . 

his performance borders on psychotic at times , but i loved watching every second of it . 

it's roles like this one that make me admire him as much as i do . 

he was an actor unafraid to take chances , and even ruin his public image .

"capsule : the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smith's films gets their own movie . 

the gags are sporadically funny . 

it is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and anti-gay jokes . 

the plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team . 

the little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film . 

sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching . 

this feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night . 

 ( and it turns out he had very good reasons . ) 

 , low 0 ( -4 to +4 ) 

a film needs a plot . 

it needs characters for empathy value . 

it needs a story and an emotional center . 

if a film is just a chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are . 

kevin smith has now made two satisfying films , clerks and chasing amy . 

with dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp . 

peter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled . 

but getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smith's fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it . 

his remaining two films , mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience . 

jay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay jokes , penis jokes , flatulence jokes , film pastiches , and in-jokes . 

how funny the jokes are will be a subjective call . 

for me , the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny . 

there was not enough cleverness or variety . 

it is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay . 

penis jokes work only so many times . 

showing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gags . 

they were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford , the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british post-war films including dead of night , the lady vanishes , and passport to pimlico . 

jay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation x stoners . 

as the series wore on they had larger and larger parts . 

in jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads . 

jay and silent bob ( played by jason mewes and kevin smith ) are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks . 

this leaves them at loose ends . 

they are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that a comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into a movie . 

they decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash . 

so it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way . 

the film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood 

the problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny . 

silent bob , being silent , can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his . 

this makes his piece of the comedy even less than a straight man like a dean martin or bud abbott would have . 

jay has to be the comic . 

he could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive . 

the problem is that he is not sufficiently funny . 

he is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair . 

so jay and silent bob are a long way from being a successful comic team . 

their starring roles and the low humor make this a comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen before--sometimes just minutes before . 

like dogma before it , but definitely not like chasing amy , this film feels more like an amateurish skit than a real movie . 

certainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving . 

they are excuses for gags , many of which still fall flat . 

it is dogma without any of the humorous theological content . 

the film does not offer much to an adult audience . 

i rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .

"after the recent animated debacles of , "" a rugrats movie , "" and "" a bug's life , "" i am seriously considering raising my highly negative rating on dreamworks' other insect film from october , "" antz . "" 

i hated that movie , and yet , it is so much better than these latest two excursions . 

 "" a bug's life , "" is the second animated insect film in the last two months , and i hoped for the best , considering it was done in the wonderful style of pixar's last film , 1995's "" toy story , "" but in no way does , "" a bug's life , "" even remotely match up to that . 

flik ( david foley ) , an ant , who along with his many comrades , has the job every year of gathering up the seasonal harvest , only to have to give half of it away to the dominating grasshoppers , led by hopper ( kevin spacey ) . 

flik , however , feels all alone and unwanted in the world , especially after he accidentally loses all of their food , and the ants are threated by hopper to gather up a whole other season's load by the time the last summer leaf falls from the trees . 

banished from ant island , flik leaves the colony in search of some strong reinforcement to help out , but through a misunderstanding , returns with a handful of helpless circus bugs , including a walking stick ( david hyde pierce ) , a dung beetle ( brad garrett ) , a gypsy moth ( madeline kahn ) , a male ladybug ( denis leary ) , and a caterpillar ( joe ranft ) . 

 "" a bug's life , "" has one thing going for it . 

only one thing . 

with its glorious , bright colors , the computer-generated animation is a spectacle to look at . 

the film itself , unfortunately , is a lifeless , unamusing contraption without any of the flair or excitement of , "" toy story . "" 

the characters in , "" a bug's life , "" are an assortment of either unlikable or dull insects without any charm or personality , other than to stand around and recite arbitrary and thoroughly unfunny one-liners . 

the thin story was also stretched out to a nearly unbearable 94 minutes , and it often felt as if they ran out of ideas throughout , and so they made up pointless scenes to pass as time-filler . 

after giving such scathing reviews to the animated films from this year , i was beginning to think that i had simply outgrown them , but then i realized this is just not so . 

i still adore almost all of the older disney films , and many of the newer ones , such as 1989's , "" the little mermaid , "" 1991's , "" beauty and the beast , "" 1993's , "" the nightmare before christmas , "" and yes , 1995's , "" toy story . "" 

maybe this has just been a bad year for children's films , and hopefully , the upcoming , "" the prince of egypt , "" will not be a disappointment . 

as for , "" a bug's life , "" i did not enjoy anything about it . 

not the story , not the characters , and not even the voiceover work , which was far more lively in , "" antz . "" 

 "" a bug's life , "" goes down as yet another failure for disney , and it is a sad state of affairs when their best film in the last two years has been the minor jonathan taylor thomas picture , "" i'll be home for christmas . "" 
"
" "" there's nothing new under the sun "" is a phrase often used when the speaker actually means "" let's find something to copy . "" 

of course there are very few completely original ideas . 

even earth-shattering concepts are built upon the vast body of human experience . 

there is , after all , no need to re-invent the wheel time after time . 

recently it seems that hollywood doesn't feel the need to even re-write the script . 

my understanding of the word "" sequel "" is a continuation of the story . 

the film industry has defined the word to mean reshooting the original with minor changes . 

have an overwhelming desire to see an inferior version of brian depalma's adaptation of the steven king novel ? 

this is your dream come true . 

rachel ( emily bergl ) , a high school outcast , is beginning to notice weird things happening around her . 

doors slam shut by themselves . 

glass globes blow up . 

her mother has severe mental problems and her father is absent . 

a popular boy unexpectedly asks her out . 

the in-crowd conspires to embarrass her at a public event . 

any of this sound familiar ? 

once the audience catches on that this is the same story as "" carrie "" , there's little to do but wait for the inevitable ending . 

the effects are a bit better this time around , but the film doesn't work nearly as well . 

there are a couple of minor plot differences . 

rachel lives with foster parents because her mother is institutionalized . 

the boys at her school are portrayed as even more evil than in the original . 

they keep score of their scoring with points given for each conquest . 

and , uh , there must be other story changes but none stand out . 

one nice touch is the casting of amy irving again as sue snell . 

over 20 years ago she was the one girl who tried to help carrie . 

now a high school counselor , she befriends rachel , but her character's potential is squandered . 

there's too much about sue that doesn't make sense . 

after the slaughter when carrie kills most of her classmates , sue is driven mad and spends time in the institution that rachel's mother is in . 

still living in the same small town , the woman with a well-known history of mental problems is hired as a high school counselor ? 

sue tells rachel that her telekinesis is a genetic disease . 

this may be the one original idea in the film , but the reasoning behind describing psychic powers as a "" disease "" is never explained . 

sue's eventual fate is an admission by director katt shea and writer rafael moreu that they had an interesting character but couldn't figure out what to do with her . 

blink and you'll miss it . 

some of the events are filmed in black and white , but the rationale for this is unknown . 

it doesn't add anything and the choice of scenes appears somewhat random . 

 "" the rage "" retains some of the trappings of "" carrie "" without the meaning . 

in the first film the color red was a motif connected to carrie's onset of powers at the same time she began menstruating . 

here there's an abundance of red , but for no apparent purpose . 

the casting of high school jocks and cheerleaders as villains is beginning to wear thin . 

one might be lead to suspect that most filmmakers were unpopular in school and the history of teenage films is an extended cinematic revenge of the nerds . 

the biggest mistake the film makes is including clips of the original . 

seeing sissy spacek on the screen only points to the quality of that film - and the flaws in this one . 
"
"it used to be that not just anyone could become a vampire . 

usually , you had to be an aristocrat - a count such as dracula or karnstein . 

to qualify , you'd have to have a modicum of sophistication , so you'd at least look cool - or suave - when biting into some young damsel's throat . 

but today , in our overly politically correct world , any scuzzy-looking , long-haired , unshaven lout or any spiked-haired harridans can put the bite on you . 

by the same token , to be a vampire hunter , one had to have some sort of medical training and knowledge of the occult or maybe perhaps be some sort of professional soldier , or at least one who retired with honors . 

not in these times . 

all you need are some sharp weapons , some bullets forged from silver and any yahoo can be a buffy - or a blade . 

without sounding elitist , the fear of vampires has greatly diminished because of this lack of exclusivity . 

which brings us to blade , the latest in a long line of vampire movies in which , it seems , half the population is putting the bite on the other half . 

not only are there thousands of vampires , but they seem to move from city to city , pay off police departments and , most importantly , establish their own exclusive after-hours raves in which the highlight is the sprinkler system going off and dousing all the occupants in a blood shower . 

with all that blood , you wonder why they have to hunt for victims . 

you also wonder when they get the time to get their clothes dry-cleaned and why no cleaner ever complains about all the bloodstains . 

blade , which is based on a marvel comic book character , is , like a comic book , all visual . 

the plot is basically blade repetitiously slashing his way through the vampire army seeking their leader , deacon frost . 

it's all hokum and nonsense , of course . 

but the filmmakers play it straight . 

unfortunately , at least at the advance screening i attended , the audience didn't see it that way and laughed through much of the proceedings . 

you know a movie is in trouble when the scenes of blood and gore that should elicit screams of fright instead evoke peels of laughter . 

another tell-tale sign is when the audience seems to be admiring the hero's costume more than the hero . 

also it seems it's not enough for today's vampire merely to have fangs . 

he must also be proficient in the martial arts . 

why a supernatural being , one of the undead , needs such skills is beyond me . 

 ( of course , this concept dates to the 1974 hammer films-run run shaw production of legend of the seven golden vampires , in which dracula is defeated by seven karate-chopping siblings . ) 

wesley snipes is buff as blade . 

he growls his lines -the few he has - and spends most of the time glowering - as if he was suffering from indigestion or having second thoughts about starring in and co-producing this turkey . 

blade is just another example of how the vampire film , a once honorable member of the horror family , has gone downhill . 

this dud mostly makes you yearn for those quaint old days when christopher lee could be stopped just by dangling a crucifix in his face . 

today's vampires lack the panache , the style of a bela lugosi or a christopher lee . 

they are not even worthy enough to carry those great bloodsuckers' capes . 

they are more farcical than frightful . 

this whole enterprise is one dull blade that could have used lots of sharpening . 
"
"while i am not fond of any writer's use of cheap , easy puns , i am not completely above using them myself when the situation merits it ( witness my review of _pecker_ from a couple of issues ago ) . 

so here goes : the juvenile , college-set black comedy _dead_man_on_campus_ is dead on arrival . 

strait-laced med student josh ( tom everett scott , who manages to remain somewhat likable throughout ) 's blemish-free academic record breaks out into fs , thanks to the influence of his ever-partying roommate , cooper ( mark-paul gosselaar ) , who introduces josh to the sex- and booze-filled nights that come with university life . 

with the threat of losing an academic scholarship ( josh ) and a life cleaning toilets for his dad looming ( cooper ) , what are two good-hearted slackers to do ? 

easy--look for a loophole , which they find in the form of an unbelievable rule in the school charter that states that if a student's ( or students' ) roommate commits suicide , the surviving student ( s ) shall receive straight as . 

so instead of studying , josh and cooper attempt to seek out the most depressed student out there , move him into their dorm room , and drive him to suicide before the semester ends . 

director alan cohn and screenwriters michael traeger and mike white ( working from a story by anthony abrams and adam larson broder ) take their sweet time to build the head of steam that comes with josh and cooper's diabolical plot . 

until then , the usual boring cliches of college life ( booze , sex , more booze ) fill the time , which is made to feel longer by _saved_by_the_bell_ alumnus gosselaar's sitcom-bred mugging . 

that said , once cohn and company do build some comic momentum , they mishandle it . 

the introduction of the manic , psychotic cliff ( lochlyn munro ) , a potential roommate for josh and cooper , brings some demented life to the uninspired proceedings before being hastily written out in favor of two less interesting candidates : paranoid nerd buckley ( randy pearlstein ) and british death rocker matt ( corey page ) . 

one wishes that cliff would reappear , but , as they say , be careful what you wish for . 

not surprisingly , he does resurface , and it then becomes clear that this is a character that is best taken in a small dose ; almost immediately , his extended boorish and sociopathic antics loses its novelty . 

the same can be said about all of _dead_man_on_campus_ . 

whatever morbid appeal the far-fetched premise has quickly evaporates , and the self-absorbed characters , especially cooper , pretty much grate from the get-go . 

_dead_man_ doesn't grow tiresome ; it already _is_ once the clever opening titles are through . 

as it slogs along to a cheesy , happy-for-all-parties conclusion , _dead_man_ lives up to its title and then some--not only does the movie grow even more tired and die , it still insists on going on . . . 

like a zombie .

"i can imagine how good krippendorf's tribe must have looked on paper . 

it does not surprise me in the least that a group of extremely talented actors , led by the great richard dreyfuss and a good director ( todd holland ) , all wanted to make this film . 

in fact , it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorf's tribe as possible . 

in retrospect , i can imagine how bad this film could have been . 

i shudder at the possibilities of awfulness had it starred an actor less able than dreyfuss . 

dreyfuss plays james krippendorf , an anthropologist who is granted $100 , 000 by his university to find an undiscovered tribe in new guinea . 

halfway into his two-year expedition , his wife ( apparently ) dies . 

i say apparently because when or how she dies is never truly established . 

later , we find out that much of the grant money was spent on big-screen tvs and other such pleasures . 

so , when krippendorf finds out what happens to professors who do not use their grant money wisely , he decides to construct an elaborate lie . 

he makes his own tribe , using his three children as actors in a video . 

he simply makes up certain incredible facts about this tribe ( which he calls the shelmickedmu ) . 

audiences at krippendorf's lectures are amazed by his findings that the shelmickedmu practice circumcision . 

and proof that the typical family unit is led by a single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community . 

like all films like this , the lie becomes more and more complex , and the suspense is generated with us wondering at what point it is all going to fall out from under our hero . 

dreyfuss is a funny , talented man , and he is funny in this film . 

he has lots of positive energy and , unlike most comical actors , really manages to play people like this realistically . 

this film also requires a lot of physical humor that i've never seen dreyfuss perform , and he does a great job . 

jenna elfman , who plays veronica mecilli , a scientist who wants in on krippendorf's work , is also very funny and appealing here . 

and the kid actors are great , as well . 

but we're talking about the script from hell . 

this is one of those stories that requires such extreme suspension of disbelief that they might as well have established that the story just takes place in an alternate universe where things like this can happen . 

but the ridiculousness of the story is not really what is so bad about it . 

all the cliches and the irritating plot devices could have easily been overcome by dreyfuss and crew . 

no , the script is plagued with so many clueless stereotypes and mean-spirited characters that i was in disbelief as i watched . 

furthermore , the manor in which all of this material is covered up is truly shameless . 

take , for instance , the scene in which krippendorf gets veronica drunk so he can tape them having sex . 

they get all decked out in the tribe getup , complete with paint to darken their skin . 

krippendorf does this because he needs footage of the mating rituals of his tribe . 

now , i saw this scene coming from a mile away , but i said to myself , "" no , that would be far too tasteless . 

there's no way they'll do that . . . oh 

god ! "" 

they did do it . 

it's there . 

i was almost more appalled by the fact that this didn't bother the other audience members with whom i saw this film . 

i found it deplorable . 

and when krippendorf is forced to admit that he did it , he simply apologizes without the slightest hint of conviction in his voice . 

the film is filled with scenes like these . 

they not only insult the audience , but they insult the types of people that the film portrays . 

it would take some truly professional work to create videos convincing enough to fool an entire community of scientists , yet krippendorf does it easily in an afternoon . 

and watching dreyfuss stumble over a completely unprepared speech is funny and entertaining , but i think that most members of the on-screen audience would be able to see that he is making everything up as he goes . 

if i were an anthropologist , this film would insult me immensely . 

moving right along , the film plays off every stereotype our culture has ever learned regarding african tribes . 

sure , dreyfuss dressing up like a chief is really funny , and it allows for some entertaining scenes , but the heart of this material is deeply clueless as to the themes and thoughts that it provokes . 

it is because of dreyfuss as an actor that i was able to watch this film . 

his character here is not a good subject for a film because he is a shameless liar , and never once does he show any kind of penance for what he does . 

i suppose it was interesting to see the formula defied in this case , but for the purposes of good taste , i would have expected something . 

no , this man sets a terrible example for his kids and colleagues , and the writer of the film ( charlie peters ) didn't include a single scene in which krippendorf takes his kids aside and tells them that what he is doing is very bad . 

in fact , it's his eldest daughter that frequently tells him that he is doing the wrong thing , and he continually shrugs off her warnings . 

i suppose it's important to admit that this is a funny film . 

dreyfuss and elfman , and many of the contrived and insulting scenes , add up to a picture that is anything but boring . 

and if you're less serious than i , you probably will enjoy it . 

i , however , can't get past these elements . 

krippendorf's tribe is being marketed as a family comedy , but this is the kind of film that teaches the kids of our society faulty lessons that they shouldn't be learning . 

with a little more insight into its story and themes , this could have been a good movie .

"i'll bet right now you're just lounging by the pool , humming "" i will always love you "" and wistfully recalling your candlelight dinners with success . 

it isn't necessarily over for you : i say you still have enough charm that you could avoid starring in "" kevin ! "" 

for at least a few more years . 

begin by scribbling "" the star that burns twice as bright burns half as long "" somewhere you'll always see it , perhaps on the fridge door , or on a bedroom mirror with lipstick . 

you had a heck of a thing going there until you agreed to star in robin hood : prince of thieves , where you were not only upstaged by powerhouses morgan freeman and alan rickman , but christian slater ( ! ) , several dozen tall trees , bows , arrows , and a canoe , too . 

after dances with wolves and jfk , you decided the world needed more three hour movies , expensive three hour movies , so you starred in and produced wyatt earp ; wyatt earp the man was a boring idiot who made the history books solely due to a general lack of famous wyatts . 

wyatt earp was so dull a cowboy that he died of natural causes . 

tombstone was a vastly superior movie based on the same legend , and that featured kurt russell as earp and dana delaney as his girlfriend !

what were you and lawrence kasdan thinking ? ) 

now , you're suffering the demise of yet another of your epics , the postman , a film so financially disastrous that it all but eradicated the memory waterworld's and tin cup's mildly lucrative box office takes .

dances with wolves was golden and brown-it looked like an eggo commercial . 

the postman had me running for a glass of water every two minutes ; would the post-apocalyptic world look this maddeningly bland and dry ? 

what exactly happened to this desert world , anyway ? 

did we all become so stupid that we didn't immediately begin rebuilding homes , restaurants , and most importantly , shopping malls , after "" the war "" ? 

why did you choose to drive the movie's plot with a dumb group of terrorists who , well , terrorize townfolk across america ? 

why is it only * they * have ammunition , anyway ? 

was it really appropriate to cast your daughter as a girl who has a sweet crush on you , the drifter-cum-postman ? 

why cast english actress olivia williams as an american ? 

don't you realize that european women can only deliver their big emotional scenes in their native accent ? 

 ( take a look at the less-than-stellar performances of an american-ized nicole kidman or an american-ized minnie driver . ) 

who could give a damn whether you lived or died at the end of this movie ? 

if it came down to a fight for leadership between you and the leader of the terrorists , why didn't you do that halfway through the film and save us all a lot of headaches ? 

why cast will patton as the bad guy ? 

because you worked with him in no way out ? 

sure , he's a suitably creepy villain ; know why ? 

because he's creepy in everything , including armageddon , in which he plays a heroic astronaut who practically slithers into his space suit ! 

why heroize the most demonic institution in america , the u . s . postal system ? 

was tom petty supposed to be playing tom petty ? 

if so , why didn't he look more skeletal ? 

 ( he should have been around 70 years old . ) 

why , oh why , do i have so many questions ? 

 ( i could ask plenty more . ) 

shouldn't a three hour running time have provided you enough space to answer everything ? 

you have one great line in this film , and you deliver it to a mule ! : 

 "" the things i like about my ass . . . "" 

i had to wonder . 

actually , i enjoyed the tone of the opening scenes , a relaxed cynicism , if you'll accept such clunky phrasing-too bad you couldn't resist the temptation to film yet another love letter to your country . 

ultimately , i'm saying relax . 

there is no quota , no need for you to make a picture a year . 

settle down . 

really question future screenplays before you commit to them . 

feel free to write back . 

i know how much you like letters .

"john sayles' "" men with guns "" is about what happens to a society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power . 

the film takes place in an unnamed central american country , where the men with guns are the rulers . 

most of the country is divided into tiny segments - some are controlled by guerrillas with guns , some are controlled by army soldiers with guns , and all the spaces in-between are controlled by thieves , bandits , and terrorists . 

all people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness . 

however , like so many central american countries , this one also features modernity . 

there is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization : skyscrapers , hospitals , televisions , highways , etc . but , it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land , or else they are simply ignorant of it . 

the film's main character , dr . fuentes ( federico luppi ) falls into the latter category . 

one of his patients , an army general , describes him as the most educated man he has ever met , and also the most naive . 

fuentes is a true liberal , a caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country by fighting bacteria and ignorance among the indigenous indians . 

with government assistance , he has trained a large group of eager young medical students and sent them into the rainforest to cure and educate . 

this program was to be his legacy , and he repeats over and over that it was a good idea . 

however , when he ventures into that same rainforest to visit his prot ? g ? s , he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned . 

as he travels deeper into the forest , going from village to village , the story is always the same : the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers , usually for helping the other . 

when dr . fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors , she replies simply , "" because they had guns , and we didn't . "" 

rational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns , because others' sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power . 

dr . fuentes picks up several companions during his journey , all of whom are characterized by their loss . 

first , there is a young boy named conejo ( dan rivera gonz ? lez ) , who has neither a mother nor a father . 

next , fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo ( dami ? n delgado ) , who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities . 

through his ordeal in the army , domingo has lost most of his self-respect , and defines himself only by his pistol . 

along the way , the group also picks up padre portillo ( dami ? n alc ? zar ) , a priest who has lost his faith . 

as domingo is running from the army , so is portillo - he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer , and ran away from the village in which he was preaching . 

last , the group takes on a mute girl named graciela ( tania cruz ) , who hasn't spoken since she was raped two years earlier , her innocence and even her will to live forcefully taken from her . 

sayles two major strengths as a director - characters and setting - are abundantly evident in "" men with guns . "" 

 ( like many of his films , sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room , but a longer-than-necessary running time is a sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor . ) 

he creates fascinating , complex characters , especially dr . fuentes and domingo . 

their uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the film's overarching theme of violence as power - domingo's attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes' belief that the revolver is unloaded ( at first it is , but later is isn't ) . 

the setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself . 

sayles knows how to bring a location to life , whether it be an early twentieth-century coal mining town in "" matewan "" ( 1987 ) or a contemporary texas/mexico bordertown in "" lone star "" ( 1996 ) . 

sayles is not a particularly inventive director - he likes to let his actors do most of the work - but he and cinematographer slavomir idziak ( "" gattaca "" ) successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the central american terrain . 

sayles also maintains a strong sense of authenticity by filming everything on location in mexico , using all latin american actors , and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects . 

the one exception is a couple of bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief , but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on a few hundred miles south of the texas border . 

it would not be a stretch to say that "" men with guns "" is a depressing film . 

in fact , the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure . 

in addition to loss , the main characters are also failures at something , whether that be dr . fuentes failure to change anything through medicine , or padre portillo's inability to stand up and be the martyr he always dreamed of being . 

nevertheless , it is bleak material sayles has chosen , and he deals with it accordingly . 

the last shot of the film does offer a hint of hope , even in a world where , as one character puts it , "" nobody refuses the men with guns . ""

"warning ! : may contain some mild spoilers and offensive material . 

rated : r ( ! ) for sexual content , crude and sexual humor , and some nudity . . 

 ( a mild r rating ) 

starring : rob schneider , oded fehr , eddie griffin , arija bareikis , amy poehler , norm mcdonald . 

running time : 88 minutes 

 "" deuce bigalow : male gigolo "" is simply a hilarious good-natured comedy that may offend some , but underneath all it's crude humor and sexual content is a sweet little love story that is surprisingly involving . 

it isn't any kind of cinematic classic , but it's a very very funny comedy that keeps us entertained until the end credits which themselves are funny too . 

it has all it needs to be a breezy entertaining comedy : the acting is up to pace and some of the performances quite funny , the screenplay is witty and smart , and the whole story is sweet and cute . 

deuce bigalow ( rob schneider ) is your typically average guy : he cleans fish tanks for a living and gets an average of 10 bucks for it . 

though one might call him a loser , deuce gets a job he would never thought he would get . 

he gets to clean the tank for a male gigolo ( oded fehr ) and gets offered to watch over his place while he goes on a trip . 

trying to be like him he hangs upside down from a pole and accidentally pushes off the fishtank and burns his cabinets . 

the thing is now he has to try and find $6 , 000 dollars in three weeks to make sure everything looks right again . 

so he decides to go "" man-whoring "" and to his luck gets the oddest people on earth : an over-weight woman who decidedly wants to eat everything in site , a woman with narcolepsy who sleeps all the time , a woman who has sudden screaming outbursts , and a woman he can't stop thinking about . 

he charges $10 but he is willing to negotiate . 

from now on he is considered deuce bigalow : male gigolo . 

with non-stop laughs an a abundence of crude humor "" deuce bigalow : male gigolo "" is sometimes like last years hit "" there's something about mary "" that is offensive but very funny . 

the screenplay by harris goldberg and rob schneider himself is a smart , clever and witty screenplay that seems to have been written with care to make is so hilariously funny . 

the characters in the film are all actually likable especially "" jabba lady "" with her big body but soft heart . 

there are actually times in the movie where i fell out of my chair laughing so hard that my stomach was killing me . 

even though i thought "" toy story 2 "" and "" being john malkovich "" were the funniest of the year "" deuce bigalow "" follows right behind them . 

the directing by mike mitchell is fantastic and shows he took time on the film . 

rob schneider gives a surprisingly endearing performance and when his romance develops with one of his customers kate ( arija bareikis ) it is a sweet romance that we get involved in and actually like being involved in it . 

 "" deuce bigalow "" is a good-natured film worth all the merit it can get . 

its not a classic or a masterpiece , it's just a comedy that we don't feel bad about watching . 

sure it may come off as offensive and may come off as dumb sometimes , but you cannot deny that it isn't funny . 

 "" deuce bigalow : male gigolo "" is no disappointment . 

its a fast paced , entertaining sweet and hilarious comedy that may be destined to become a cult classic . 

fans of schneider will not be disappointed and fans of crude but nice comedies will not either . 

for some reason the film garnered an r rating but with no "" f words "" or extensive use of sexual content or explicit nudity i was really wondering why the film was r . a mild r to put it to the least , but even if your under 17 or above at least 13 this film is good enough for you to see . 

don't try to be one of those people who make so much of a film that they do not like it , just sit back , laugh and enjoy the movie .

"part buddy comedy , part fish-out-of-water story , part nature tale , meet the deedles is not nearly as interesting as any of those archetypes . 

in fact , it is an invitation you ought to disregard . 

phil and stew deedle ( paul walker and steve van wormer ) are the twin sons of the famous millionaire , elton deedle ( eric braeden ) , founder of deedle enterprises . 

elton wants his sons to be the perfect heirs to his fortune . . . instead 

the two are careless hawaiian surf bums . 

to set them straight , he enrolls them into a strict wyoming boot camp , to which the pair inevitably go . 

after several misadventures in wyoming , where the duo is stunned to discover there's no surf , the brothers deedle stumble upon a routine mistaken identity plot . 

they arrive at yellowstone national park , where they are believed to be two new park ranger recruits . 

rather than slinking back home and disappointing their dad , the deedles play along . 

phil , actually , has other motives : the beautiful park ranger jesse ( a . 

j . langer ) , who unfortunately happens to be the beloved stepdaughter of the overprotective park ranger captain douglas pine ( john ashton ) . 

yellowstone has a problem . 

it's only a week before the famous geyser old faithful celebrates its one billionth birthday , and the park is being overrun with prairie dogs . 

not just one or two . . . thousands of them . 

the deedles are assigned to eliminate the p . dog menace , not knowing that it all is part of a fiendish plan by disgraced former head ranger frank slater ( dennis hopper ) . 

the brothers deedle aren't supposed to be out-and-out stupid , like the team from dumb and dumber , or bill and ted . 

instead , their brains just operate in a different , simpler , realm . 

a more accurate comparison would be with carrot top in chairman of the board , a film which , unfortunately , this one resembles in several hideous ways . 

the central problem with meet the deedles is that it simply just isn't funny . 

there's a moment when phil utters the line , "" insert laugh here "" , which nearly sums up the entire meet the deedles experience . 

the result isn't bad in a run-shrieking-from-the-theater type of way . 

instead , it's merely bad in an excruciatingly boring sort of way . 

the cast seems decent , but they're never asked to do anything remotely interesting . 

instead , the film inundates the audience with countless shots of people and/or cars rolling downhill in the forest , and with constant annoying references to other disney films . 

you'll have much better luck finding a good spot to surf in wyoming than finding entertainment in meet the deedles .

"i was anxious to see this for a long time . 

a friend of mine recommended this to me because he has a crush on neve campbell , and he wanted to prove that she's as hot as he thinks he is . 

he proved it for me all right , but the reasons i enjoy this film go way beyond that . 

scream treads on familar ground , horror movie with , as star neve campbell puts it , "" some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl who can't act who's always running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door . "" 

it's very familar , your typical horror film . 

so why , you may ask after watching it , does it seem so new and original ? 

because it treats itself as if it hasn't been done before , and thus the viewer is disilusioned into believing that it is not old , familar tired stuff . 

this raises another question : how does it do this ? 

simple : the characters . 

they're not your typical stupid horror film victims who don't know what the hell to do when being chased by a guy in a ski mask and a machette . 

they are horror fans , they know how stuff happens in a horror movie , they know what to do and what not to do , and that makes it scary , and even funny at certain times . 

you can tell this just by watching the opening scene where casey becker ( drew barrymore ) is making popcorn , getting ready to watch a video , and some guy who sounds like a killer calls her up to play a game with her that involves horror movie triva that , if she gets it wrong , will get her and her boyfriend killed . 

she knows what to answer when he asks her horror film questions , she just can't answer his final question , "" what door am i at ? "" 

and that gets her killed . 

that scene works because in a normal horror film , half the things that happen in that scene would never happen . 

the plot is typical horror stuff : sidney prescott ( an impressive neve campbell ) , an attractive young high school student who's mother was killed a year ago tommorrow , is being stalked by a killer who's previously murdered one of her classmates ( casey , naturally ) , and everybody in this small , california town is a suspect , including sidney's boyfriend , billy loomis . 

but as i said before , these people know how horror movies work , and that's what makes it so appealing . 

that and the references to horror movies , like when casey says , "" the first ( nightmare on elm street ) was scary , but the rest sucked . "" 

which is obviously director wes craven ( who does a good job of poking fun of the genre that made him a legend ) patting himself on the back as he directed the first nightmare movie and none of the others , and when tatum , sidney's friend , mentions the director , wes carpenter , which is obviously an homage by writer kevin williamson to not only craven , but also director john carpenter . 

the cast is well chosen , neve campbell pulls off a good heroine ( and unlike most horror film heroines , she * can * act ) , drew barrymore does a good janet leigh impression for what little time she has in the film , and david arquette is impressive . 

also good ( and funny ) in his role is henry winkler ( "" the fonz "" ) as the school principal . 

i took half a point off for the unnecessary ( albeit limited ) appearance by friends' courteney cox as reporter , gail edwards , sidney's rival because she covered her mother's disappearance . 

i hate that show , i hate those actors . 

they're untalented , overexposed , and overpaid , imho , and i would think wes craven is smart enough to know those actors are overexposed enough , but i suppose he isn't .

"in recent years , harrison ford has been such a grave screen presence , scowling through the likes of tom clancy's jack ryan series , _the_fugitive_ , and last year's smash _air_force_one_ , that one wonders if the rogue charm that made him such a superstar had been completely drained from his system . 

apparently , it was just lying dormant . 

with ivan reitman's enjoyable romantic comedy/adventure _six_days , _seven_nights_ , the lovable scoundrel is back , giving audiences a fresh reminder of why ford is one of the most enduring and popular modern screen icons . 

ford plays quinn harris , a carefree and slightly slobby ( endearingly so ) pilot in the tropics whose broken-down plane crashes in a storm , stranding him and his charter , new york magazine editor robin monroe ( anne heche ) , on a deserted island . 

of course , the sophisticated robin and the salt-of-the-earth quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down , and all manner of hostile repartee is exchanged between the two from their first meeting . 

while some of the lines fall flat , the formulaic motions work because of the unexpectedly electric chemistry between ford and heche . 

both actors , who have largely done serious works as of late , seem liberated by the lack of dramatic weight on their shoulders , and they deliver their zingers , as weak as they sometimes are , with beguiling abandon . 

naturally , there's nothing like a life-threatening crisis to bring two people together , and quinn and robin's warmup to each other is sped up even further by the arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates . 

granted , some conflict needed to be introduced on the island , but this tacked-on development from writer michael browning is a bit too obviously thrown in for the purpose of adding gratuitous action scenes . 

but the point is to get the two together , and their newfound affection causes complications for both , but mostly robin , who came to the islands on a vacation with her fiance frank ( david schwimmer ) , who frantically awaits her return on the home island . 

reitman , and old , reliable hand at breezy comedies , keeps the pace brisk and capably handles the more action-oriented sequences . 

his big accomplishment , however , is bringing the old , smiling ford back . 

as appealing and charismatic as he always is , ford hasn't been quite this charming and affable in years ; he's obviously having a blast , and the audience cannot help but have one along with him . 

holding her own is heche , whose scrappy character never becomes the screaming ninny she initially promises to be ( as the plane goes down , she frantically pops stress pills ) . 

she can take her lumps , physical and otherwise , just as well as quinn , making her a formidable foil and ideal match . 

formulaic and light as a feather , _six_days , _seven_nights_ could be cited as a classic example of the summer "" popcorn "" movie season's lack of substance . 

it's certainly fluff , but it's unpretentious , undemanding , and--most importantly--fun fluff that goes down as easily as a frothy pina colada on a balmy tropical beach . 

pass the popcorn .

"ingredients : little orphan boy , rural grandparents , mountains , native american lore 

synopsis : in this loving film portrayal of an idyllic and pivotal time that a young boy spends with grandpa and grandma , the self recollections of an unseen narrator focus on his world view as a tennessee orphan boy learning of his heritage through his grandparents . 

the setting is after the first world war , during the great depression years . 

a nine-year-old orphan named little tree ( joseph ashton ) is taken in and taught the wondrous ways of the woods by his caucasian moonshiner grandpa ( james cromwell ) and his native american grandma ( tantoo cardinal ) in the wilderness of the mountains of tennessee . 

here little tree learns an almost magical appreciation for nature and farm life - - and experiences beautiful and wondrous things such as the sunrise . 

everything is miraculous to a child . 

but it all comes crashing down for the boy when the u . s . government forcibly takes custody away from grandpa and grandma , and forces little tree to attend the notched gap boarding school , a kind of internment camp where multiracial cherokee kids are indoctrinated to dress , pray , speak , and think like white people or face solitary confinement and corporeal punishment . 

through his childhood experiences , little tree learns lessons about love , race , life , death , people , nature , and folk wisdom . 

opinion : this excellent , excellent family movie . 

it is one of those priceless screen gems that nobody knows about because it's not highly advertised . 

you won't find any formula schlock , cutesy characters , canned spirituality , sequel teasers or commercial tie ins , but you will find the education of little tree to be a refreshing , impeccably acted , original , wonderful , and touching film . 

take the whole family and bring a box of tissues for the tearjerkers . 

this one's as good as old yeller .

"few films in 1999 have divided the critical consensus as sharply as alan parker's adaptation of frank mccourt's memoir angela's ashes . 

many dismissed it as an humorless , sentimentalized , uninteresting version of the hugely popular novel ; others hailed it as a heartfelt , sincere portrait of the human spirit . 

i'm somewhere in between , leaning strongly towards the latter . 

it's certainly well-made and it never becomes tedious like some literary adaptations have a tendency to be . 

but i have a feeling that parker filled the movie with pseudo-lyrical shots of rain falling on the homely streets of ireland just so it can have the two-and-a-half hour running time that screams "" i'm important ! "" 

mccourt's book of the same name was about him and his family moving from the us to ireland in the early 1900's , a time when most people were desperately trying to get into the us . 

as he comments , "" we were the only irishfolk to say goodbye to the statue of liberty . "" 

in ireland , frank ( played by joe breen as a small child ) , his 3 brothers , his mother angela ( emily watson ) and his father malachy ( robert carlyle ) get financial help from angela's mother , a stereotypically strict catholic who chides her daughter for marrying a northern irishman . 

she helps them get a rat-infested apartment and malachy goes looking for a job . 

positions are scarce and when he does finally find one , he is unable to hold on to it because of his fondness for drinking . 

meanwhile , frank goes to an uptight catholic school , where the instructors beat students with blunt wooden objects as often as their heart desires . 

two of frank's brothers soon die , crippled by the dreadful living conditions and malnutrition . 

as if the poverty and the suffering weren't intense enough as it stood , malachy and angela have another baby , worsening the situation further . 

i imagine this doesn't sound like much of a plot . 

that's probably because it isn't one . 

these are people . 

this is their story . 

director alan parker ( the commitments ) knows how to tell a good story and angela's ashes , despite its relentlessly literary tone remains interesting . 

though the film occasionally indulges too much in its gloomily picturesque irish setting , it avoids looking like a glorified travelogue . 

supplementing parker's able direction are the engaging , often poignant performances of the leads , some of them seasoned thespians , others relative beginners . 

carlyle , the charismatic british actor who has shown astonishing range by hopping from the lead in a rowdy slapstick comedy to the villain in a james bond movie and now to sentimental melodrama , perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character . 

we empathize with the guy , but we don't like or admire him . 

emily watson turns in a heartfelt , sincere supporting performance . 

it is mostly she who implants that lump in our throats . 

also worthy of mention is little joe breen , whose face graces the film's superb poster . 

it is breen's first feature film and he's extraordinary as young frank . 

not unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment of the sixth sense , you can peer into the character's soul through breen's sad eyes . 

on the flip side , one thing that could have vastly improved angela's ashes is a more decisive editor . 

while gerry hambling sure makes the most of the scenery , he and parker also leave in at least a half an hour of unnecessary footage . 

the first half , especially , could have been trimmed down , bringing the film to a more reasonable running time and doing our bladders a favor in the process . 

things pick up at about the halfway point , sort of dismissing a lot of the criticisms i accumulated during the opening hour , but i maintain that the aggressively deliberate pace parker and co . set in the first half was ludicrously unnecessary . 

 * spoiler warning ! 

skip next paragraph if in suspense ! * 

the film's final message is somewhat conflicted , as frankie , in effect , leaves his family famished in ireland while he himself goes back to america . 

what , exactly , are we supposed to make of that ? 

his mother doesn't seem to mind because she wants the best possible future for her son , as any mother would , but it still seems inconsiderate of him . 

i haven't read the book , but i'm sure that mccourt justifies his actions therein ; therefore , i'm suspicious . 

another thing that's never made clear in the movie is the meaning of the title , which , i'm sure , is also explained in the memoir . 

if seen as a film onto itself , rather than an adaptation , angela's ashes stands tall . 

despite a few minor setbacks , it is a captivating story of people forced to live in the trenches by an merciless society where those of weaker character are shoved to the bottom of the financial ladder .

"tomb raider . 

fun ? 

exciting ? 

challenging ? 

given the unprecedented popularity ( especially among teenage boys ) of the video game that sports an uber-buff , pistol packin' babe who raids , well . . . 

tombs , you have to believe it's these three things and more ! 

 "" lara croft : tomb raider , "" the big screen variant of said video game , which features a pumped-up angelina jolie ( the oscar ? winner for "" girl , interrupted "" no less ) in the title role is , however , none of these things . 

it isn't fun , it isn't exciting , and the only challenge is seeing how long you can stay in your seat ( i suffered through to the bitter , bitter end ; the wife opted for barnes & noble at the 45-minute mark ) . 

directed by simon west with the same subtlety he brought to "" con air , "" "" tomb raider "" is an empty-headed , big budget bore . 

the story borrows unintelligently from that mother of all turkeys "" hudson hawk "" ( the same hokum about planetary alignments and sacred stones that , when brought together , well . . . 

who the heck cares ? ) and it makes "" super mario bros . "" ( bob hoskins' ill-advised career move ) look like "" rocco and his brothers "" ( that classic of italian neo-realism ) . 

i'll go out on a limb here and say i suspect there's actually more character development in the video game than the movie proper . 

this is where the jolie defenders/video game nuts jump in and say this movie isn't about character development it's about kicking serious butt ( or bum , since ms . croft hails from england's green and pleasant ) . 

with lips , breasts , and biceps all inflated to the max , lara croft is all about posturing , and jolie has a hard time simply standing still without trying to look tough . 

ok , let's forget challenging . 

shouldn't "" tomb raider "" be , at the very least , fun and exciting ? 

shouldn't our butt-kicking heroine also encompass the sophistication of , say , james bond with the wit of indiana jones ? 

there's no humor to be found anywhere in "" tomb raider , "" even though it tries hard from time to time . 

even "" the mummy returns "" didn't take itself too seriously . 

the villain here is noticeably lacking , the special effects are ridiculously overblown and unnecessarily complicated , and the script is non-existent . 

to liven things up ( perhaps ) , jolie's live father jon voight puts in a few minutes as lara's dead father lord croft ; talk about a stretch . 

one thing i hadn't expected from the film is that jolie affects a slightly better english accent than her pa ( although i suspect that thin-looking moustache he's forced to wear gets in the way some ) . 

unsuccessful ? not entirely . 

if anything , "" lara croft : tomb raider "" makes you want to check out the video game itself to figure out exactly what all the fuss was about .

"susan granger's review of "" the musketeer "" ( universal pictures ) 

hollywood launches another assault on classic literature with this $50 million adaptation of alexandre dumas's novel that's strong on action but weak on drama , fusing hong kong martial arts with 17th century swordplay . 

the story chronicles the adventures of the dashing d'artagnan ( justin chambers ) as he leaves his village of gascogne , headed for paris , to join king louis xiii's elite guard , the royal musketeers , and to search for the man who killed his parents 14 years earlier . 

this puts him in conflict with the formidable febre ( tim roth ) , vicious henchman for conniving cardinal richelieu ( stephen rea ) . 

the traditional musketeer trio - aramis ( nick moran ) , athos ( jan gregor kremp ) and porthos ( steve speirs ) - don't offer much help so he turns to the feisty francesca ( mena suvari ) , chambermaid to the queen of france ( catherine deneuve ) . 

scripter gene quintano and director-cinematographer peter hyams are primarily interested in the derring-do , as evidenced by choreographer xin-xin xiong's elaborate - but not original - stunts , including a fast-paced stagecoach chase , a tavern brawl on rolling barrels , high-wire acrobatics with the combatants dangling from ropes , and a ladder-fight sequence . 

filmed in southern france , the scenery , sets and costumes are spectacular , but the lighting is too dark and editing is filled with choppy , restless mtv'ish cuts . 

as the swashbuckling d'artagnan , bland calvin klein model justin chambers buckles where he should be swashing , totally lacking on-screen charisma , not to mention acting skill . 

mena suvari , so impressive in "" american beauty , "" seems like a contemporary interloper in the royal court . 

on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" the musketeer "" is a cinematic but shallow 3 . 

 "" all for one and one for all "" ? 

not this time 'round . 
"
" "" dangerous beauty "" is a really nothing more than a grandiose soap opera set in venice circa 1583 . 

it is beautifully filmed , wonderfully acted , and certainly nothing short of entertaining , but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness . 

dealing with themes of forbidden love , religious intolerance , subordination of women , sexual freedom , and the roles of pleasure and sin in a high-cultured society , it still feels like brightly lit fluff . 

the director , marshall herskovitz , doesn't want to follow the dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down , so he opts for a more genial , livelier , and relatively shallow interpretation . 

the film takes place during the renaissance , a time when venice was the pleasure capital of europe . 

at this time , venice was its own republic , and it thrived on being the central juncture of east-west commerce . 

the film is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of venice , so we rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived . 

however , there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and livelihoods of the upper classes , their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment . 

the story centers on veronica franco ( catherine mccormack ) , a lower class woman who falls in love with marco venier ( rufus sewell ) , the son of wealthy aristocratic parents ( jeroen krabb ? and joanna cassidy ) . 

unfortunately , the culture of that time period did not view marriage as an act of love -- rather , it was more like a business transaction , where rich families married their sons and daughters to each other in order to secure power , wealth , and ensure that outsiders couldn't get in . 

veronica , despite her charm and good looks , is certainly an outsider . 

after a short love affair , marco breaks her heart with the news that he cannot marry her . 

however , because she is beautiful and intelligent , veronica has a chance to enter marco's world , albeit not as his wife . 

she decides to become a courtesan -- a class of women who were as well-educated as they were ravishing , and sold their sexuality to wealthy men for the privilege of wining and dining with the elite . 

a courtesan was not a mere prostitute ; they were afforded a special place in society , and they were greatly revered , respected , and often envied . 

at one point , a character mentions that some rulers obtain more political advice from their courtesans than from their lieutenants . 

veronica goes through the transformation with the help of her mother , paola ( jacqueline bisset ) , who was once a famed courtesan herself . 

once she enters the lifestyle , veronica finds that it suits her quite well . 

she is allowed to read all the books she wants , she is given the opportunity to publish her poetry , and she has the richest and most powerful men in the republic throwing themselves at her feet , including the awestruck marco . 

their relationship develops into a playful bantering , with veronica utilizing her newfound power by constantly rejecting marco's advances . 

in many ways , their relationship is sad because marco is married to a women he is unable to love , and veronica is consumed by multiple relationships with men she is unwilling to love . 

 "" love the love , not the man , "" as her mother told her . 

 "" dangerous beauty , "" which was based on a factual book by margaret rosenthal , flows along as smoothly and serenely as the grand canal running through the heart of venice . 

it has multiple plot lines -- including veronica's adversarial relationship with a court poet ( oliver platt ) , her role in obtaining france's military assistance in venice's battle against the turks , and even the dreaded shadow of the plague and the encroachment of the spanish inquisition -- yet it is never confusing or overbearing . 

much of the film's success is due to the glowing performance by catherine mccormack in the lead role . 

known chiefly for the small part she played as the lover whose murder raised mel gibson's ire in "" braveheart "" ( 1995 ) , mccormack shows the true gifts and inarguable talent of a leading lady . 

she has the kind of exquisite classical beauty that would be treasured in a courtesan ; her character is intelligent , witty , and both sensual and vulnerable , all of which mccormack easily transmits with a single flash of her eyes . 

the rest of the roles are also filled well , including rufus sewell whose performance here and earlier this month in "" dark city "" have assured him a solid place in hollywood . 

he has the same kind of unusual good looks and charm of ray liotta , and he seems perfectly at home in period dramas . 

oliver platt plays a variation of the comic relief role that he has come to inhabit like a second skin , although the film deals his character a cheap blow at the end by having him improbably join the inquisition and turn into the bad guy . 

platt is a good actor , but he's just too hard to hate . 

jacqueline bisset proves that she is every bit as stirring as she ever was , and even fred ward turns up in a small , but moving performance as marco's uncle . 

 "" dangerous beauty "" is marshall herskovitz's sophomore directorial effort , after the overlooked 1993 film "" jack the bear . "" 

partnered with edward zwick , herskovitz has spent most of his time as a producer on television ( "" thirtysomething , "" "" my so-called life "" ) and in the movies ( "" legends of the fall "" ) . 

his directing style can be best described as transparent -- it never gets in the way of the story , yet it has no discernible flourish or particular distinctions . 

he could have approached the film in any number of ways , including overdosing on the sexual aspect , which he wisely avoids . 

 "" dangerous beauty "" contains just enough bare flesh and ribald sex to make it appropriately erotic , but not so much that it seems exploitative . 

herskovitz is also aided by a strong supporting crew , including the luscious photography by bojan bazelli , whose previous efforts include the highly-stylized thriller "" kalifornia "" ( 1993 ) and abel ferrara's dark sci-fi film "" body snatchers "" ( 1994 ) . 

bazelli captures the film in strong , bold colors , and be brings sixteenth-century venice to life in wide , panoramic shots that are often enhanced with digital imagery . 

however , the real details are found in the production design by norman garwood ( "" brazil , "" "" the princess bride "" ) and the costumes by gabriella pescucci ( "" the age of innocence "" ) . 

the only problem with "" dangerous beauty "" is that it doesn't stick with you . 

it's a good story well-told with interesting characters , but it's easy to shrug off once you've left the theater . 

the only sequence that has the chance to be truly indelible is veronica being pulled in front of the hypocrisy of the inquisition and threatened with the death penalty for her transgressions , but it never quite comes off because it's simply too melodramatic and conventional . 

herskovitz tries with all his might to make it a nailbiter , but somehow its outcome is a foregone conclusion , and like the rest of the film , it carries no real weight , despite the potential severity of the subject matter .

"as i walked out of crouching tiger , hidden dragon i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film . 

with the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a "" great "" piece of work and viceversa . 

attempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs . 

i avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology . 

as the word implies , a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master . 

as such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality . 

crouching tiger , hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category . 

crouching tiger , hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore , with the requisite blend of legend , fantasy , magic and mythology . 

it is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half-gods - greater than life , purer than life , stronger than life , physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats , but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable . 

all the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix , including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement . 

the classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop , with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil , which must choose between the two . 

it is the gifted pupil who , under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend . 

the elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment ( a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters ) are poignantly represented . 

the paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively . 

the fight scenes are stunning balletic tours-de-force , not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art , as are the prodigious leaps and flights to , from and between rooftops , the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of a lake . 

there need be no question of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry . 

as in a wagnerian opera there is a substantial story line , which takes place at an ordinary human level , yet the entire project is to be accepted as a work of art rooted in fantasy . 

do not assume , however , that the art is limp-wristed . 

for those who are put off by the "" art "" label this film can be confidently recommended as engrossing entertainment at the levels of adventure , action and romance . 

there are no weak performances in this movie . 

michelle yeoh imbues her character with depth , humanity and wisdom . 

chow yon fat projects dignity and purity of heart . 

zhang ziyi is a budding superstar . 

she is radiantly beautiful and totally persuasive in a multifaceted role . 

cheng pei pei as the evil master and chang cheng as the bandit prince acquit themselves admirably . 

kudos to screenwriters james schamus , wang hui ling and tsai kuo jing , choreographer yuen wo-ping , photography director peter pau and music director tan dun , each of which contribute quality components to this extraordinary film . 

ang lee as the director , co-producer and mastermind of the project gets the lion share of the credit . 

this is destined to be one of those films that everybody likes , including those who hate martial arts movies . 

don't miss it . 
"
"senseless is a prime example of what can happen when you try to push a one-joke concept a bit too far . 

director penelope spheeris is no stranger to this , having subjected audiences before to such tortures as the beverly hillbillies . 

marlon wayans stars as darryl witherspoon , a college senior vying for a lucrative job at a prominent brokerage . 

however , he lacks the advantages of his chief opposition , scott thorpe ( david spade , in the smarmy sort of role he can deliver in his sleep ) : an athletic record , sponsorship by a fraternity , and , most of all , a wealthy family to back him up . 

in fact , darryl has to work at four jobs simply to make ends meet . 

but there may be a light at the end of that tunnel . 

he signs up as a human guinea pig in a neurological experiment run by the university's dr . wheedon ( brad dourif ) . 

as a result , his senses are magnified tenfold . 

using his newfound abilities , he sets himself in complete pursuit of the job ( unaware that there may be some disadvantageous side-effects to having super senses ) . 

naturally , marlon wayans plays this comedy at full throttle , giving jim carrey-ish amounts of physical humor . 

the problem is , aside from a few genuinely inspired bits , there's not much that's funny here . 

the film has it's one central gag , and pads out the rest of its length with rather obvious lowbrow humor . 

there obviously wasn't much thought put into the plot . 

the entire job selection process is completely ridiculous . 

i mean , why the emphasis on extra-curricular activities if the entire job is going to come down to a single-elimination quiz anyhow ? 

and is this the only job being offered to economics majors this semester ? 

to give it credit , senseless does try to create a secondary joke with darryl's roommate , tim laflour ( matthew lillard ) . 

apparently , he is supposed to be faddish , but the film never does anything with him , leaving him in a piercing phase throughout the movie . 

his "" intervention "" scenes with darryl , however , do provide a rare , and welcome , laugh . 

and then there's the love interest which is always pathetically tacked onto comedies like this one . 

in this case , the object of darryl's amor is janice ( tamara taylor ) , a fellow student who won't have anything to do with darryl until he gains his super-senses . 

needless to say , the romance is completely extraneous , and adds little to the film . 

this is a film that desperately needed something else . 

be that a good plot , more jokes ( or simply funnier ones ) , or a strong character or two , anything would have helped senseless get off the ground . 

as it is , all the manic exuberant mugging in the world can't help marlon wayans get this one off the ground .

"it was with great trepidation that i approached +mary+ , the farrelly brothers+ latest film . 

i knew the film would be funny--the trailer alone had me laugh harder than the actual comedy i went to see . 

but i also knew the film would be an equal-opportunity offender , attacking the sensibilities of the politically correct with reckless abandon . 

i figured the film would be raunchy , maybe another lucky escapee from nc-17 hell . 

i may laugh , but would i feel better in the morning ? 

i needn+t have worried . 

+mary+ is the sweetest , warmest , all-out laugh-and-grossfest this side of _animal house_ . 

surprisingly , the farrelly brothers have walked that very tight line of making a touching romantic comedy on the side , and filling the details with five or six outrageous howlers . 

they make laughter , the toughest job for a filmmaker to do , look easy . 

the plot is typical . 

thirteen years ago , geeky ted ( ben stiller ) lucked out in having dazzling mary ( cameron diaz ) go with him to the senior prom . 

as luck would have it , on that very day , he was hospitalized . 

why , i shall not tell , but i assure you , it isn+t pretty . 

he hires a private investigator to find her : pat healy ( matt dillon ) . 

he becomes one of the great comic villains . 

upon finding her , he too is lovestruck , and so pursues her , lying about his occupation and getting his teeth capped . 

it is only a matter of time before ted finds out that he had been double-crossed , and goes to get her for himself . 

would the geek get the girl ? 

puh-lease . 

the ending is pure hollywood ; no surprises there . 

but the absolute joy in this film is how this simple premise allows for humor in zippers , hair gel , the mentally disabled , the physically handicapped , interracial marriages , homosexuals , skin conditions , serial killers , tanning , and drugged-up dogs . 

the dog on speed sequence alone is worth the price of admission , and belongs in the film comedy hall of fame . 

and yet , for all the targets that are hit , the film maintains its sweet tone . 

mary , playing the straight role , is as sweet and caring as she is beautiful . 

she is totally devoted to caring for her mentally handicapped brother , warren ( w . 

earl brown--miles away from the cameraman in _scream_ ) . 

mary+s sunniness carries the film here--it compliments the below-belt gags that come at you . 

cameron diaz makes her totally charming , and the audience respects her , even though women in general do not usually undress before an open window . 

ben stiller also fares very well , totally changing his image from his _reality bites_ and _flirting with disaster_ straight men to being a , ( how to say it ? ) , a complete loser . 

braces , greasy long hair , not too bright , and very very funny . 

dillon is exceptionally creepy , especially with his capped teeth . 

and rounding out the cast is ted+s friend dom ( chris elliot ) , tanning addict magda ( lin shaye ) , modern troubador/greek chorus ron lichman , and mary+s sweet mom , markie post ( where has she been ? ! ) . 

not everything works . 

chris elliot+s role , skin blemishes and all , becomes merely tasteless and boring . 

there+s lousy dialogue about eight-minute vs . seven minute exercise tapes . 

and there are long stretches without much going on . 

but the wait is worth it . 

when those extraordinary sequences hit , the entire theater erupted with howls , tears . 

belly-aches , that in some sequences carried over to the following scene . 

the farrelly brothers have finally done it . 

yes , there are some raunchy bits , but when it is all over , it+s not nearly as bad as it could have been . 

while tasteless , it didn+t cross any lines , at least not with me . 

while raunchy , it wasn+t nearly as bad as _porky+s_ or _boogie nights_ . 

and it is sweet enough to be considered a date flick . 

after the funny but sour _kingpin_ left a negative aftertaste in my palate , comes the funniest sex farce since _a fish called wanda_ . 

approach this with an open mind , and you will reap the benefits hugely .

"mugshot ( director/writer/cinematographer/editor : matt mahurin ; cast : belinda becker ( stella ) , michael williams ( rumor ) , robert knepper ( joe/chris ) , robert walker ( random ) , willie lassic ( young brother of rumor ) , maxine joiner ( rumor's mother ) ; runtime : 87 ; mortal films ; 1995 ) 

reviewed by dennis schwartz 

a bleak indie film about a stolen identity . 

there's not much more to this visually stylish film than what meets the eye , as it relies on shock to tell its story of a prolonged vicious mugging . 

it falls into the category of being a pretentious art-house film , leaving a bitter taste in one's mouth as it stereotypes its characters and unintentionally further inflames the racial issues . 

it tries to make a heavy-handed point about disenfranchised black youths trapped by their environment , with their only way out being crime . 

but the story is so filled with violence and its nyc setting looks like hell , that it's hard to enjoy this film and to follow what the logic in the story is supposed to mean . 

the relationship between the black mugger and his white victim is a cloudy one , which the film never determines what it wants to say about it . 

matt mahurin is virtual one-man crew in putting this film together ( director/writer /cinematographer/editor ) , who is a still photographer in his day job . 

the film works best as a visually challenging piece , as each shot looks like a photograph carefully telling the story unfolding . 

a white photographer ( robert knepper ) is mugged by a black gang while he's on a freelance assignment to take a photo shoot of harlem at night . 

he becomes a victim of amnesia and his head is bloodied as he's left in a deserted harlem building , as the gang leaves him for dead ; but , one of the muggers , rumor ( michael williams ) , comes back and pretends to help him . 

he's a would-be photographer , who keeps a scrapbook entitled mugshots in the project apartment he shares with his mother and younger brother . 

keeping his victim in the dark about who he is by calling him joe and not telling him what's happening , he becomes the photographer for a few days . 

he enters the photographer's stylish greenwich village apartment and steals his expensive camera , and decides to hold the mugging vic for ransom when he finds out he has a black girlfriend , stella ( belinda becker ) . 

she's the only one in the film who could act . 

the film is stuck with a clumsy dialogue and an overuse of symbolism , as it ends with nothing more to tell after the shock and the violent situation it created except to beat it into the ground . 

it could only be commended for how appealing the film looks , as if it's a scrapbook of still photos put together to celebrate a mugging .

"when i first heard that disney's next animated feature was going to be tarzan , i was almost horrified . 

i was worried that disney was going to make another hercules ( sorry , jerk-ules ) . 

that effort was too overloaded with comedy ( and the hero was too boastful and pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero ) , and , after viewing it to this day , i find it a disgrace for disney animation . 

when i saw the trailers , i was thinking "" hmm . . . 

this isn't bad at all . 

this just might have potential . "" 

when i bought the soundtrack , i was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features . 

i have never really heard of phil collins , nor have i heard of mark mancina , so i was wondering , how would these two make this disney flick spin ? 

i was pleasantly surprised : the music is top-notch . 

phil collins' songs are terrific , percussion-heavy pieces of work that seem to break the formula for typical disney songs . 

the score from mark mancina was also neat ; it reminded me a bit of the lion king , but it was more original . 

so , the soundtrack wasn't bad at all , considering it was by two people i am not familiar with . 

this film could be good . . . 

but will it be ? 

when i finally went to see it ( on opening day , as i tend to do with most disney animated features ) , my question was answered , in a complete turnabout of expectations for me : disney's tarzan is surprisingly decent . 

the story starts out with tarzan's parents surviving a shipwreck and finding a home on an island where apes live in peace . 

however , one day , a vicious leopard , sabor , attacks and kills tarzan's parents , leaving him ( at this time , a baby ) alone-until kala of the apes rescues him . 

kala wants to raise the child as her own ( she lost hers previously to sabor ) , but her mate , kerchak is not too sure . 

 "" it's not our kind , "" he says . 

he agrees , though , to let her take care of little tarzan , but "" that doesn't make him my son . "" 

tarzan grows up , vowing to be "" the best ape ever "" , but no matter how hard he tries or what he does ( at the guidance of his hilarious ape friend , terk ) , he just can't convince kerchak that he is one of the apes , even when he defeats sabor in a battle . 

one day , a new animal shows up : humans . 

this is where jane comes into the picture . 

she is on an expedition with her father ( professor porter ) , and a despicable hunter ( clayton ) searching for gorillas . 

tarzan rescues her when she is chased by baboons , and soon they get to know each other . 

even though tarzan falls in love with jane , this causes things to go wrong . 

clayton tricks tarzan into taking him , jane , and porter to see the apes , who are convinced that he has betrayed them . 

worse , clayton has plotted to send the gorillas to london for money . 

will tarzan find out which family he belongs to and save the apes ? 

i'm not gonna tell you , sorry . 

you're gonna have to see for yourself . 

and see it you should ; the animation is , as always , top notch , particularly when tarzan goes soaring through the trees ( read that , skateboarding ) . 

the deep canvas computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to the jungle which tarzan lives in . 

in fact , it seems similar to the computer imagery/cel animation combination in rival disney animted films , such as fox's anastasia and dreamworks' prince of egypt . 

could it be that disney was actually taking ideas from their rivals ? 

the casting is fairly good . 

tony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan ( and to my relief , the animators have succeeded in not making him another hercules . 

nicely done ) , and glenn close is wonderful as kala ( she has a beautiful singing voice , too , by the way ) . 

lance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson's beast voice , which makes him all the more ferocious and gripping . 

minnie driver had me a little worried at first as the voice of jane . 

i thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole film ( when i first saw the trailers ) , but when i saw the film , i didn't have a problem with her . 

i take back my insult on driver . 

it's nice to hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for a disney animated feature ( he was fflewdurr flamm in disney's most underrated classic , the black cauldron ) ; he is funny and delightful as professor porter . 

on the villiany side of the voices , brian blessed ( the guy who did boss nass in star wars : episode i-the phantom menace ) brings a pompous , and later on vicious , voice to the sinister clayton . 

he might not be the strongest character in the film ( he's just a plain bad guy , nothing else ) , but blessed's vocal work contributes greatly . 

but if there is any voice that i think steals the whole show , it should be rosie o'donnell , who is hilariously funny as terk . 

she also has a fiesty attitude ( "" i'm gonna kill ya ! "" 

she says , more than once ) . 

i almost sung along with her during one of the film's best moments , where the apes make a mess of the human's camp , via song , er , scatting "" shoo-be-doo , da-be-dah "" . 

i can see why she wanted to have a rock song for the film , she's a good singer . 

not that she was the only funny character in the film , though . 

wayne knight ( who played stan in space jam ) gives a whimsically funny style to tantor , an elephant who is especially worried about stepping into "" un-sanitary "" water . 

 ( thankfully , there is no real sound of flatuence-that would have killed the picture ) . 

the songs , as i said before , are decent , mostly sung by collins . 

this sets a new standard for disney animated films because for the first time , the characters do not sing . 

i tolerate musical numbers from characters a lot more than some other guys would , but i found this to be a nice change of pace . 

the story does have elements of comedy in it , but they also load it with strong dramatic touches , which makes this film far better than the unbelieveably uninspired hercules . 

if there is anything disappointing about tarzan , it might be the omission of the 'n sync version of "" trashing the camp "" from the film . 

i heard it on the soundtrack , and wondered where it was going to be . 

i was upset that it wasn't , because i had thought of taking a few friends of mine who like 'n sync to see tarzan . 

oh , well . . . 

overall , i was enthralled with tarzan . 

i wouldn't hold it high the way i do with mulan or the hunchback of notre dame ( my all-time favorite disney classics ) , but this film deserves a high place among disney's greatest achievements . 

i give a nod to disney for following up their spectacular * * * * * masterpiece , mulan , with this great animated adaption of egar rice burrough's tarzan .

"notice : this is a review and analysis of exotica . 

the first part of this piece is the review , the second part contains some analysis of the movie which might be construed as spoilers . 

if you have not seen the movie and after reading the first part you intend to do so , then save the second part for the discussion afterwards . 

starring : bruce greenwood , mia kirshner , elias kosteas , don mckellar , arsinee khanijian , sarah polley director : atom egoyan screenplay : atom egoyan 

exotica is a film that grows on retrospection . 

exotica keeps the viewer guessing about the relationship between the various characters in the film . 

all of the people know each other , but apart from that , there seems to be no other reason why to select such set and follow them in this fictional account . 

the director hints for possible solutions , using a multi-line plot , so popular with critics in mystery train , and used to good advantage by quentin tarantino in pulp fiction . 

exotica reaches a whole new dimension using this technique . 

at the end it is surprising to see how well the pieces of the puzzle fit together , in spite their apparent unconnectedness and even misleading features . 

the out-of-chronological-order technique has become ever so popular , perhaps even de rigueur , for biographical films . 

similarly , we can now expect to see more movies in the future which will use , to varying extent , converging multiplots . 

on a first glance , once the multi-plot puzzle in exotica is solved , there seems to be little left to look at . 

but perceptive minds which take the time to dig further will be rewarded with interesting views on life or rather , commentaries on views of life . 

exotica is very much worth seeing . 

it opened to critic's praise worldwide ( i first saw it in mexico city , last december ) . 

in canada , it broke records for a movie of its kind , which prompted the american distributor to go for a wide release . 

apart from a strong plot , acting is very convincing , and the soundtrack seems as if made for the movie . 

the spoon-fed-entertainment crowd may not appreciate this movie , and thus it might last little on screen . 

but if you want to try a movie a cut above the crowd , with an originality that is ever so rare , by all means see exotica . 

analysis ( * * spoilers * * ahead ) 

what is behind the complex plot in exotica ? 

first , a common theme of the quest for gratification by monetary means . 

the lone tax-auditor , the repressed homosexual pet shop owner , the pregnant woman which runs the nightclub , the rich man which has the club remodeled , the audience at the movie theatre , all use personal wealth to buy palliative relief for the penuries of the soul . . . . 

then we have the quest for gratification through visual means by most of the same people , including those who sit watching exotica . . . . 

in that regard exotica stands for onlookers at a nightclub , for the rich man looking through silver mirrors , and poor-rich people looking at other's people lives through a silver screen . 

exotica also stands for unwanted society attention into the lives of other people , such as the tax auditor and the pet shop owner . 

exotica is the customer agent looking at the pet shop owner , which in turn is looking at the core of the problems between the strip dancer and the tax auditor through the detached eye of a gay person ( no attraction to the strip dancer ) , and only interested on avoiding jail ( no personal relationship with the tax auditor ) . 

in exotica everybody is watching , and what is worse , everybody knows . 

second , exotica is about isolated people holding back their feelings ; about people which by voluntary or involuntary means transfer their view of reality to other characters . 

the strip dancer becomes the proverbial daughter , the dj becomes the proverbial killer by means of breaking the relationship between the father and the proverbial daughter . 

the niece becomes the baby sitter , the baby sitter becomes the dancer , and the dancer becomes the proverbial daughter . 

the pet shop owner becomes the proverbial dj , by finding the proverbial daughter . 

a chain made of real and imagined links coming around full circle , just as everything comes around to a fitting whole at the end of the movie .

"robocop is an intelligent science fiction thriller and social satire , one with class and style . 

the film , set in old detroit in the year 1991 , stars peter weller as murphy , a lieutenant on the city's police force . 

1991's detroit suffers from rampant crime and a police department run by a private contractor ( security concepts inc . ) whose employees ( the cops ) are threatening to strike . 

to make matters worse , a savage group of cop-killers has been terrorizing the city . 

on murphy's first day of duty , after his transfer from another precinct , these cop-killers brutally murder him by shooting off his limbs one by one . 

 ( orion pictures had to edit this extremely graphic scene in order to get an r rating from the m . p . a . a . ) 

after the emergency room staff at the hospital cannot save murphy and declare him clinically dead , s . c . i . 

recruits his remains for their new "" robocop "" program . 

using the remains of murphy's body as a foundation , their scientists build a cyborg , made of both flesh and metal . 

the cyborg ( robocop ) is half human ( murphy ) and half robot ; the s . c . i . 

engineers have erased murphy's memory and replaced it with a computer program ( or so they think ) . 

with his lightning quick reflexes , immense strength , and impenetrable armor , s . c . i . 

envisions robocop as an indestructible super-cop : the solution to detroit's problems . 

the remainder of the plot follows robocop's crime-foiling and vengeance on his murderers . 

as a science fiction action-thriller , robocop is extremely effective . 

dutch director paul verhoeven combines gritty action with suspense , shocking gore , and spectacular special effects . 

several sequences in the film , such as the one in which robocop employs his extremely precise aim to stop a rapist , are destined to become cult-classics . 

because robocop is so visually and emotionally rousing , it demands to be seen on a large screen with an audience--in other words , in a movie theater . 

although the special effects and action are exciting , they do not by themselves set robocop apart from other films in the genre . 

rather , robocop stands out for its accurate and biting satire of american society . 

the movie makes a mockery of the star wars defense initiative , terrorism , board games , and television news broadcasts with air-headed anchors . 

these news broadcasts , which are exceptionally clever , recur periodically throughout the movie and help to provide comic relief from the intense action and gore . 

the satire in robocop , however , is almost as frightening in its own way as the suspense and blood . 

1990's america , as portrayed in the film , may seem far fetched but is in actuality ( i think ) only a slight exaggeration of the current state of american society . 

the humorous satire in robocop is simultaneously credible and absurd . 

verhoeven adroitly balances the satirical comedy with the gory action to create an entertaining and enlightening piece of science fiction/social commentary . 

unfortunately , robocop possesses several flaws which prevent it from qualifying as a classic within the genre . 

the movie lacks the lasting impact of such films as the road warrior , the terminator , and aliens . 

robocop's main problem , aside from its dumb title , is that it does not sufficiently develop murphy's character . 

we never learn the degree to which murphy ( as robocop ) is human and the degree to which he is a robot . 

does murphy have any human spirit or free will left , or is he merely a computer following a program ? 

the script halfheartedly raises these issues but then abandons them in its climactic flurry of gory action . 

moreover , it almost completely ignores the question ( and tragedy ) of denying a man his right to die in favor of turning him into a machine . 

robocop also contains several bothersome loose-ends . 

as you watch robocop , you experience deja vu ; you feel as if you have seen the film before . 

in many respects , robocop is reminiscent of several other films , including the terminator , return of the jedi , and even death wish . 

however , to its credit , robocop easily has enough originality and unique personality to avoid becoming a cheap rip-off .

"when i watch a movie like mike nichols' what planet are you from ? 

i can't help but feel like everyone is looking at me . 

it's as if all the audience is gazing at the back of my head in the darkness , eyes shooting daggers , quietly blaming me for the fact that they paid hard-earned money to spend their time watching this . . . 

this . . . 

thing . 

i shift uncomfortably in my seat . 

i'm reminded of how i feel when i see a pair of second- or third-rate celebrities engaging in a teleprompted "" funny "" conversation to introduce the next blockbuster award . 

it's not my fault , i know it's not my fault , but dammit , someone's gotta be embarrassed , because it doesn't look like anyone on the screen is ready to take the blame . 

i'm about to give you a list of names of people who are gonna make a movie together : garry shandling , annette bening , john goodman , greg kinnear , mike nichols . 

do any of these names make you instantly shudder ? 

the answer i would have come up with before today is no , this is quite a list of talented individuals we've got here . 

granted , john goodman was in the flintstones , and greg kinnear has turned in some less-than-lackluster leading man performances in certified failures like a smile like yours , but even so , they've got proven power as excellent supporting players . 

garry shandling has two television classics under his belt , his ingenious little it's garry shandling's show and the larry sanders show . 

and for god's sake , mike nichols directed the graduate , and annette bening is just walking away from american beauty . 

so explain this . . . 

this . . . 

thing . 

what planet are you from ? 

purports to be a comedy exploring the relationship between men and women satirizing the whole pop-psychology mars/venus phenomenon . 

but what this movie winds up being is a collection of unfunny cringe-inducing moments coupled with uninsightful cringe-inducing moments ; the end result is , unsurprisingly , an unfunny , uninsightful , cringe-inducing , thoroughly icky embarrassment . 

garry shandling plays an alien from a planet populated by technologically advanced but emotionally vacant males ( they reproduce through cloning , of course ) . 

his leaders put a select group of males through a series of tests designed to determine which one is most fit to fly off to earth , find a female of the species , and impregnate her . 

they're taught how to pretend that they're listening by nodding and saying "" uh-huh , "" and how to compliment shoes . 

imagine my delighted surprise when , oh heavens , all their carefully practiced tactics turn out to fail miserably , producing comedic results ! 

the lucky winner is fitted with a penis ( since theirs , after generations of disuse have long since shrunk out of existence . . . 

i will restrain myself from mentioning the implausibility of such a scenario since the population has stopped evolving due to the fact that they're all just clones . . . 

whoops , too late . ) 

the penis , when aroused , tends to make a humming noise . 

the writers , when frequently strapped for ideas , tend to turn to this as a source of "" comedy . "" 

it isn't funny the first time . 

it isn't funny the eighth time . 

it isn't funny the eighteenth time . 

if anything , it made me feel vaguely self-conscious . 

garry meets up with a coworker at a bank played by greg kinnear , who turns out to be a generic , unlikable scumbag . 

he's meant to fill the part of unfortunate role model for shandling's alien character , but he's so flatly drawn that even the writers quickly give up and toss him aside . 

kinnear's scumbagginess is demonstrated by the fact that he claims other peoples' work as his own to worm his way into a vice presidents' position and goes to aa meetings to pick up chicks . 

wow . 

what a magnificent bastard . 

nearly every man in the movie , in fact , is played as the same sort of sex-driven slimeball . 

when kinnear's wife walks into the office , there isn't a single guy who doesn't trip , bump into a wall , or otherwise pratfall as if they'd never seen a woman before . 

the few guys that aren't particularly slimeballs , such as john goodman's detective character , are simply uncommunicative workaholics . 

shandling meets up with annette bening , who will inevitably prove to be the love he never knew existed , at one of kinnear's aa meetings . 

shandling's mission is to have a baby , and when he reveals his desires to her , bening instantly falls for him , and the next day . . . 

they get married . 

yup . 

the next day . 

cuz ya see , it turns out she wants a baby too ! 

bening's character perhaps was the most difficult to watch , especially after seeing her come apart at the seams so effectively in american beauty . . . 

if her character here is supposed to be representing the female of the species as a whole , then woe , i say , to the species . 

she's unfathomably insecure , and succumbs so easily to all of shandling's lines and lies that it borders on tragic . 

there's a point where , after thinking she may not be able to bear children , she learns that she is indeed pregnant . 

when garry comes home after nearly cheating on her , she strolls into the kitchen and sings "" high hopes "" ( you know , the uplifting ant and the rubber tree plant song ) to deliver the news , and then says to him , "" now you can't leave me . "" 

we're supposed to empathize with shandling's discovery of the feeling of "" guilt , "" but instead i wanted to weep for bening that she was placing her entire life and soul firmly in the lap of a great big nothing . 

and eventually , shandling falls in love with her . . . 

for real , i suppose , though i'm not sure exactly what prompted it . 

what's the message i derive from all this ? 

men are liars , inherently empty creatures , but if you hang around long enough . . . 

well , maybe something will click . 

ha ha . . . 

ha ? 

i'm thankful such broad cynicism isn't frequently allowed to run so rampant . 

let's all join hands and pray that the planet these folks are from is not this one . 

there's also a subplot involving john goodman as an airline incident investigator that wades in the bog of stupidity . 

goodman , through a series of astoundingly implausible realizations , puts together the fact that shandling is a being from another world with a magic , vibrating penis . 

it has all the makings for a subplot of having shandling be discovered , that , thankfully , never comes to the inevitable hackneyed fruition . 

instead , it just dangles limply on the branch for a while , withers , and falls away . 

further proof that goodman should just stick to doing coen brothers movies . 

but let's not dwell on this any longer , i've already wasted plenty of your time and my own . 

let's move on , forget about what we've seen here , and get on with our lives . 

and to help us out , let's end things on a happy note . . . 

congratuations go out to annette bening , winner of this week's "" title ! "" 

award , for delivering the awkward line of dialog containing the movie's name . 
"
"this is the last carry on film with its almost intact regular cast and it is the swansong of hattie jacques and sid james . 

dick turpin ( sid james ) and his gang which includes harriett/harry ( barbara windsor ) and tom "" doc "" scholl ( peter butterworth ) , terrorise the countryside by staging highway robberies : "" stand and deliver ! "" 

owing to the increased occurrence of turpin's robberies , captain desmond fancey of the bow street runners ( kenneth williams ) and his sidekick sergeant jock strapp ( jack douglas ) visit turpin's area of influence to bring him to justice . 

they are under the express orders of sir roger daley ( bernard bresslaw ) . 

their intellect does not count for much and when they increasingly become suspicious of reverend flasher aka dick turpin ( sid james ) , whom they confided in earlier , they still cannot believe that the rector has any part in these robberies . 

however , once they catch harriett and put her in jail , and sir roger daley takes complete charge , it seems that there is no hope for dick turpin . 

then again , sir roger has assigned the dimwits fancey and jock strapp aswell as the old dithering constable ( kenneth connor ) to keep an eye on their prisoner ! 

there is no doubt that this is a 'sid james' carry on movie . 

he excels in double roles ( as in 'carry on- don't lose your head' ) and his performance as flasher and turpin is hilarious . 

barbara windsor is also funny as harriett the sex mad housemaid and member of the gang , and hattie jacques' small but effective role as the rector's housekeeper martha hoggett is played to perfection . 

jack douglas plays a milder version of his excruciatingly annoying on-screen persona and kenneth williams is given a rather mundane part . 

peter butterworth is not allowed to shine in his boring performance as tom , and bernard bresslaw's character appears only briefly in the film . 

the only notable performance from the support cast comes from joan sims as madame desiree , who is travelling around the country escorting her starlets the 'birds of paradise' and sporting a fake french accent . 

when her girls and her are robbed by turpin , she is determined to catch him and helps the reverend to find the culprit ! 

a carry on by the numbers , this movie is only notable for the great performance by sid james in his last carry on movie . 

the jokes are bluer , the script is poorer ( it is the last script written by talbot rothwell ) , but the music is a marked improvement . 

although nearly all the regulars appear , they seem to be just going through the motions . 

none of the high spirits of the earlier films are apparent here . 

just a selection of crude jokes and repititive double-entendres .

"the happy bastard's 30-second review : 

american pie 

the summer of raunch continues to spread into theatres with this latest yuk fest , filled with sick jokes and teen dialogue aplenty . 

if you go expecting dawson's creek , you're in for a problem . 

if your expectations are lower ( and better , i might add ) , you will enjoy the hell out of american pie . 

the movie casts several unknowns , with the only real recognizable one being sctv's own eugene levy as a happy-go-lucky dad . 

the story revolves around four high school seniors who have one goal before the school year gets out- get laid . 

that's pretty much it . 

throughout the movie , little sick comic bits are sprinkled throughout , including a memorable scene involving an apple pie ( i won't give it away , but you probably know what it is ) and an internet broadcast gone horribly awry . 

of course , the movie has some slightly sentimental bits , but they don't drag the movie's humor content down that bad . 

most of the actors get their job done , but it's levy who's a hoot , a father who tries to talk sex with his son with the help of some curious "" visual aids "" . 

i couldn't stop laughing during this movie , and if you can stand all the raunch and the sex references , then american pie is for you . 

if you're one of those "" conservative "" types , well , i'll bet you're having fun at home while this , south park , and austin powers ii plays in theatres , now aren't you ? 
"
"quentin tarantino seems to have a knack for giving his stars big careers . 

after his pulp fiction , many actors began receiving many offers for jobs . 

john travolta made his come-back and is now one of today's most bankable stars . 

bruce willis proved his acting chops and is now considered an actual actor . 

jackie brown , on the other hand , boasts quite a well known cast , except for the main lead : pam grier . 

most likely you have heard of her and seen her in films , but she's never really had a breakthrough performance ( her first film was in the roger ebert-written beyond the valley of the dolls ) . 

that is , until now . 

jackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino , whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction . 

after mediocre acting jobs , tarantino returns to what made his name a household one : directing and writing . 

jackie brown is the result , and it is fantastic entertainment . 

despite excellent direction from tarantino , the cast steals the film , giving one good performance after another . 

pam grier gives a stunning performance as jackie brown , and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent--samuel l . jackson , bridget fonda , michael keaton , robert de niro , and robert forster . 

more than likely , you will see a few of these names in the oscar pool come oscar nominations . 

describing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult , as you really can't say much or you spoil it for everyone else . 

i will tread lightly . 

jackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown ( grier ) in a blue outfit walking through the airport . 

the camera tracks along with her , and ends up revealing her occupation . 

we are also introduced to ordell robbie ( jackson ) , who sells illegal guns to interested buyers . . . 

for a hefty price . 

ms . brown carries the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away . 

however , an fbi agent ( keaton ) and a local l . a . cop ( michael bowen ) are out to find ordell and catch him while taking the money . 

they try to reach him through beaumont livingston ( chris tucker ) , one of ordell's buyers , but he mysteriously ends up dead . 

they try again through brown , but she is hesitant to admit to any wrong-doing . 

but after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordell's friends ( fonda ) , she is caught and sent to jail . 

ordell pays her bail through a bail bond agent , max cherry ( forster ) , and then wants to find out what she told the cops . 

after she claims to have said nothing , she reveals the fact that she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison . 

ordell doesn't like this , but they both come up with a scheme to throw the feds and cops off their track . 

this scheme seems to be going as planned , but unexpected occurances may or may not foul up their goal . 

revealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown , and that's the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film . 

tarantino seems to have a fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments ( and slang terms ) , but they are always done very well and believably . 

his hitmen are normally cruel , but pleasant , in that nasty sort of way . 

they talk like normal people , except for when doing business , and they are rude to their girlfriends . 

of course , this is a tarantino film , and you know you can expect some awkward situations to arise . 

and perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace begins to drop . 

of course , tarantino fixes this by moving onto the climax of the film , adding a lot of his reservoir dogs-style storytelling to it . 

things are told from one person's perspective , and then from another , and then from another , each time learning more and more . 

this all leads up to a very interesting conclusion , which decides who is on whose side . 

on the technical side of jackie brown , quentin tarantino directs it with the same style as he did with his 1994 film . 

however , this time around it isn't as nearly as impressive or original . 

the writing , on the other hand , is quite good , although i do find tarantino's use of slang terms offensive . 

the story jumps back and forth in time as in pulp fiction , but it's much more easy to understand . 

his previous film needed a second viewing in order to understand the time differentiation , but jackie brown is very simply to follow , especially considering that the time is given during the "" leaps "" in time . 

perhaps this is a result of the screenplay being written from the novel "" rum punch "" by elmore leonard . 

the dialogue is pretty much intelligent , and all the characters are fully realized . 

the cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro ( who has worked with tarantino on previous films ) and the editing is very good . 

and as with pulp fiction , the music is a highlight , bringing back memorable songs from the 70s and 80s . 

the acting side of jackie brown is unforgettable . 

the performances are incredibly rich , with hidden meaning behind every characters' actions . 

nothing is quite as it seems , and you can't really tell which side one person is on . 

the real treat , of course , is pam grier who gives an astonishing performance as jackie brown . 

her poor living conditions are superceded by her superior wits , which play an important role in the film . 

watching grieg , i could tell what was going through her mind , even if i didn't know what she was thinking . 

her face portrays a lot of emotion that you can tell when she is sad , happy , or in deep thought . 

bridget fonda gives a very good performance as a druggie couch potato . 

i didn't even realize it was fonda until i saw her name in the final credits ( her performance actually reminded me of heather graham's in boogie nights ) . 

michael keaton comes across very well , as does michael bowen . 

chris tucker has a small , but effective performance . 

samuel l . jackson is very good , but it seems to me that he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction ( although much less cynical ) . 

but no matter . . . 

jackson is very strong in his role . 

robert de niro is actually a little annoying at times , but overall he does a good job as one of ordell's perspective clients and friends . 

robert forster gives one of the best performances in the film , as he has one of the most developed characters . 

he is present throughout most of the film , and he holds his own against jackson and grier . 

jackie brown is rated r for language , sex , violence , drug use , and some offensive remarks . 

as a film by itself , jackie brown is a terrific piece of entertainment , with a complex plot to draw viewers in . 

however , one can not help but compare it to tarantino's pulp fiction , and expect great results . 

when compared , it comes up short , but not that short . 

it's a worthy effort , with terrific acting and some impressive writing from elmore leonard and tarantino . 

perhaps the best thing about jackie brown is the discovery of pam grier as a major hollywood actress . 

i can't remember seeing her in anything ( except for a small role in mars attacks ! ) , but hopefully she will get many more roles from this one . 

expect to see her name floating around the oscar nominations ( and hopefully she will even be able to nab one ) .

"apparently , when crap calls , jim carrey answers . 

here he is , mugging it up in countless unfunny ways for the fifth time , his second go-around in the role of pet detective ace ventura . 

that means more talking ass-cracks , penis jokes and cries of "" al-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-lrighty then . "" 

it all adds up to a sequel that makes the original resemble schindler's list in terms of dramatic merit , or lack of . 

granted , there are a few laughs amid the constant barrage of pre-school humor , but anyone who appreciates good comedy will bang their head against the wall ten times for every minor chuckle . 

it's a painful experience for anyone with a brain . 

ace is distraught after accidentally dropping a racoon into a canyon ( in a parody of the opening scene of sylvester stallone's cliffhanger , jim carrey being the only person who can make stallone look like a college professor in terms of intellect , or lack of ) and decides to retire to the mountains of tibet to gain a higher level of consciousness ( or , in his case , a level of consciousness ) . 

but he is pulled out of retirement to the tune of $20 , 000 to retrieve a sacred white bat for an african tribe . 

why africa ? 

so carrey can disguise himself nude inside a fake rhino and later climb out the rear end as a tourist family watches ( "" look , the rhino's about to give birth ! "" ) . 

if that seems like hee-haw humor to you , by all means , see the movie . 

if not , claim your place in human civilization with the rest of us . 

obviously , there are quite a few nonmembers of civilization who made this movie , like the first ace ventura film ( i use the word "" film "" only because it was filmed , not because there's any level of artistic merit . ) , a huge success . 

in fact , carrey only has a career because of the decline of intelligence in our culture . 

you may say to me , "" but andrew , look at jerry lewis . 

he was born with a negative i . q . 

and look how popular he was thirty years ago . "" 

maybe , but i still say jerry lewis is a notch or two up on the comedic ladder because he never actually did an impression in a movie of a rabid bulldog biting off a man's testicles . . . 

lewis at least had the dignity to save that performance for when company came over . 
"
"ingredients : london gal , fate , true love , running joke about monty python's spanish inquisition 

synopsis : american actress gwyneth paltrow with dark hair , playing a londoner ? 

believe it . 

sliding doors is a love 'what if' story . 

the gimmick is that it's really two stories : the film follows the life of helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) down two directions . 

in the beginning , likeable gal 'helen' ( gwyneth paltrow ) gets unexpectedly fired from her advertising job . 

so she goes into the subway train station meaning to return home early to her apartment and her sleeping live-in lover gerry ( john lynch ) . 

helen doesn't know it , but she is at a fateful junction in life : 1 ) if she enters through the sliding door of a london subway train her life takes one path with one future 2 ) if she stays on the platform her life takes another path with a different future . 

the film shows what happens in both paths , switching back and forth between intertwined , parallel stories . 

in story one , helen meets a charming and talkative monty python fan named james ( john hannah ) on the train . 

arriving home early , she discovers that her live-in , gerry ( john lynch ) , is having sex with his former lover lydia ( jeanne tripplehorn ) . 

this leads to a life where helen moves out . 

helen's winsome new friend james helps her recover from a broken heart , and encourages her to start her own business . 

in story two , helen experiences a different fate . 

she misses the train , never meets james , and doesn't get home early enough to discover gerry's infidelity . 

in this new life , helen takes up odd menial jobs , and faces the constant sneaking suspicion that all is not right with her relationship with gerry . 

will the truth of the heart finally work its way through a number of problems and setbacks in both scenarios ? 

opinion : rejoice all ye monty python fans , gwyneth paltrow fans , and watchers of quirky romance flicks . 

at last here's proof that there's still creativity in 1990s filmmaking . 

sliding doors is refreshingly different from anything this year . 

not only is it a well-acted , heartwarming film , but it's also easily gwyneth paltrow's best recent performance . 

when helen ( paltrow ) screams that her unfaithful boyfriend is a 'shagging wanker , ' ( a british phrase better left untranslated ) she sounds like she knows what she's talking about ! 

nor does sliding doors go overboard with formulaic true love or other stereotypes . 

nobody scrambles around in danger , screaming , "" i will find you no matter what , my darling ! "" 

when helen finds herself on a boat in the starlight with james , she doesn't take the easy way out and leap into his arms , since she's supposed to be recovering from heartache . 

and handsome live-in boyfriend gerry isn't the stereotypical screen hunk ( either a stud or a snob ) . 

instead he's a nervous and indecisive , almost helpless hunk . 

another example : when one of the protagonists lies wounded in a hospital , sliding doors gives us neither the 'hospital miracle' nor a maudlin tragedy but surprises us with a third variation . 

in other words , all of the characters seem non-stereotyped , human , and local . 

there are minor inconveniences . 

since sliding doors switches back and forth between two possible fates , it's occasionally difficult to distinguish between the two . 

distinguishing between the two stories isn't a problem in the scenes containing paltrow , who sports two different hairstyles . 

but in scenes containing only lydia and gerry , who look the same in both stories , it's slightly confusing . 

also , quite a few snappy comebacks referring to american pop culture ( seinfeld , woody allen , etc . ) are spoken by the british characters . 

but these seem slightly forced , given that the remaining dialogue is predominantly british slang . 

possibly an attempt by the screenwriter to balance the british so that american audiences can feel more comfortable ? 

sliding doors is a charming , quirky , original , happy romance with a little 'philosophy of fate' thrown in . 

monty python and the meaning of fate , anybody ?

"it's tough to be an aspiring superhero in champion city . 

just ask mr . furious ( ben stiller ) , the blue raja ( hank azaria ) , and the shoveler ( william h . macy ) . 

they're trying to break into the biz , but captain amazing ( greg kinnear ) , the city's hero numero uno , hogs all the action . 

the good captain has his own problems . 

because he's all but eliminated crime , amazing's endorsement deals are falling through . 

the public craves a major slugfest , so amazing engineers the parole of his one-time arch enemy casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) . 

frankenstein succeeds beyond expectations ; he captures capt . amazing before setting out on his scheme to destroy the city . 

so , no one is left to save the day but our would-be superheroes , but their abilities are more "" little league "" than "" justice league . "" 

the raja hurls forks at foes , the shoveler hits them with a shovel , and mr . furious just yells at people ( stiller is doing essentially the same character he played in a guest appearance on "" friends "" ) . 

after a painful first strike , the guys hold auditions for teammates and add the bowler ( janeane garofalo ) , who carries her dead father's skull in her bowling ball ; invisible boy ( kel mitchell ) , who can only use his powers when no one is looking at him ; the spleen ( paul reubens ) , who blows devastating winds from his rear ; and the sphinx ( wes studi ) , a mysterious figure who will teach them to fight . 

 "" mystery men "" boasts one of the most talented and eclectic casts ever assembled . 

in addition to those already mentioned , the credits include lena olin as frankenstein's evil shrink , comedian eddie izzard and the fugees' prakazrel michel as disco-themed thugs , singer tom waits as an inventor of superhero weapons , artie lange ( from "" mad tv "" ) as another thug , claire forlani ( from "" meet joe black "" ) as a waitress mr . furious is pursuing , louise lasser ( from "" mary hartman , mary hartman "" ) as the blue raja's mother , and actor/magician ricky jay as capt . amazing's manager . 

the cast includes four oscar-nominated actors ! 

when i saw the list of players early last year , i figured the result would be a can't-miss comedy . 

yet , i must report disappointment . 

the script is probably the worst of 1999 . 

nearly every joke misfires . 

the stabs at comic books are too obvious to be funny . 

 ( for example , no one can recognize capt . amazing in his secret identity because he's wearing glasses . ) 

the fart jokes surrounding the spleen are surprisingly the only gags that work . 

the cast tries hard , especially hank azaria , whose character adopts an effete british accent while in costume , but the script is just too lame to run . 
"
"maybe the most important thing about this movie is that it's not handled like the hallmark hall of fame movie of the month , because it very well could have been a manipulative tearjerker , broadcasted on abc on a monday night , starring kelly martin and yasmeen bleeth , respectively . 

because it's not handled like the greatest story ever told is precisely why it's so great . 

underneath the to-die-for cinematography , the brilliant acting , and incessantly wonderful direction is a film of modesty , not sure whether or not this story is totally great but with the balls to run with it , tell it in a certain original way . 

it doesn't merely go from plot point to plot point . 

it goes from character to character . 

it obsesses itself with the depth and the style of it all , and makes the story of a world-reknowned cellist who contracts ms and dies prematurely into the story of two sisters , both musicians , who have a totally unique relationship . 

it's that their relationship is the center of the story that makes this film transcend any cornball , shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it could have had and makes this , unlike "" patch adams , "" effortlessly emotional and real . 

in short , this movie is just awesome . 

it merely tells its story really well , and that's something that just has to be commended these days , when most stories are botched because they're not told by great storytellers . 

director anand tucker tells this story well . 

he overdramaticizes everything , but still keeps it real . 

the film tells the story of hilary and jacqueline du pr ? ( rachel griffiths and emily watson , respectively ) , two sisters who are first seen in childhood ( played by auriol evans and keely flanders , respectively ) as the very best of friends . 

they are also both musicians , hilary a flutist and jackie a cellist , and when it all begins , both are considered child prodigies , but hilary is seen as the better of the two . 

jackie , a bit jealous , works and works at her playing skills , and soon the tables are turned . 

when they both hit adulthood , hilary strives for a comeback , while her sister is playing in famous halls around the world , but instead of fame , captures the heart of a hapless , joyful conductor , kiffer finzi ( david morissey , in a semi-star-making turn ) . 

they marry , after a short courtship , and move to a lovely country house , making jackie incredibly jealous since her cello playing becomes a symbol of her current life : when she plays , she has the eyes of the world , but when she stops , she's alone . 

she enters into a shallow relationship with an equally famous pianist , daniel barenboim ( james frain ) , in hopes that she may overcloud her sister , but she eventually begins to lose it , and runs away to hilary's country home , where she hopes to gain admittance by hilary to sleep with her husband , since no one she sleeps with gives her any pleasure . 

it's all terribly melodramtic , as you can see , and by the time jackie has contracted ms ( in a brilliantly edited scene that surpasses the breakdown scene in the semi-smiliar "" shine "" in technical and emotional devastation ) , it would have been the time that i could easily call the sign for melodramatic overload if it hadn't been handled in such a way . 

the key thing here is that it's not about her gradual death and slip into insanity but rather that it's about her tumultuous relationship with her sister , which , i might add , is perfectly realized . 

their relationship is the most down-to-earth complex entity of the year : they love eachother more than anyone else in the entire world , but they're also completely jealous of one another . 

when a young jackie surpasses her playing abilities , she tries in vain to make a comeback but can't , and almost seems to marry to get back at jackie for her success . 

when jackie lands on top and sees her sister marry a wonderful man , she is jealous of her lifestyle to the most extensive brinks that i've ever seen in a film ( only two sisters who truly love eachother would dare share the same man ) . 

and the whole time , their love for eachother is never doubted or even tested . 

another thing i really liked is emily watson's performance . 

i usually make it a note to never overpraise an actor for playing either a drunkard or a lunatic or someone with a mortal disease ( or any combination of the three ) . 

my reasoning for this is that it's a fucking easy job . 

the worst case for this very year may be thandie newton in "" beloved "" : sure , she's good , but what's so tough about playing a woman who stumbles around , slurs her words together , and acts like a three year old inside a 20-year old's body ? 

hell , i could play that if i had a pair of breasts . 

in that same exact movie , though , is a performance by kimberly elise where she has to be the rock that holds the family together as her mother slowly goes insane , her brothers run off never to be seen again , and her mother's lover is scared off . 

she has to actually deal with real emotions , something much harder than mere stumbling about . 

but the academy of arts and sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons . 

if you don't believe me , look at jack nicholson's performance in "" as good as it gets "" : great performance , but easy job . 

this isn't so for watson , though , because her insanity comes from real emotions , not just a plot point . 

and thanks to the opening sequence , where we see her and hilary as kids , we understand the motives behind all her actions , and by the time she actually contracts ms and begins to loose her sanity and her life , we've already understood that this is the last straw for a woman plagued with terrible neuroses . 

rachel griffiths , who would have otherwise been the understudy to watson's protagonist , actually matches watson step-for-step , because as watson grows insane , and demands unspeakable things from her , griffiths holds her own , and has to deal with what she is able to give her sister who needs emotional help from her . 

griffiths , an otherwise unknown actress ( and watson being famous from "" breaking the waves "" and "" the boxer "" ) , is absolutely brilliant , just as absolutely brilliant as watson is , and if the academy and all the other critics groups , who've already deemed watson's performance the best of the year , glance over hers because she's the one who doesn't get to go insane ( read : she gets the boring role ) , then the scream of hysteria you hear will be from me . 

after all , griffiths has the thankless job of keeping things real - the tom cruise role in "" rainman "" ( the one who should have gotten oscar consideration and not hoffman ) . 

she does , and if anyone deserves accolades from the academy this year , it's griffiths . 

together , the two actresses work extremely well , though , and both have to go through deep emotional hell , the likes of which haven't been seen this year . 

if it hadn't been for an otherwise not-totally-great final section that deals way too much with jackie and not enough with hilary ( when the two had gotten equal treatment for the entirety ) , i'd say this is one of the top ten best films of the year . 

it's so close to perfection , in its structure , its treatment of its subject , and its beautiful technical specifications ( cinematography nomination , without a shred of doubt in my mind , and maybe film editing ) , that it's nearly a shame that it's not the flawless gem that it should be . 

but , hey , as it is , i can hardly complain . 
"
"when it comes to the average teenage romantic comedy , i expect negative reviews from critics left and right . 

predictable , unoriginal , and forgettable will most likely be the three adjectives to haunt the down to you's and the drive me crazy's released by the dozens these last couple of years . 

what i really look for in this kind of movie is the entertainment value while i'm sitting in the theater . 

am i enjoying myself ? 

is this a comfortable break from my week of finals ? 

this is why i have given films like final destination or road trip high marks ; i had a party of a time wasting my money on something i won't remember next week . 

so last week i opened up the new york times - and , no surprise , boys and girls got a negative review . 

daily news ? 

negative . 

reelviews ? 

negative . 

epinions . com ? 

negative . 

this was nothing new . 

american pie , final destination , road trip didn't get such hot reviews and i loved those guilty pleasures . 

same goes for she's all that , a formulaic but enjoyable pygmalion adaptation that got unjustly pounded . 

since boys and girls reunites she's all that director robert iscove and actor freddie prinze jr . , i predicted d ? j ? vu al over again . 

but , still curious , i asked around my school and from the one or two people who had seen it , the reactions were far from positive . 

i had made up my mind ; i'll catch it on video or cable in a couple of years . 

but , soon after , following a series of unexpected events ( we couldn't get into shaft because it is rated r ) , i found myself watching boys and girls . 

whoops . 

boys and girls is about a "" nerdy , smart "" boy named ryan ( prinze jr . ) and a "" popular , flirt "" girl named jennifer ( claire forlani ) . 

briefly meeting as pre-teens and now attending the same college , the two bump into each other so many times that eventually they become best friends . 

but in the movies , a male and a female cannot be friends without having that nagging feeling of attraction for each other . 

with advice from their roommates ( amanda detmer , jason biggs ) , ryan and jennifer attempt to discover the true meaning of their relationship . 

the film definitely lives up to the dreaded three adjectives - and mindless entertainment is nowhere to be found . 

i could hardly sit through the 93 minute running time for several reasons . 

the dialogue is probably the worst i have ever seen in any movie , mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script and the ridiculous words these characters use is what hollywood thinks kids can relate to . 

it is almost offensive . 

an example of an insightful conversation : 

 "" you're dumb . 

dumb , dumb , dumb , dumb . "" 

 "" no . "" 

 ( followed by a mandy moore-esque tune background ) 

 ( well it's not as bad as wing commander i guess ) 

the supporting cast is also painfully useless . 

detmer and biggs stand in the way for anything interesting to happen with their own boring , pointless subplots . 

and although this is supposed to be from both perspectives of the human sex , prinze jr's ryan dominates the screen while forlani's jennifer simply acts as a dilemma for him to work with . 

we never learn anything about jennifer which is a shame too because forlani is the only actor to bring any life into her character . 

teenager or not : you'll hate this movie , i guarantee it . 

maybe i should rent she's all that again . 

is it really as good as i think it is ? 
"
"wolfgang petersen's latest , the perfect storm , is like a pineapple . 

it only tastes good after arduous peeling and digging - if you try to eat the fruit , spikes and all , it's going to hurt ? quite a bit . 

ok , maybe that was a confusing analogy , so here's my main complaint about the latest man battles nature flick : there isn't really much of a story to tell . 

basically , a massachusetts fishing crew goes out to sea on a small boat , called the andrea gail , and gets stuck in the middle of "" the storm of the century . "" 

how much time does it take for petersen to tell this story ? 

not nearly enough . 

so he spends the majority of the film developing pointless side stories which all eventually become superfluous . 

audiences want to see the storm , they want to see a fight for survival but what they get is a lot of cliched , maudlin drivel . 

the last quarter of the perfect storm is utterly perfect in every aspect , but just try lasting the first three-quarters . 

i have yet to read sebastian junger's the perfect storm , but from what i have heard it is an unforgettable tale . 

based on a true story , the book must have found some other way to introduce the characters because in the movie version , the approach is weak . 

using a wonderfully patriotic score by james horner , petersen almost hides the in-your-face banality . 

right away the central characters are introduced : the gritty , determined captain ( george clooney ) , the ingenue ( mark wahlberg ) torn between his job and his girlfriend ( diane lane ) , the loving father ( john c . reilly ) , the comic relief who's always trying to get laid ( john hawkes ) , the new guy ( william fichtner ) who immediately antagonizes a crewmate and the quiet , french guy ( allen payne ) . 

so many problems strike the opening segment of the film that the remaining portions directly suffer . 

it is not the all-star cast's fault , just the characters designed for their portrayal . 

allen payne's character never speaks in the entire movie , not because he is mute , but because he's never given any lines ! 

are we supposed to root for a guy whose face and voice we are never given a chance to interact with ? 

fichtner's character is terribly underdeveloped - we don't know what he's doing there , where he's from , or who he's supposed to be . 

the remaining four fishermen are all cardboard stereotypes ( hawkes says to a female stranger in one scene "" you know what would look good on you ? 

me ! "" 

ooooh real creative ) . 

as the script advances and the andrea gail floats farther out into the waters , the crew continues to not feel human . 

only when the storm takes center stage does the movie jump out of its sleepwalk . 

the computer-generated images of gigantic waves crashing against a helpless boat are thunderously real . 

i can only imagine if this was an imax film , this city kid would surely never go in the water again . 

this is loud , jolting entertainment - adjectives that completely negate the rest of the film . 

the perfect storm was unfortunately a disappointment . 

the maelstrom lived up to its potential but everything else failed to do so . 

i guess i'll stick to that other survival spectacle ? you know the one on cbs ? 
"
"tibet has entered the american consciousness slowly during the past few years and burst into the forefront recently . 

the dalai lama has made speaking tours , tibetan designs and artifacts are showing up in shops , the plight of the people has captured the imagination of major actors and artists and now there are two big budget films within as many months . 

 "" kundun "" ( "" presence "" , a name the monks call the young dalai lama ) opens in 1937 with the search for the 14th incarnation of the tibetan leader . 

a group of monks enters a village and a two-year-old child catches their attention . 

the young boy proves himself by identifying possessions of the previous holy man as "" mine "" . 

he and his family are then moved to a monastery in lhassa where he is to be prepared to take his position as the religious and political leader of the country . 

he is forced into difficult decisions when china invades the country in 1950 . 

the peaceful and isolated country is ill-equipped to fight off the intruders and diplomatic attempts over the next years yield no results . 

eventually he must make the painful choice to flee to neighboring india . 

comparisons to "" seven years in tibet "" are inevitable . 

both films cover much of the same ground although the earlier movie does so from a westerner's point of view and features boxoffice draw brad pitt . 

 "" kundun "" features only native actors and is more of an insider's story . 

in some ways , this makes this film a superior concept , but it lacks the movement and spark that made "" seven years "" such an audience-pleaser . 

the actors contribute to the realistic feel of the movie ( filmed in morocco for obvious reasons ) . 

the only disappointment is chairman mao who looks like a wax dummy and moves as if he were a computer-generated character . 

on an intellectual level , it is interesting to see how two different approaches handle the same facts . 

some events are depicted differently and pitt's austrian mountain-climber who was portrayed as a pivotal influence in the dalai lama's life isn't even mentioned here . 

glossed over in "" seven years "" , the problems with the tibetan political system is hinted at here as the dalai lama muses "" we were just about to change things "" after the chinese attack . 

the film is magnificently beautiful thanks primarily to the cinematography of roger deakins . 

his lingering camera shows the exotic tibetan culture with luscious detail . 

especially striking is an extreme moving close up of a sand mandala grain by grain . 

the visual treats more than make up for the movie's faults creating a poetic meditation for the audience . 

walking out of the theater you feel like you have awakened from a transcendental experience . 

martin scorsese , known for his dark tales of the underworld ( "" goodfellas "" , "" taxi driver "" , "" casino "" ) has shifted gears . 

something of a thematic follow-up to his "" the last temptation of christ "" , this is his slowest film yet . 

oddly enough for a director with a history of graphic violence presenting a history filled with atrocities by the chinese , most of these events take place off-screen . 

his decision to not over-explain rituals is commendable . 

the stumbling oracle who spits out his prophecies while in a trance state is much more effective as a mystery than if we were spoon-fed interpretations . 

philip glass's score is impressive although at times it is too overwhelming and distracting . 

i talked to a tibetan i met outside the theater who had just seen the film and was walking back in to see it again . 

hearing his description of how he escaped from tibet at the age of seven and how his father was one of the soldiers accompanying the dalai lama during his trip to india , i was struck by what was missing in the movie . 

as grand as it looks and as historically accurate as it is , there is a distance between the audience and the movie . 

the film is more concerned with visuals and history and less so with human beings . 

with the exception of a few scenes , involvement with the characters is slight . 

one of those exceptions is the portrayal of the young dalai lama , shown as a mischievous boy who can't resist being a kid sometimes . 

an encounter with his older brother thubten j . norbu ( a retired indiana university professor ) who tells the young leader the chinese have ordered him to persuade him to accept communist rule or kill him is an outstanding moment , but there aren't many of these . 

even with its problems , the "" kundun "" experience is phenomenal , but one that i fear most will miss . 

many people who saw "" seven years in tibet "" will have a "" been there , done that "" attitude . 

it's likely that the film will miss a wide-spread appeal and public response will be the sound of one hand clapping . 
"
"i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard . 

the problem is , i can't remember them as i write this review . 

that's not a good sign . 

in booty call , jamie foxx is bunz , a character whom i can't really describe , because i don't know that much about him . 

i only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk , and that he doesn't like relationships , just "" booty calls "" at three in the morning ( no questions , no commitment ) . 

bunz has a best friend named rushon ( tommy davidson ) , who seems to be bunz's direct opposite : on the straight and narrow , and currently in a long-term commitment ( a whole seven weeks , wow ! ) . 

rushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend , nikki ( tamala jones ) , but for a reason which is not totally explained , it's going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikki's friend lysterine ( vivica a . fox ) , who have never met . 

to make a long story short , the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikki's obsession with safe sex . 

first she wants condoms , so bunz and rushon go out and get them . 

oh , no , they have to be latex , not lambskin . 

back to the store . 

now they've got to get dental dams , or there'll be no foreplay . 

why are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand ? 

nikki phones lysterine , who lives across the hall , and tells her she'd better be making these demands , too . 

talk about coitus interruptus . 

booty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those over-the-top comedies . 

the difference between the two is that in the latter , things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality . 

in this category , for example , you have ace ventura : private eye on the mild side , and airplane ! 

at the extreme . 

there are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status , but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention . 

it is disappointing , and even worse , distracting . 

there are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker ( are those real names ? ) 

does not live up to its potential , as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing . 

for instance , there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant . 

bunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese , much to everyone's surprise . 

however , when asked how he learned the language , he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from late-night kung-fu films , and soon gained mastery . 

this negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene . 

if , on the other hand , when asked how he learned to speak chinese , bunz simply replied with , "" kung-fu movies , "" and then moved on , the joke would have been much more effective . 

this is because it would have been totally unbelievable , but funny because we know it is unbelievable . 

by explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible , the film is not giving its viewers enough credit . 

the inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions . 

why are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends ? 

why do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine ? 

if nikki is so obsessed with safe sex , why doesn't she have some condoms at her own apartment ? 

these questions are not answered by the screenplay , but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward . 

a very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language . 

some movies use a lot of swear words , but use them under very justifiable circumstances , as when they are employed consistent with a character's pattern of speech . 

other films , such as the recent jackie brown , use them in ways that almost parody themselves . 

booty call just sticks them in to get laughs , and it doesn't work . 

they stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them . 

half of the scenes seem to occur for no reason . 

the chinese restaurant , a holdup at a convenience store , and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story , and are in there for filler . 

this is surprising , considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long . 

it's too bad that the core of the film isn't much better , since it is comprised of sometimes funny , but forgettable dialog . 

i refer you to the first paragraph of this review . 
"
"the first image in "" final fantasy : the spirits within "" is a computer-animated close-up of a human eye . 

it's a beautiful piece of work , remarkably detailed and quite convincing . 

when the picture pulls back to reveal the owner of the eye , however , things change . 

the young woman has mesmerizing hair , although it hangs too artfully ? even by movie standards ? to be believed . 

the facial features are more detailed than any computer-animation seen to date , but the result is more reminiscent of a very well-crafted doll than anything human . 

she is pretty , but bland , and not nearly expressive enough to come off like a person . 

all the characters in "" final fantasy "" are like that . 

of the core group , the younger white men and women are all athletic , attractive and indistinct , like applicants for a tv reality show . 

the black man is taller and burlier , and the aging scholar is bald , with wrinkles and a beard . 

none of them appear to be based on individuals ; they all look like the products of general descriptions given a police sketch artist . 

it gets worse when they talk and move . 

why is the sarcastic voice of steve buscemi , he of the great twisted face and snaggleteeth , coming out of the mouth of some dreary ken doll ? 

why , for every fluid physical gesture , do we also see herky-jerky puppet-style motions ? 

more to the point , who decided a full-length computer animated movie featuring "" hyperreal "" ( their term , not mine ) humanoids was a good idea ? 

 "" final fantasy "" is based on a phenomenally popular video game i've never played , with a story straight out of japanese anime , which more often than not leaves me bored and depressed . 

if you're a fan of either , please spare me your letters , as i will focus solely on the finished film and not its source materials . 

with an expression-challenged cast , "" final fantasy "" mixes turgid action scenes with heaps of mystical shit . 

the result is ugly , confusing and boring . 

note : the following reveals the basic plot . 

if you want to have a fighting chance of making any sense of the movie , i suggest you read it . 

earth is at war with aliens that appear to feed on human souls . 

most of our planet is devastated , with humans living in a few protected cities . 

while the bulk of the survivors focus on military strategies , aki ross ( voiced by ming-na ) and her mentor , dr . sid ( donald sutherland ) , believe in a more organic approach . 

they operate on the notion ( quoting straight from the press kit ) "" that all life forms have signature spirit waves that can be identified and contained . 

aki and dr . sid collect a series of organic specimens whose spirit signatures combined will form a wave of equal and opposite intensity to the spirit wave of the alien force . 

the waves will , in effect , cancel each other out and disarm the foreign contagion . 

they have collected six of the eight key spirits needed to complete their wave . 

they are on a desperate hunt to find the remaining two spirits before their time runs out . "" 

are you still with me ? 

there's only a little more . 

aki is infected with the alien force . 

dr . sid has developed a method of confining the contagion and keeping it from killing her , but the defense wall won't hold much longer . 

already , the alien is communicating with aki through her dreams . 

aiding aki and dr . sid are the deep eyes , a group of hard-as-nails types that would have felt at home with the troops in "" aliens . "" 

capt . gray edwards ( alec baldwin ) heads the task force that consists of a wise guy ( buscemi ) , a tough woman ( peri gilpin ) and a gentle giant ( ving rhames ) . 

throwing a monkey wrench into the plans is the requisite dumb ass : in this case general hein ( james woods ) , who wants to use the zeus cannon to bomb the aliens back to the stone age , even if it destroys earth as well . 

so there you have it . 

like most of the anime i've seen , the plot combines apocalyptic settings , lots of shooting and fuzzy spirituality , all wrapped up in a save-the-earth bow . 

but i'm bored with apocalyptic settings . 

i understand why so many live-action films employ them ? they're cheap ? but animated films can show anything , so why wallow in an industrial trash heap ? 

the action scenes and shoot-em-ups don't satisfy either . 

the humans move oddly and their facial features are so muted that the talented voice cast can't bring them to life ( in fact , their efforts merely emphasize what we're missing ) . 

aki is especially disappointing ; with her lack of expression and flat delivery , she looks and sound like a brunet version of weena , the eloi girl from 1960's "" the time machine . "" 

drab color choices and aliens that appear to have been created in jell-o molds sap the pizzazz from the big set pieces . 

students of computer animation may be fascinated with the technology behind "" final fantasy : the spirits within , "" but i found it sub-par across the board . 

 "" futurama "" does more effective battle visuals , the kids in "" south park "" are far more expressive than these mannequins and any old episode of the contemporary version of "" the outer limits "" does better doom and gloom sci-fi . 

so who needs this ? 

not me . 
"
"in the year 2029 , captain leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , "" boogie nights "" ) is training 'his' chimp pericles to pilot a pod from the usaf oberon space station . 

when an electromagnetic storm is encountered and pericles' pod is lost , davidson sets out unauthorized and lands thousands of years in the future on the "" planet of the apes . "" 

maybe if 20th century fox had set the proverbial 100 chimps in front of typewriters they would have gotten a better results than this adaptation of the pierre boulle novel by william broyles jr . ( "" cast away "" ) , and lawrence konner & mark d . rosenthal ( "" mighty joe young "" ) . 

director tim burton's unique look and style are nowhere to be found in this silly , pointless remake . 

davidson no sooner lands than he finds himself being swarmed by savages running in terror , whom he wisely joins . 

however , he's rounded up with the lot of them by the apes which rule this plant and handed over to slave trader limbo ( paul giamatti , "" duets "" ) . 

ari ( helena bonham carter , "" fight club "" ) , daughter of the illustrious senator sandar ( david warner , "" titanic "" ) and simian bleeding heart , believes humans should live with apes on equal standing , an unpopular notion . 

she takes a liking to leo , who she deems 'unusual . ' 

general thade ( tim roth , "" lucky numbers "" ) is of the opposite opinion , wishing for declaration of martial law that will allow him to annihilate the race . 

he's sweet on ari . 

it's relatively easy to see where this 'new' story is going from the onset , yet its ultimate revelation has gaping logic holes . 

the much ballyhooed 'surprise' ending is a nonsensical let down . 

an attempt at a love triangle , conveyed by ari and the human daena ( estella warren , "" driven "" ) giving each other 'back off' looks over leo , fails because he never develops a relationship with either of them . 

the lone sex scene is some hilarious foreplay between elder orangutan senator nado ( glenn shadix ) and his trophy wife nova ( burton's squeeze , lisa marie ) . 

guffaws will also likely greet charlton heston's cameo as thade's father , the one ape harboring a firearm ( ! ) who sputters some very familiar lines before dying . 

the only real success of the 2001 "" planet of the apes "" is rick baker's makeup , and even that's an iffy affair . 

no attempt was made to change the human whiteness of the actors' eyes , a real distraction amidst some otherwise impressive work . 

roth , warner and michael clarke duncan ( as thade's right hand man attar ) are given the most impressive makeovers . 

giamatti looks more like a skull than an ape and the female apes are too humanized to be given sexual appeal . 

tim roth delivers the most impressive acting job by getting the body language right - his nasty chimpanzee character leaps about , most spectacularly when mounting his steed , but even's he's undone by some obvious wire work . 

bonham carter delivers a goodly range of emotion from behind a stiff prosthetic , but is undone in turn by the silliness of the writing . 

most of the film has a set bound look which no amount of mist can cover . 

the ape's city resembles a dank complex of tree houses . 

the apes' military costumes ( colleen atwood , "" sleepy hollow "" ) as well as their field tents are reminiscent of eiko ishioka's work on coppola's "" dracula . "" 

that oriental flavor is also found in danny elfman's tribal , percussive score . 

 "" planet of the apes "" was the last blockbuster hope for the summer of 2001 , a dismal movie season that's going to the dogs . 
"
"us critic-type people are always shaking our heads and telling everyone that movies aren't thrill rides , but i think that "" back to the future ii "" is one of the few exceptions . 

if the original film had the spirit of the 1950s , then this has the spirit of the 80s : full of fights ; chase scenes ; cliff hangers ; special effects ; some detective work ; and of course the vision of the high-tech future . 

the film picks up exactly where the first film left off , with doc ( lloyd ) , marty ( fox ) , and jennifer ( elizabeth shue ) travelling 30 years into the future , because something bad is going to happen to marty and jennifer's kids . 

doc tells marty he must take his son's place at an incident that will cause a chain reaction if marty mcfly jr . says yes to griff ( wilson - in one of four different roles ) . 

whoever said history tends to repeat itself wasn't joking , especially when it comes to the movies . 

essentially the same chase scene that marty endured in the 50s takes place again in the year 2015 , but it's not as authentically exciting this time because it is so obviously a parody of itself . 

at the end of the situation marty has changed the course of history for the better , and it seems like everything's copasetic right ? 

wrong . 

since when do things go according to plan in the "" back to the future "" movies ? 

there are so many minor conflicts and details that effect the plot and the direction of the story i won't even bother to list them all . 

basically we get to see marty as an old man , his house , his family , etc . we also go back to an alternate 1985 , and then back again to 1955 , with everything happening so fast the film never stops to catch a breath . 

the films' best aspect is the fact that it actually goes back to the first movie and shows a lot of the action that occurred from another angle . 

it's difficult to convey the sense of wild and zany fun without describing every little detail . 

the only thing sacrificed in this film is the suspense . 

instead of a grand finale , we get lots of little victories . 

by the end everything is back to normal , but something happens that leads to yet another sequel , but it doesn't seem gratuitous . 

 "" back to the future part ii "" is a really great adventure movie . 

it certainly has more originality than other films but it lacks a certain charm that was dominate throughout its predecessor . 
"
"susan granger's review of "" songcatcher "" in the midst of this summer's fare of dinos revisited and romantic fiascoes , there are a few thoughtful movies - and this appalachian period drama is one . 

oscar nominee janet mcteer ( "" tumbleweeds "" ) stars as dr . lily penleric , an accomplished musicologist who , back in that pre-feminist era , was refused a full professorship at her university . 

determined to prove her worth , she ventures deep into the rugged mountains of north carolina , where her younger sister elna ( jane adams ) runs a school . 

there in bear creek , she discovers a treasure-trove of traditional scots-irish and english folk ballads , given a unique interpretation by the insular locals . 

excited , she sends for recording equipment and persuades vinie butler ( pat carroll ) and other self-sustaining mountain folk to share their musical heritage on her edison phonograph cylinders . 

their music , as she puts it , is "" as much a part of life here as the air you breathe . "" 

that's the main thrust of writer-director maggie greenwald's occasionally uneven culture-clash story , which is loosely based on olive dame campbell's foray through the blue ridge mountains in 1908 , but there's also some melodramatic romantic spice . 

ornery , bearded , banjo-picking aidan quinn falls for the statuesque , passionate "" songcatcher , "" while elna secretly engages in a lesbian relationship with a colleague ( e . 

katherine kerr ) . 

i'm ready to buy the soulful soundtrack with vocalists like emmylou harris , iris dement , taj mahal and young opera star emmy rossum who plays a pivotal role as mcteer's wide-eyed prot ? g ? . 

rated pg-13 , there's an intense scene of primitive childbirth . 

on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" songcatcher "" is an intelligent , extraordinary 8 , transported by the transcendent power of song .

"this movie is written by the man who is deemed to be "" one of the hottest writers in hollywood "" . 

he wrote the groundbreaking screenplay for scream ( 8/10 ) , then added the successful i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5/10 ) 

script to his mix , and also created the popular tv series "" dawson's creek "" . 

so when he asked to direct his first movie , based on his first ever script written , everyone and their grandma said "" sure , go for it ! "" . 

uhhm , my question is . . . did anyone bother reading this stupid script ? ? ? 

plot : ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught with some cheating papers by the bitchiest teacher in the west , mrs . tingle , and set to lose her scholarship to college . 

when she and her friends visit the teacher at home in order to explain their side of the story , they end up tying her up , and slowly trying to talk some sense into the hardheaded woman . 

critique : it's not so much that this is a bad movie , than the fact that it sucks . 

this movie is chock-full of one-dimensional characters , contains no actual humor that i was able to zone in on , zero tension or thrills , plot holes the size of my big ass , lame pop tunes played to mask nothing going on in the movie , and molly ringwald , vivica a . fox and lesley anne warren tossed away in throwaway roles . 

i was primed for this film as its interesting premise had me thinking misery ( 8/10 ) and 9 to 5 , but unfortunately for williamson , he went nowhere with the bright foundation , making references to the exorcist and dr . 

zhivago , which i doubt many in his target market will appreciate . 

he also forgot about suspense , with all of his characters based on incomprehensible decisions , unbelievable motivations and simply boring us with all of their trite dialogue . 

sure , katie holmes is cute , and her co-star , marisa coughlan , did a reasonably amusing impression of the exorcist ( worth two points out of my three on ten ) , but how can we forgive the biggest one-dimensional character in any film , holmes' rival in the film , mrs . tingle's complete unprofessionalism being let go by all others around her ( are teachers allowed to behave that way nowadays ? ) and a transparent romance between holmes and some long-haired dude , hired to be the poor man's version of skeet ulrich ( who himself is a poor man's version of johnny depp ! ) . 

all in all , this movie was laughable for me , provided me with no insight into anything , demonstrated williamson's genuine lack of directorial skills alongside a juvenile script , and provided helen mirren with a great role to chew into , unfortunately forgetting to give her character any believability , humanity or capacity to comprehend . 

no hip lines , no cheap thrills , just a dull time at the movie theater . 

if you want to see a funny teenage movie , go see detroit rock city ( 8/10 ) , and thank my drunken , sorry ass in the morning . 

little known facts about this film and its stars : kevin williamson's father was a fisherman . 

kevin used his knowledge of fishing hooks and winches when creating the killer in i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5/10 ) . 

he is also a huge fan of steven spielberg and coincidentally , so is dawson leery on tv's "" dawson's creek "" , a show kevin created . 

he was once an aspiring actor . 

in fact , he even landed a bit part on tv's "" another world "" . 

also , williamson has gone on record to say that an unsupportive english teacher who once told him that he would never amount to anything was the inspiration for mrs . tingle , which is also loosely based on the book "" killing mr . griffin "" by the writer of i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5/10 ) , 

lois duncan . 

he has also come out and said that he is a gay man . 

helen mirren was born in london , england under the name ilynea lydia mironoff . 

she is married to director taylor hackford , whose works include devil's advocate ( 8/10 ) and an officer and a gentleman ( 8 . 5/10 ) . 

this film was originally titled killing mrs . 

tingle , but was changed after the columbine high school shooting incident . 

actress marisa coughlan will star in kevin williamson next tv project called "" wasteland "" . 

this is actor barry watson first full feature film . 

he has played the character of "" seth "" on tv's "" malibu shores "" several times .

"'contact' shows why jodie foster is one of our best actresses . 

see contact with your family . 

it is a movie for all ages . 

--a review by stuart cracraft 

contact starring : jodie foster , matthew mcconaughey , john hurt director : robert zemeckis star 

after a predictable mit phillip morrison powers-of-10 zoom-out start ( which can be surprising to those not familiar with prof . morrison's work ) , contact picks up steam , gradually , building , by-the-end , an irresistable juggernaut and a very good movie that does not as is so often the case fall out-of-balance in terms of too much pandering to the technological "" geek "" side . 

by the end , the audience is left with what good science fiction is supposed to do : evoke a sense of wonder about the universe and evoke questions in your mind about what's out there . 

this movie does not let technology overshadow characterization and in this sense it is unusual amongst high-tech movies . 

however , except for jodie foster ( elie arroway ) and john hurt ( s . r . 

hadden ) , who are both actors of exceptional caliber , the supporting cast are not especially impressive . 

hurt certainly has had better roles ( stephen ward in scandal ) . 

this one , as the multi-billionare hadden , does not do his acting skills justice . 

this is clearly a foster movie by one of the great hollywood lights of our generation . 

foster's radiance has never been more strong than in the scene where she finally meets the vegans on their terms . 

early scenes take a long , long time to build up to this . 

the movie's pacing is very good and subtle . 

the panoramas of the radio dishes at arecibo and ceti in new mexico and puerto rico are beautiful . 

the politics of foster's character attempting to obtain funding for research at these places are trite and predictable however . 

one of the most entertaining , but very short scenes , is when foster is confronted by rob lowe , during a cabinet-level presidential meeting to discuss the alien invitation . 

there were real sparks in this scene between foster and lowe and it would behoove them to consider other vehicles in which this dynamism could be explored . 

it is the only scene in the movie in which there were tremendous dynamics between two characters . 

everything else was very one-sided ( e . g . 

foster ) . 

lowe can stand up to foster and it showed in that scene at the cabinet table . 

the core scene of the movie is set on a surrealistic beach on a far-away world in the starsystem of vega . 

it feels a lot like science fiction writer john varley's scenes in his book steel beach , where the female protagonists encounters an immensely superior intelligence , in one case a computer manufactured by mankind itself , and in foster's case , an illusion drawn from her memory . 

in another sense , this immensely moving scene evokes gene roddenberry's star trek pilot the cage , later the menagerie , when jeffrey hunter and susan oliver have their memories manipulated to create new worlds in which they live and encounter aliens . 

the concept is not new , by any sense , in the world of science fiction . 

but the beach scene , which is the centerpiece of the film , as is the whole film , is driven by foster . 

freed from her needs to direct by director zemecki , foster is able to let it all hang out in the characterization and the lead she provides to her supporting cast . 

as the movie gains speed , foster's acting intensifies and the audience really does experience it with her . 

it is certainly oscar-caliber acting , unquestionably . 

the supporting cast does well and zemeckis throws in some humor with some president clinton cameos , cleverly manipulated , george stephanopolus-style , to seem very forrest gump . 

in fact , zemeckis et . 

al . 

got in trouble for the usage of some of the footage seen in the movie , vis a vis clinton . 

but the audience i attended this movie with just had some good chuckles at clinton's walk-ons . 

the much-discussed tension between science and religion in this movie is not particularly insightful to those who have already gone through this course though it is helpful to those in the audience who have not . 

also , the near-final scene , in a senate judiciary hearing room is disappointing . 

contact is a fitting memorial to the memory of carl sagan , science popularizer , and sometime pedantic gadfly of the halls of academe . 

perhaps now , sagan can be said to be with his dragons of eden .

"wesley snipes is a master of selecting bad action roles . 

murder at 1600 , u . s . marshals , money train , drop zone , boiling point , and the ultimate camp film - passenger 57 . 

the art of war is another entry in this very ugly and unique category . 

ultimately , it is little more than a ridiculous action film with a plot as believable as the warren report , ugly violence that would have made peckinpah cringe , and terrible acting by b-list actors like michael biehn and anne archer . 

oddly , it feels like the undiscovered sequel to another snipes "" masterpiece , "" rising sun . 

the movie revolves around the convenient story of a special un operative caught up in a secret murder conspiracy involving a chinese ambassador , the chinese triad brotherhood , a rich chinese businessman ( played by ? that bad guy from rising sun , cary-hiroyuki tagawa ) a chinese un interpreter , and , inexplicably , donald sutherland . 

the film ends with more confusion than a boatload of chinese immigrants trying to register at ellis island . 

or should i say the film ends with the most blatant ripoff of both the matrix and all of john woo's hong kong films combined . 

i am really at a loss to figure out why wesley snipes had the gumption to not only star in this action dud but also act as one of the producers of the film . 

i usually enjoy snipes' movies - though his dramatic roles better show off his creativity as an actor than the flashiness of his action films . 

simply , i am amazed by the how inane the script was , filled with terrible cliches and extremely violent action sequences . 

director christian duguay ( screamers ) has a strange attraction to the viciousness of violent acts -- showing splattering brains , people impaled with broken shards of glass , and lots of gargling and gagging as blood sprays everywhere . 

it also sickens me to know that oliver stone , one of the greatest directors working today , had his hand in producing this monstrosity . 

i guess snipes sold stone on the conspiracy angle and stone chose not to read the script , watch the dailies , be involved in casting , or anything else -- or else he'd be filing a court order to remove his name from the credits . 

it's also seems evident that with the russkies as our new bosom buddies and the middle eastern terrorist angle being beaten to death in the last couple of years that the new international enemies in hollywood are the communist chinese . 

i'm sure over the next couple of months , even more "" chinese conspiracy/martial-arts action flicks "" are going to be popping up in your local multiplex . 

hopefully they won't include wesley snipes .

"when i first saw the previews for ron howard's latest film , my expectations were discouragingly low . 

a show about nothing ? 

sounds like "" seinfeld . "" 

a guy whose entire life is broadcast 24 hours a day ? 

sounds like "" the truman show . "" 

what is it with hollywood that no sooner than one production company puts out an animated feature about ants , another puts one out about bugs ? 

which is why i was pleasantly surprised by "" edtv , "" which turns out to be a fresh , insightful , and often times hilarious film about the follies of instant celebrity . 

the writing , by howard's longtime collaborators lowell ganz and babaloo mandel , is right on the money and howard himself should be credited for giving the subject matter a fresh focus . 

in the hands of a less-experienced director , "" edtv "" could easily have had all the flavor of yesterday's meatloaf . 

with their 'true tv' cable ratings being threatened by 'the gardening channel' ( apparently people would rather watch soil ) , the northwest broadcasting company is looking for a novel concept to attract viewers . 

program director cynthia topping ( ellen degeneres ) comes up with the idea of putting a nobody on the air and broadcasting his every waking and sleeping moment . 

the hook is to find a regular guy , someone normal that people can relate to . 

while scouting possible candidates , cynthia's camera crew discover ed pekurny and his pig brother ray ( woody harrelson ) in a bar , where ray believes he has what it takes for his fifteen plus minutes of fame . 

but on watching the videotape , the show's producers are more taken with ed than with ray . 

he's cute , he says all the wrong things , and he's 100% usda hick . 

cynthia's boss , played by rob reiner , gives the show a week to deliver the goods and it's tough going in the early stages . 

the most exciting thing that happens is ed brushes his teeth . 

 "" action shot ! "" 

wags one of the production assistants when a couple of pop tarts jump out of the toaster . 

you get the idea . 

but soon enough , things--nielsen-boosting kinds of things--start to happen to this unassuming san francisco video store clerk and the 'true tv' cameras are right there to document it . 

ed's privacy is no longer his own , his newfound fame starts having a negative impact on his family life , and what little dignity he has left is trampled on by the media . 

who should ed go out with ? 

you can be sure the pollsters have a list . 

not only is the film exceedingly well cast , but its performers are consistently excellent . 

matthew mcconaughey provides the face , the body language , and the lovable texan accent to fill the shoes of america's latest phenomenon . 

he and harrelson look like they really could be brothers . 

sally kirkland is noteworthy in a difficult role as ed's mother , and martin landau is one of the film's highlights as al , ed's ailing stepfather . 

jenna elfman ( from tv's "" dharma and greg "" ) proves herself surprisingly worthy in the company of kirkland and landau , although those alpine eyebrows of hers get a little distracting . 

even degeneres and reiner are better than you'd expect . 

in 1979 , writer/director/comedian albert brooks made a zany little film called "" real life "" in which a small-time opportunist makes a real-time documentary about a typical american family . 

the scenes of ed's family sitting around the dinner table feasting on kentucky fried chicken and waxing idiotic play like a big-budget variant on that film , paralleling its wickedly inventive humor . 

as with most films by albert brooks , "" real life "" was funny , but absurd . 

the funniest--and scariest--thing about "" edtv "" is that it is absolutely believable . 
"
"vampire's is a rude , chauvinistic movie where women are portrayed as pawns of abuse , present only to pleasure men , feed vampires , readied to be bashed or beaten - till one's sensibilities is shocked by the low iq and mentality of this regressive movie . 

to make matters worse , the buffoons that go hunting vampires are all rednecks , and deserve to have their heads bitten off , if not , their bodies carved in half . 

the dilemma of hating the ? heroes' as much as the ? villains' , makes one wish that the ? hand of god' would suddenly appear and blast both parties into oblivion . 

james wood portrays jack crow , a man obsessed with killing vampires , whose soul reason for living is based on revenge ( they killed his parents ) , but this is not a good excuse for being more obnoxious than the vampires . 

as for adam baldwin , he is nothing more than a stooge who is ordered to beat women when the director shouts ? action' , and the script should have been reworked to avoid much offence against the female sex . 

as for the claims that the catholic church created ? dracula' , well that is the second most sacrilegious suggestion , outside the fact that priests and monks bear the brunt of the vampire fury , with enough blood spilt to make the inquisition look tame . 

an awful movie on all counts , my suggestion is to bring back buffy and bury this group of incompetent , rude vampire slayers . 
"
"i must say from the outset that i have never been much of a kurt russell fan . 

i've seen some of his films ( silkwood , backdraft , unlawful entry ) and while he gave adequate performances , i have never been impressed with his work . 

breakdown , then , is something of a surprise . 

russell gives a fine performance , as do most of the cast , one that is not upstaged by the action orchestrated in the second half of the film . 

to say that he holds the film together would not be completely true , but he does it no harm . 

russell plays jeff , one half of a married couple travelling with his wife amy ( kathleen quinlan ) cross country to san diego to start a new job and a new life . 

while journeying through the desert their car breaks down and , left helpless and stranded , jeff waves down a passing truck driver ( j . t . 

walsh ) who offers to take them to a nearby diner to call for a tow truck . 

because of a nasty incident earlier with a couple of ruffians , jeff decides to stay with the car while amy gets help . 

that , it seems , is the last time jeff ( or anyone else ) sees her . 

breakdown has been compared to several movies : george sluizer's the vanishing ( the original , hopefully , not his appalling hollywood remake ) , steven spielberg's duel and any number of hitchcock films . 

as with these , breakdown does not , for the most part , stray down the conventional path of the american action-thriller . 

jeff does not become a gun-toting vigilante on the hunt for his wife , but instead becomes a scared , confused everyman who has no idea what the hell is going on . 

when we do find out what has happened to amy , it does come as a slight disappointment , if only because it's too early in the film ; i for one could have done with an extra twenty minutes or so of mystery and bewilderment , but this affects the film little . 

russell , as mentioned earlier , is very good in his role , and kathleen quinlan is nowhere near as annoying as she was in apollo 13 . 

j . t . 

walsh , as the possibly evil truck driver , is terrific ; he is one of the best of the fine batch of character actors hollywood doesn't seem to know what to do with , but director jonathan mostow is on the right track here . 

the reason he makes such a great villain is that he actually looks like a real person , one anyone would be able to trust , which makes the plot that much more believable . 

breakdown is what hollywood doesn't make enough of , a great thriller with believable characters and scenes that do , indeed , have viewers on the edge of their seats . 

one of the most genuinely exciting films i've seen in a long time .

"when i was nine , i started buying the coolest toy figures in my local department store . 

masters of the universe was the pinnacle of what i was after for action figures : they combined science fiction and fantasy , had cool names like mekanek and stinkor and each came with its own little comic book to read . 

of course , the animated series produced by filmation remains one of the most wildly successful television products in world history . 

given the tremendous success of the toys and the cartoon ( not to mention its moderately successful spin-off she-ra : princess of power ) , it was inevitable that a production company would put two and two together , come with the result of "" trillions "" and make a live-action masters movie . 

let's be blunt : masters of the universe is a very bad movie . 

the story is painfully dull and mind-numbingly cliched ( hands up who * wouldn't * guess he-man and skeletor take their fight into the real world ) and is acted out by either incredibly untalented actors ( dolph lundgren as he-man for one ) or good actors ( james tolkan , meg foster ) given such awful characters and dialogue that they can't help but seem terrible . 

it is extremely clear that someone making the movie wanted it to be as good as star wars . 

we have the alien bounty hunters , the desert skif technology , stormtrooper lookalikes and a musical score so reminiscent of john williams that "" deja vu "" is too polite a term to use in describing it . 

 "" blatant uninspired ripoff "" would appear more appropriate . 

tv fans might want to check out courtney cox ( monica in friends ) and robert duncan mcneill ( lt paris in star trek : voyager ) , very early in their careers and not doing to well in them either . 

so in the face of such mindless sub-mediocrity , is there anything to make masters of the universe worth watching at all ? 

yes , there is . 

one incredible good reason . 

his name is frank langella . 

langella has always been one of the underrated actors of hollywood , appearing in countless films over the years . 

here he plays skeletor , the villain of the piece . 

dressed in opulent black velvet robes and bearing a skull for a face , he is one part darth vader , one part emperor and two parts grim reaper . 

given this character , langella falls right into it with style and precision . 

skeletor is believable , interesting and manages to tread the fine line between being a homage to the past and startlingly original in his own right . 

masters of the universe . 

i remember loving it when i was eleven . 

at twenty one it's difficult to see why . 

but , as i said , it is blessed with a superlative villain who makes the entire thing worth the tedium of the remainder . 

besides , this year marks the film's 10th anniversary . 

watch it with some friends for a good laugh and celebrate .

"disaster films have a tendency to be very formulated and very cliched . 

to see a disaster film with actual originality , or at least a decent plot twist , would definitely be a welcome surprise . 

unfortunately , folks , it's not likely . 

dante's peak is cliched , and at times corny , but also pretty decent . 

to be honest , i wasn't very interested in seeing this film , and word of mouth , as well as several reviews , didn't make it sound promising . 

so i was pleasantly surprised that to find that this movie wasn't bad at all . 

it's pretty run of the mill , but it's not something i would say is merely "" ok "" to watch . 

in case you don't know , dante's peak is about a volcano and the city which lives in it's shadow , dante's peak ( who would've guessed , eh ? ) . 

pierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study the volcano and , perhaps more by hunch than actual scientific proof , is determined that the volcano will be arupting in the very near future . 

due to the lack of more substantial evidence , nobody warns the small town , and when they finally do , it's in the middle of the town meeting that the volcano finally blows . 

brosnan , all around good guy , will , of course , save the day . 

 . 

 . 

or at least the mayor of dante's peak ( linda hamilton ) . 

naturally the two will become infatuated with one another . 

 ( if you think i just ruined a plot development , you haven't seen very many movies ! ) 

there's also the virtually neccessary kids and pet dog to tug at your heart strings . 

and of course , the kids or the dog ( at least one or the other ) will do something heroic . 

 . 

 . 

but hey , i don't want to ruin all the surprises ! 

if there was a part of you that was hesitating seeing dante's peak merely because it was rumored to be a waste of time , i urge you to watch it and decide for yourself . 

it's not brain food , but it succeeds at what it's meant to be . 

 . 

 . 

an enjoyable , suspenseful movie about the fury mother nature can unleash !

"people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels , stories , comic books or movies . 

often science fiction aficionados find material , previously labelled as science fiction , to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror , or rather simple techno-thriller . 

in such cases , mistakes are understandable - genre boundaries are never clearly marked . 

but , i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic . 

such thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago , when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff , 1983 film directed by philip kaufman . 

the mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits . 

but the right stuff film isn't even fiction . 

it was based on the non-fiction book by tom wolfe , covering the early years of american space program . 

the plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base , major test site for experimental planes . 

the major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier . 

many pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado . 

but one quiet pilot , chuck eager ( played by sam shaped ) succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots , determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records . 

ten years later , soviets have launched "" sputnik "" marking the beginning of the space age . 

in order to regain national prestige , us government decides to be the first to send man into space . 

best air force , navy and marine pilots are recruited into program , but not yeager , because he lacks college education and desired all-american image . 

in one of critics' polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s . 

such high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman's film looks quite atypical for its time . 

with more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s - age when hollywood used to make films larger than life . 

but the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker . 

philip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original , memorable movies . 

the right stuff was the last of them , swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual , risk-taking "" artsy "" projects . 

the right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film . 

the plot is almost non-existent and not very coherent ; the story , featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes , shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots , embodied in yeager , to new generation of the astronauts . 

the film also lacks conventional protagonist - yeager ( who also appears in small cameo ) remains the true hero of the film , but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives , making this movie into ensemble piece . 

that gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents , until that specialised only for bit or character roles . 

sam shepard is great as yeager , war hero whose greatest achievement - breech of the sound barrier - remained obscured in history books , probably due to his own modesty . 

on the surface , he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues , but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases . 

shepard's performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean-cut marine ( and future politician ) john glenn . 

young dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper , and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom , superbly played by fred ward . 

always reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and ( arguably ) first american man in space alan shepard . 

kaufman left room for female talents to excel too - barbara hershey , pamela reed , veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots' wives . 

royal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher , but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice-president lyndon b . johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch . 

great acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman's superb direction . 

most notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time . 

the beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert , as virtual unknowns , far away from strict rules and discipline . 

everything seems natural -yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world . 

in that setting , it's quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights . 

but the times are changing ; ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war , and "" natural "" pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined , conventional pilots . 

their entire lives become focus of media frenzy , and their job is subjected to strict rules , meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats , publicity-seeking politicians and uncaring scientists ( like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun , played by scott beach ) only to preserve their most basic human dignity . 

this contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence - while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity , "" mercury "" astronauts receive fame and fortune , although some of them even before going in the space . 

those contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman's superb use of poetic movie language . 

editing is great , and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion ( the same image would be copied in many latter films ) . 

although kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military , which provided authentic locations and period equipment , he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights . 

those effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space . 

another fine contribution of this film is "" oscar "" -awarded musical score by bill conti ; i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it . 

it is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy . 

some of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period . 

this film is great , and its cult status is well deserved , but there are some minor flaws . 

some of the "" mercury "" astronauts aren't fleshed out enough ( although being played by fine actors , like lance henriksen ) . 

film also lacks proper closure . 

on the other hand , most logical conclusion of the film - landing on the moon - would require this film to be more than six hours long . 

also , some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians , who were portrayed as evil monsters , just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan's america . 

in some of contemporary interviews , kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible , and in order to do that , he portrayed russians not as they were in real life , but as they were perceived by americans in early 1960s . 

time has passed ; now we don't see astronauts as heroes . 

in this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions , those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers . 

few young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up . 

but this film , sentimental reminder of the times "" when future began "" , perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow "" mercury "" astronauts' footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky . 

and even if they decide to stay on earth , they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema .

"gun wielding arnold schwarzenegger has a change of heart by the film's end and becomes a believer in god instead of a skeptic , going through an amazing transformation by having a christian epiphany in the final scene as he becomes someone who can now beat the devil by his faith alone . . . this is after two hours of throwing people out windows and shooting more people than your average serial killer . 

nobody can save this bomb from it's own stupidity and arrogance in filmmaking and arrogance in believing that this is a positive religious-type of film . 

it's just a pile of dreck . . . an 

ill-conceived exploitive project , a pyrotechnical film . 

 "" end of days "" aims to be an apocalyptic thriller . 

it features an idiotic script , a hack director , and a one-dimensional star who is past his prime . . . which 

makes this film dumber than dumb , plus it's not funny , not campy , or is it in the least bit entertaining . 

it's just dreary and unwatchable . . . a 

big-budget slasher film . 

arnold plays an alcoholic security guard who finds his new mission in life is to stop satan ( occupying gabriel byrne's body and possessing a wall st . bank account ) from destroying the world . 

the film opens in vatican city , roma 1979 -- where the pope is alerted by a young visionary priest tomaso , looking out at the night sky and seeing a comet whiz by , who proclaims after looking at his scrolls -- that's the sign for the 'eye of god , ' which reveals that a child has been born who is being prepared to give birth to satan's baby ( the anti-christ ) in the hour before the new century begins , when satan will fuck her and open up the gates to hell on earth . 

tomaso has some twenty years to find this woman and save her and the world from doom . 

but some in the pope's circle want to kill her if found , even though the pope insists on having faith and letting her live , as he lectures them : "" even in the world's darkest days -- doing evil doesn't stop evil , but brings on more evil . "" 

we saw the girl being born in nyc in 1979 , which seems to be the 'logical' place to look for satan according to the astrology charts of the visionaries . 

the chosen woman is christine york ( robin ) . 

it is now a few days before the new year celebration for 2000 and arnold and his wise-cracking security guard partner kevin pollack are hired to guard a wall street turd , and when he is fired upon by a renograde priest , thomas aquinas , arnold saves him and through a ridiculous chase captures the tongue less priest who fired the shot . 

he , nevertheless , can speak and tells arnold an 'end of days' is coming as prophesized in revelations . 

but satan gets to him in his hospital room and nails him to the ceiling while scribbling latin warnings of 'the end of the world' on his body . 

it is now up to arnold to save the world and find the chosen woman . 

he quickly finds christine and does everything to protect her from all the evil forces around her , as the film includes ludicrous helicopter rescues , people jumping out of windows , satan taking a piss and dropping a match to kill arnold's partner as the piss explodes like gasoline , satan being fired at . . . resulting in his sometimes experiencing pain and sometimes nothing , as if the director forgot which way he wants to have it . 

there is nothing spared in nyc from fire bombs -- including the subway , churches , and luxury buildings . 

the only trouble with all these high-budget action sequences , was that it lacked purpose and even entertainment value . 

the story was so terrible and inaccurate , that it did not have an iota of value or credibility . 

mercifully the movie drags to a final confrontation in times square , trying unsuccessfully to build tension to the countdown toward the year 2000 . 

why is the end of 1999 considered to be the devil's number "" 666 , '' well ! 

 . . . 

satan's numeral is actually "" 999 , '' which is upside down of "" 666 . '' 

accordingly , you just put a "" 1'' in front of it-- and bingo -- you get "" 1999 . '' 

with logic like that , this film might even think it pulled the wool over the viewer's eyes and got away with such a febrile explanation of the occult . 

this film should become a classic used by film schools in how not to make a horror film . 

i highly recommend seeing it for that purpose . 
"
" "" first rule of fight club is , don't talk about fight club . "" 

this quote deals directly with my opinion of this film , because quite frankly , it's not even worth mentioning . 

director david fincher ( seven ) has completely gone over the edge . 

with crude humor , an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture , i'm surprised i didn't walk out . 

this just goes to show that hype kills . 

it's very rare that a film so hyped up as "" fight club "" turns out to be noteworthy , and this is no exception . 

the story goes like this . 

edward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions , until he meets marla ( helena bonham carter ) . 

norton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle , when he spots her at a session that he also attended . 

apparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like , literally living in pain . 

why any person would think of such a thing is beyond me , but things do get worse . 

norton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling , and it's on a plane that he meets tyler durden ( brad pitt ) . 

the two men develop a bond , and go out to a bar , and by golly after they get drunk , the two pitiful characters fight . 

how do they come up with this stuff ? 

anyway , their fighting catches other pathetic loser's attention , and a club is formed . 

out of all this mess , there manages to lie a message . 

fincher shows us that society is like robots . 

we work in our jobs doing things step by step , and want out . 

our insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are , and we blame it on others . 

call me crazy , but this is common knowledge . 

i think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is , which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably . 

even with two good actors , and a solid actress , they only manage to weaken the story . 

i couldn't help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp . 

it just shows how desperate the script is for attention . 

i guess brad pitt was right for this role , because i felt like beating him up myself . 

his bothersome and depressing character , made me disgusted at his 20 million fee . 

it only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more . 

helena bonham carter however really had no purpose . 

she just popped up on screen , mumbled some lines , smoked and left . 

this continues for what seems like 6 hours . 

the film drags on and my headache gets bigger , while "" fight club "" nears what i think might be the end . 

unfortunately by then , the film hits rock bottom . 

though the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes , it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace . 

on a side note , the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film , that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer . 

fincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson . 

concentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment , won't do any good if everything else is in need of support . 

also , i'm afraid that immature men might respond to the film's violence . 

the last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult . 

when the film ends , i'm just glad to get home and take some advil . 

you'll either enjoy what the film has to offer , or agree with ed norton when he says "" this is so f * * * ing stupid . "" 
"
"fantastically over hyped , godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen . 

the film opens with footage of nuclear testing on the french polynesian islands , then an attack on a boat from some beast , and finally we join dr . nick tatopoulos ( broderick looking about 17 years old ) doing some research in chernobyl . 

some shady u . s government guys appear , and ask him to come to an island where they have massive footprints , from what looks like a giant lizard . 

and what's more , this beast is heading for new york . 

gulp ! 

although godzilla should be a non stop roller coaster ride , and at some points it is , there is something curiously uninvolving and unexciting about this movie . 

the main faults lie with the acting and writing , common problems with 'summer blockbuster' movies . 

broderick is pretty useless as the hero , with no humour or a 'tough guy' image . 

while emmerich's previous summer flick , independence day ( 1996 ) had wisecracks and action from jeff goldblum and will smith , this has neither . 

also , maria pitillo , as broderick's former girlfriend , is just as useless , with a chronic disability in acting . 

she's incapable of showing emotion , speaks every line in the same way , and basically she's total crap . 

it's up to french actor jean reno to save the day , and indeed he does , turning in a campy performance as a french secret agent . 

shame he has such little screen time in such a overlong film . 

hank azaria also turns up as a crazy cameraman named 'animal' , and he adds a little life to the picture . 

also making an appearance is harry shearer ( probably best know for doing voices in the simpsons ) as a slimy news reporter . 

o . k , so the acting is not up to par , but it never is in these movies . 

but what about the script ? 

well , that's not up to par either . 

emmerich and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in the destruction of new york city that they forgot to write a script . 

the dialogue is banal ( broderick looks at a lot of fish and utters 'that's a lot of fish . ' ) , and the character development is non existent ( reno plays the typical frenchman ( 'no croissant ? ' ) , 

broderick forever remains a geeky scientist . ) 

also , the film is seriously lacking a sense of humour . 

the jokes that are uttered are pathetic , and there's an 'hilarious' running gag about siskel and ebert . 

 ( the mayor is mayor ebert , and is assistant is called gene ! 

ha ha ha ha ! . ) 

the plot is dire , and in the end just rips off jurassic park ( 1993 ) by having lots of baby godzilla's ( i . e . 

velicorapters ) running around new york . 

right , so the script and acting suck . 

but what about the special effects ? 

thankfully , they're are quite good . 

godzilla is an impressive piece of cgi , although we don't see much of him because the movie is so dark . 

the destruction of new york is pretty well done aswell . 

but although they are impressive , they can't save godzilla from being an hugely disappointing and boring movie . 

the movie goes on for far too long aswell , and it can't seem to decide on a ending . 

and of course , the ending itself leaves possibility for a sequel . 

let's just hope one never arrives . 
"
"everybody in this film's thinking of alicia . 

no , this is not a documentary on those of us after we first saw the "" cryin' "" video . 

this is one of those erotic thrillers , but not like one starring shannon whirry or shannon tweed . 

first off , there's zero sex , almost no nudity , and it's not as well-plotted as one of those tweed flicks . 

well , anyway . 

the "" plot . "" 

alicia plays , well , the babysitter , who is taking care of some kids one night while the parents ( j . t . 

walsh and lee garlington ) go out to a party . 

the film , trying to be like one of those introspective erotic thrillers , shows every characters' thoughts , except alicia's . 

the thing is alicia's in most of them in most cases , and the thoughts aren't too kosher . 

first off , there's her boyfriend ( jeremy london , who gave one of the all-time lousy performances in "" mallrats , "" and is only a notch better here ) , who's a dorky kid who hangs out with a kind of bully , played by nicky katt from "" suburbia "" ( who shows he's got that quiet creepiness down pat once again ) . 

they decide they want to crash her babysitting job , looking for the typical babysitting hanky-panky . 

somethine like that . 

the film intercuts between the subplots ( alicia babysitting , nicky and jeremy , the party ) and each characters' thoughts . 

we get to see jeremy and nicky's dreams of doing a little threeway with alicia , j . t . 

thinking of coming home to find alicia naked in the bathtub ( she has it all covered up , the little tease ) , and , worst of all , lee garlington dreaming of that hunk , george segal . 

it even shows them in bed together . 

yea . 

i so wanted to see george and lee garlington in bed , though i guess i'm used to george after seeing her and mary tyler moore fooling around in "" flirting with disaster . "" 

the ending is some kind of big tragedy thing , but come on . 

like we care about any of the characters . 

the only interesting one is alicia , mainly because she's alicia , and we mostly see her in the fantasies . 

so i guess she's some kind of mystery or something . 

but she is never explored further . 

so , basically , this film is just a series of mastabatory images , sometimes featuring a non-nude alicia ( once again , sadly ) , sometimes featuring a scantily-clad george segal ( once again , sadly ) . 

i watched this on one of those free previews of showtime or cinemax one night , and let me tell you , it is the only way to watch this film . 

i mean , there's a reason they put these kinds of films on late at night : they're just as good as sleeping pills . 

and this one is one big fat waste of time , even for an alicia film .

"for timing reasons having to do with baby sitters , we recently went to a multiplex and saw undercover blues . 

i would give it one half of a star for guts . 

anyone in a movie this bad would have to have guts . 

i later read a ny times review that said kathleen turner and dennis quaid had gotten so plump they looked like they had the mumps in the show . 

the script was the worst part . 

they had characters who talked with funny accents in an attempt to make you laugh . 

they had lots of "" great "" sight gags like two people trying to go in a door together and therefore bumping shoulders against the door . 

turner and quaid both kept smiling like some idiots on a game show . 

the good news is that we were smart enough to vote with our feet and left . 

buy some tickets and give them to your worst enemies . 

tell them the show is great and smile a lot . 

 * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . 

a must see film .

totally unbearable . 

review written on : september 29 , 1993

"
"i love movies . 

i really do . 

every time i watch great movies like goodfellas ( 1990 ) or raiders of the lost ark ( 1981 ) , a tear comes to my eye due to the awesome talent , skill and entertainment that is on display . 

even lower grade films such as the naked gun 33 1/3 ( 1994 ) or ghostbusters ii ( 1988 ) while not exactly brilliantly well made , are certainly not a waste of celluloid and present entertainment value . 

then there's my favourite martian , the exact opposite of what a movie should be : a hurried , poorly written and acted movie with one goal , to make money . 

disney , ever since the lion king ( 1994 ) have lost their magic touch , but this dross just shows how far disney have sunk . 

christopher lloyd plays a martian who crash lands in front of t . v reporter's tim o'hara car ( daniels ) , and soon tim finds the martian in his home , trying to recover and fix his spaceship . 

along with his 'zoot' spacesuit , voiced by wayne knight , must fix his spaceship before it explodes , and also try to stop his identity being revealed to the public , firstly by o'hara , but later by rival t . v presenter brace channing ( hurley ) , by calling himself tim's 'uncle martin . ' 

'laughter' is supposed to arise from the 'comical' events , but never does . 

many bad films have good intentions , but my favourite martian doesn't appear to try to provide any entertainment . 

filled to the brim with wham bang special effects , my favourite martian offers little more than some nice eye candy . 

christopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie , i've never seen a man pull a face for 93 minutes until now . 

jeff daniels plays 'staple nice guy' and his role is useless . 

his performance is incredibly lazy , although his paperthin character doesn't deserve more than the performance he gives . 

darryl hannah looks as pretty as ever , but her role is somewhat , erm , limited . 

hurley mistakes 'acting' for 'shouting and looking like a twit' and wins the david wilcock award for 'most irritating , godawful performance in a moving picture . ' 

way to go liz ! 

for the supporting cast , disney manage to assemble every character actor out there , during the film i was going 'he was the guy in . . . ah . . er . . . ' 

before finally giving up and switching off . 

another major setback is the staple 'comedy sidekick . ' 

unfortunately , the writers ( sherri stoner and deanna oliver , if anyone cares ) forget that a comedy sidekick needs to be 'funny . ' 

instead , they deliver zoot , the martians deeply unfunny sidekick . 

although meant to be a manic character no doubt , every line that comes out of his 'neck' is a dud . 

a real dud . 

citizen kane delivers more laughs a minute than his hell spawn piece of polyester . 

even the kids in the audience were insulted by this character : not one child even bothered to smirk . 

it's a nice special effect , though . 

another problems with this comedy are the gags themselves . 

or rather , the lack of them . 

my favourite martian reaches a new level of toilet humour : it goes past the bowl , down the pipe and into the sewer . 

now , toilet humour can be funny , as dumb and dumber ( 1994 ) humorously showed . 

but here , characters farting , belching and almost getting crapped on ( literally ) is not 'amusing . ' 

it's insulting . 

there's one good gag right before the credits , but it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died and his unfunny twin continued . 

either that , or they were hoping that easy to please six year olds wouldn't mind the fact that his movie is beaten by men at work in the funny stakes . 

yes , men at work . 

yowza ! 

the fact that a lot of money was pumped into this film , and that they actually got people to agree to be in this film just depresses me even more . 

there are thousands of brilliant films out there that can't get distribution , yet trash like this gets released nation-wide with ease . 

thankfully , as soon as it makes it's money , it will never be seen again , and my favourite martian will end up where the two lead characters do near the end of the movie : down the toilet . 
"
"almost a full decade before steven spielberg's saving private ryan asked whether a film could be both "" anti war "" and "" pro-soldier "" , john irvin's hamburger hill proved it could . 

lost in the inundation of critical acclaim that greeted oliver stone's platoon , this excellent film was dismissed as "" too militaristic "" . 

it's hard to understand exactly why---unless irvin , in assembling his motley collection of young men who for predictable ( and often naive ) reasons "" chose to show up "" for the vietnam debacle , ---has refused to present us with the stone killer , drug-stoked psycho and ruthless opportunist who have become to vietnam war epics what "" the polack , the hillbilly and the kid from brooklyn "" became to wwii movies . 

hamburger hill , based on a true story , is not an easy film to watch . 

there is a scene that will have graying anti-war activists squirming in their seats , or moved to genuine tears . 

and the climactic final assault on the "" hill "" in question is visually confusing . 

gristly realities are presented in brief flashes , as if the brain dared not acknowledged what it had encountered . 

and in the mud and smoke officer and enlistee , veteran and "" newbie "" , black soldier and white , become almost indistinguishable from each other , as they do in the chaos of actual combat . 

the acting throughout is solid with an absolutely stellar performance rendered by courtney b . vance as doc--in a role that will have many flatly disbelieving that this is same actor they cheered as "" seaman jones "" in mctiernan's red october . 

if you've seen private ryan , you owe it to yourself to see hamburger hill--if only to determine that the all the valour and horror of spielberg's vision was as present in the ashau valley as it was at omaha beach . 
"
"i have never been so confused after watching a movie . 

 "" meet joe black "" is probably one of the most visually satisfying films of this year , with a cinematography , music and cast that will dazzle most of us . 

at the same time it is probably the most boring and ridiculous experience hat you will have this season . 

at first you marvel at the elegant direction , graceful cinematography and sensual musical score . 

then you'll wait for something to happen for half an hour , but when you finally understand what's going on , you'll wonder what are actors such as anthony hopkins , brad pitt and claire forlani are doing in a film like this ? 

the script is simply a silly and unresolved story , which is artificially stretched into a three hour long motion picture . 

it feels like an eternity . 

most of the time it is a pompous soap opera , filled with empty dialogue that the actors deliver in a high pitched voice and "" meaningful "" winks . 

the film is based on alberto caesella's play "" death takes a holiday "" . 

the story concentrates around bill ( anthony hopkins ) who lives a fulfilled life as a successful business man , but sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night and hears a voice that is saying "" yes "" . 

soon he meets a young elegant gentlemen ( brad pitt ) who introduces himself as "" death "" . 

it is bill's time . 

but death has other plans . 

it has come down to us simple mortals to find out what it means to be alive . 

our bill is chosen to be death's guide and in exchange he gets time . 

bill introduces death as joe black , who immediately becomes the center of everyone's attention . 

bill's business partners speculate about why joe is constantly at bill's side , lives in his house and resides at his office . 

that is not all , however . 

bill's youngest daughter susan ( claire forlani ) falls in love with the mysterious stranger and joe falls in love with her . 

this relationship is bound to have some serious consequences . 

it wouldn't be fair to say that this film didn't have some interesting moments , such as the scene where joe is invited to join bill's family for dinner . 

when joe starts enjoying peanut butter and later falls in love , the experience is somewhat different . 

it is obvious that a story like this story is very difficult to structure . 

it's one thing to say : "" wouldn't it be fun to have death take human form and come down to earth . . "" 

to create a motion picture out of this is another . 

four screenwriters have worked on a script that lacks drive and logic . 

it is overlong and too primitive to pass as a serious film . 

on the other hand it demonstrates incredible performances and a very decent direction by martin brest ( "" scent of a woman "" ) . 

hopkins looks great in any role , and no matter how shallow or hollow it is , he will complete it . 

his talent and charisma are needed here more than any where else , since it actually saves the film from a complete embarrassment . 

but pitt is the one that got one of the most difficult roles of recent time . 

how can you play death in human form ? 

to me it seems that death and life are not something that can be associated with earthly matters . 

they are not creatures , but phenomenas . 

saying that death takes human form would be the same as to suggest that eternity would take human form . 

handling such a ridiculous task is incredibly difficult and pitt deserves some credit for his work . 

speaking in a calm , soft voice , portraying death as a lonely , distant and powerful guy that is unfamiliar with practical earthly matters . 

he looks and acts more like an angel of death , rather than a demon or a red-eyed executioner . 

claire forlani and others are also fine , stretching their stereotypical characters to their limits . 

unfortunately their performances are not enough to rescue this film from its self inflicted misery . 

in other words this is not what i expected from the director of "" scent of a woman "" . 

it could ( and should ) be better with such cast and crew . 

in the end it seems as if they have all been intensively working on a ravishingly looking soap opera .

"the postman delivers but not first class 

the postman a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman 

[warning : my opinion of this film is definitely in the minority of reviewers perhaps because it hits so many of my cinematic buttons : post-apocalypse stories , hope in a desperate situation , grassroots uprisings and kevin costner . 

even worse , i thought that "" waterworld "" was watchable . 

read the following with those particular grains of salt . ] 

it's the year 2013 and things have fallen apart . 

due to a world war in the late nineties , the resulting three-year winter and a devastating plague , life in the former united states has been reduced to isolated primitive fiefdoms . 

although this is the future , it looks like a western . 

as the film opens , kevin costner ( his character's name is never revealed ) is wandering the utah wastelands with only his mule bill for company . 

giving extraordinarily bad shakespearean performances in exchange for food and lodging , costner is an outsider in a land of outsiders . 

running into even worse luck , he is forcibly conscripted into the racially pure holnist army of general bethlehem ( will patton ) . 

the rag-tag retro-futuristic cavalry is the descendent of militia groups and is even called the "" clan "" 

after a brutal boot camp , he ( and you can see this coming a mile away ) escapes . 

taking shelter in a wrecked postal truck , he liberates the uniform and mail bag from the skeleton in the cab who no longer has a use for either . 

once he reaches oregon , land of beautiful women , bright youngsters and rock and roll ; he pretends to be a representative from the "" restored congress of the united states of america "" . 

this scam gets him inside the walled towns where the promise of mail delivery renews optimism in the hearts of the inhabitants . 

food and other opportunities come his way in the form of spirited abby ( olivia williams ) who wants him to father a child because her husband is sterile . 

shortly her husband is killed by bethlehem and she and the postman ( as costner is referred to for the rest of the film ) become a reluctant item . 

although the postman knows he's running a fraud , the concept of renewed communications sets the kids' imagination afire ( especially ford lincoln mercury ( larenz tate ) , his second-in-command ) and they form a new pony express dedicated to getting the mail through . 

the revived postal service doubles as an army to fight the holnists' tyranny . 

the postman has become a symbol for hope in a rube goldberg manner . 

although the movie appeals to my sensibilities , there are so many things wrong with it that they can hardly be counted . 

it's derivitive of costner's own "" waterworld "" and clint eastwood westerns . 

there's little here that we haven't seen dozens of times before . 

the film is often down-right corny . 

a scene where the postman is on horseback and grabs a letter from the hands of a bright-eyed child is embarrassing in its slow-motion banality . 

the film's final few minutes should have been left on the cutting room floor . 

despite the film's excessive three hour length , several things are never explained . 

what was the war about ? 

how did civilization change so rapidly ? 

everyone has horses : where did all they come from ? 

the "" law of eights "" that bethlehem lives by seems to have its origins somewhere beyond the film , but where ? 

are we to believe that the rest of the world is in the same shape and hasn't made their way west to help or conquer ? 

there is some jumbled symbolism here that doesn't appear to make sense . 

the tale is obviously saying that communication can defeat evil in much the same way that the internet has the potential to topple governments , but beyond that there are some oddities . 

the evil army is called "" holnists "" which sounds coincidentally like the new age "" holism "" , but why ? 

is it another coincidence that it takes place in 2013 , just one year after many ancient prophesies ( including the ending of the mayan calendar ) predict a new world for mankind ? 

why is the general named "" bethlehem "" ? 

there seems to be some reason for that , but what ? 

sometimes the movie feels like a joke . 

an army of postal workers armed with guns ? 

considering the headlines of recent years , it takes a tremendous leap of faith to cheer for these guys . 

it's even more difficult to accept those re-powering the federal government as the heroes . 

given the current climate of the country and the distrust of big government , it's asking a lot for the audience to get behind the film's nationalism . 

even with its numerous flaws , the movie all comes together , if only for those who have the same weaknesses that i have . 

it's doubtful that "" the postman "" is going to find much of an audience , but a few of us are going to have a good time . 

besides we're all awaiting the fall of civilization caused by the year 2000 millennium computer bug . 

 ( michael redman has written this column for over 22 years and would like to announce that the "" michael redman "" arrested near indianapolis last week for accepting an illicit package from federal express is , to the best of his knowledge , not him . 

perhaps this similarly-named person should have used kevin costner's postal service . ) 
"
" * * the following review contains spoilers * * 

 "" please someone stop joel schumacher before he vomits into a film canister again and tries to pass it off as a movie . "" 

-- chuck dowling , the jacksonville film journal 

i wrote the above sentence in my review for 1997's batman and robin . 

apparently , no one heard my words . 

oh , how i wish you had heard them . 

oh how i wish someone had stopped him . . . 

because he's done it again . 

the plot of 8mm is similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore , a surprisingly decent and engrossing tale . 

in fact , it was everything that 8mm is not . 

in the opening minutes of 8mm , we see private detective tom welles ( nicolas cage ) working on a case for a prestigious member of the u . s . government . 

keep this fact in mind , cage is trusted with an important case , which he solves . 

he returns home to his wife and new daughter , and even finds time to rake his yard ( keep that in mind too , it's important as well ) . 

he's hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery . 

after her husband's death she comes across a film in his private safe . 

it appears to be snuff film , a sort of urban legend of the pornography industry in which someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera . 

the woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film , hopefully to disprove that it is in fact a snuff film . 

so he sets off on a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film . 

the main problem with 8mm is that the whole film is completely pointless . 

welles is actually selected for the case by the old woman's lawyer ( anthony heald , an actor who always plays the same type of character , that being a bad guy ) . 

when you first see him , your first instinct is that he's behind the whole thing . 

the choice of casting does the film in . 

then , as welles begins his investigation , at times we will see a shadowy figure following him . 

the only person it could possibly be is the lawyer ( or someone sent by the lawyer ) because no one knows welles is even investigating anything yet . 

so your first instinct has now been confirmed . 

then , when it is in fact revealed that the lawyer is a part of the whole thing , he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he was young and inexperienced ( in one of those ridiculous "" since we're going to kill you anyway , why not tell you the whole thing "" moments ) . 

but earlier when we see welles being hired for the case he's told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended . 

huh ? 

also , when the lawyer reveals himself to be a part of the whole thing , his main goal is to get the film back . 

so why did he give it up in the first place ? ! 

the lawyer had the film the whole time , then gave it away to the private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case and return the film ? ! 

it's totally absurd . . . 

and this is the screenwriter of seven ? 

late in the film there's a confrontation between all the main characters , and after a struggle one of the character's guns ends up underneath a car . 

cage , who has been handcuffed to a bed , is rapidly trying to get to his gun , which is on a table . 

james gandolfini's character goes for the gun under the car in what is supposed to be a scene of "" suspense "" . 

you see , the gun is just slightly out of reach from the side of the car he's trying to reach it from , and so instead of going around the car to the other side ( where he can easily reach it ) he just keeps stretching . 

go around to the other side of the car ! ! 

this goes on for minutes . 

then , after cage gets his gun , gandolfini then decides it would be best to go around to the other side of the car . 

boy , schumacher is really really getting on my nerves . 

i think the final straw would be when cage returns home , devastated by everything that he's seen on this case , and then is no longer able to rake his lawn ! 

we actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard . 

other things that bugged me about 8mm : one would be the music , if you can call it that . 

whenever the score starts up , it sounds like techno music , and then this awful indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it . 

awful decision there joel . 

another is cage's performance . 

at this point he's capable of a wide range of performances , either good or bad . 

for 8mm , he delivers a very wooden one , and only shines when he's interacting with joaquin phoenix ( who gives a great performance as a porn shop clerk with a heart of gold who helps cage with his case ) . 

you're capable of much better mr . cage . 

now as for you mr . schumacher . . . 

i'm starting to doubt if you're capable of anything else besides urinating onto the institution of american cinema .

drew stars as sally , a dim ( but sweet ) , pregnant waitress at a small town burger joint located somewhere in the southern united states . 

the father of her child is dead , the victim of a severe heart attack brought on by sadistic torture from his two stepsons - these flyboys scared him with their low-flying helicopter . 

dorian ( wilson ) and angus ( busey ) were getting even for his philandering ways on behalf of their anguished mother ( o'hara ) . 

trouble is , sally picked up some interference on her drive-thru headset , and angus worries she may have heard conversations that took place in the helicopter prior to the accidental killing . 

so dorian goes undercover as a burger-flipper ; before you can say "" with cheese "" he falls for the mother-to-be . 

too bad mom and angus have homicidal plans for sally . 

does this sound like a movie you want to see ? 

without a doubt , the best thing about home fries is barrymore ; at the risk of sounding sexist , she's never looked better than here , as a curly redhead with twinkling eyes . 

she is winning in a role that requires her to do absolutely nothing except look apple-cheek cute and gawk at wilson , her real-life boyfriend . 

but the plot and the situations are so off-putting that nothing could save it . 

this movie desperately wants to get mentioned in the same breath as the coen brothers , but home fries' brand of laboured hipness would be foreign to geniuses like ethan and joel . 

it's raising arizona without babies , without charm , without laughs , without human characters , and without intelligence ; worst of all , it's creepy . 

what's funny about threatening to gun down a pregnant woman with a machine gun ? 

 ( unless the woman in question is a spice girl . ) 

take out the helicopters , the quasi-incestuous relationship between the mother and her sons ( it is absolutely illogical , within the movie's framework , that dorian still lives with his mother and brother ) , and the scenes of murder ( attempted and otherwise ) , and what are you left with ? 

the story of a single woman with child who works at a fast food joint ( but dreams of becoming a country singer ) . 

that could turn out to be the most boring movie ever made , but it'd be better than home fries .

"ingredients : james bond , scuba scene , car controlled by cellular telephone 

synopsis : warped media tycoon elliot carver ( jonathan pryce ) plots to start a war between britain and china in order to boost ratings by using a 'stealth ship' to fire a captured british missile at the city of beijing . 

super-agent james bond ( pierce brosnan ) uses trick gadgets , pluck , and charm in order to foil carver's scheme . 

this time bond teams up with top female agent wai lin from china ( michelle yeoh ) . 

the film contains fights , chases , gadgets , and comedic moments . 

opinion : it does not have a casino scene or a ski scene , but tomorrow never dies is nevertheless a solid , enjoyable bond movie . 

it neither stands out nor disappoints . 

in old bond movies bond sometimes teamed up with american cia agent felix leiter . 

tomorrow never dies introduces a new character in the form of chinese agent wai lin . 

like leiter's character , wai lin would be a sure bet for a cameo in a later bond movie . 

stars : michelle yeoh was born a leo in the western zodiac in the year of the tiger on the asian astrology calendar . 

i dont believe in horoscopes . 

but at an airport i once browsed an astrology book with a section on leo tigers ( lts ) . 

 "" leo tigers prefer enough solitude to grow at their own pace . 

lts are unbelievably courageous when facing adversity . 

the lt is also classy , and has an excellent sense of refinement , but she sees herself as an adventurer , and prefers freedom of movement rather than flashy status symbols . 

this person loves family and friends with a fierce loyalty . 

she delights in siblings , nephews , nieces and extended family - - but she must have her personal freedom to come and go as she pleases . 

sometimes annoyance at injustice drives her to take up one or two causes . 

in love life , the lt has an unfortunate mental block against committing to any partner who is less powerful than she . "" 

in real life , michelle yeoh is asia's top female star . 

like jackie chan , she does her own stunts . 

she was born in malaysia - - a country of many languages - - and her primary language ( the language she speaks in her sleep ) is english . 

she was taught malay in school , and learned cantonese from bilingual parents . 

as an athlete michelle represented malaysia internationally . 

she enjoyed squash , diving , swimming , and rugby . 

she studied ballet at the royal academy of dance in london , but switched to drama after a spinal injury . 

in 1983 she won the miss malaysia pageant - - without really intending to , since a family member had entered her in the contest without her knowledge . 

notoriety from the contest led eventually to a movie career as an action heroine . 

michelle has survived a divorce with asian retail tycoon dickson poon ; a nearly fatal stunt accident falling from a freeway overpass which put her in the hospital for three months , and ; a retirement from the movies . 

her comeback from retirement , supercop ( 1992 ) became the top grossing film in asia that year . 

it is not clear what michelles martial arts style is , but it may be a theatrical version of wing chun . 

of her character wai lin in tomorrow never dies , michelle says , "" wai lin is the first bond girl who is on a par with bond , someone who can match up with him mentally and physically . "" 

my own opinion is that casting michelle yeoh as agent wai lin was an excellent choice .

"after a stylistic detour with mrs . 

parker and the vicious circle ( which , despite its uncomfortable tone , was close to being a conventional movie ) , director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self-absorption . 

while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph's atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing , if not always pleasant , movie . 

it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ? meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it . 

until mrs . 

parker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies . 

i found equinox , his last pre- mrs . 

parker effort , to be irritating and frustrating . 

i was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow . 

there are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , mannered aspects of his approach . 

the characters here are more like real people with genuine problems , the story is absorbing , and the acting is top-notch . 

in short , rudolph has created a world that it's worth spending two hours in . 

afterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples . 

jeffrey byron ( jonny lee miller ) is a cold , seemingly-heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife , marianne ( lara flynn boyle ) . 

for her part , marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level . 

all she's interested in is seducing him during those few days when she's ovulating . 

after he refuses to make love , she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor . 

the other couple , lucky ( nick nolte ) and phyllis mann ( julie christie ) , are an older pair , but they're no more content than jeffrey and marianne . 

a mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart . 

they remain married as a matter of convenience , but , since phyllis won't allow lucky to touch her , they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs . 

the landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable . 

the four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey . 

the two of them are immediately attracted to one another , and it doesn't take long before they're lounging together , naked , in her pool . 

meanwhile , jeffrey , who is captivated by older women , runs into phyllis in a hotel bar , is smitten , and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains . 

the romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love . 

sex means something different to everyone ? to jeffrey , it's an unpleasant chore , a loss of control ; to marianne , it's a means to a maternal end ; to lucky , it's an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles ; and to phyllis , it's a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness . 

ultimately , none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves . 

the greatest strength of the film lies not in the script , but in the performances . 

jonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish , callous , suit-and-tie businessman . 

those who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity . 

lara flynn boyle , who wasn't impressive in rudolph's equinox , is greatly improved , making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability . 

nick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky , and he manages to deliver some of rudolph's most pregnant lines with practiced ease . 

the clear standout , however , is julie christie , who is nothing short of delicious as the world-weary phyllis . 

her often wry , occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film's humor , and there's hardly ever a moment when she doesn't steal the spotlight from her co-stars . 

i don't know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph- detractors , but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director's earlier productions . 

enough of his trademark style remains , however , to reassure his supporters . 

afterglow is basically a four-pronged character study . 

the plot is not especially compelling , but the character interaction is , and that's the real reason to see this motion picture . 

rudolph has painted an able picture of the non-romantic side of love -- the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction .

" "" varsity blues "" is the best film of 1999 thus far . 

unfortunately , it is also the first film i have seen from 1999 . 

it is another one of those small-town sports movies that involves a flawed , but good-heartedfrom 1999 . 

it is another one of those small-town sports movies that involves a flawed , but good-hearted protagonist ; a rough and meanspirited coach ; and the "" big game . "" 

by the end , will the underdog overcome great odds and triumph ? 

will everyone in the town turn against the coach ? 

will the team win the climactic game ? 

do cats bathe themselves regularly ? 

the so-called "" hero "" in question is john moxin ( james van der beek ) , a senior at west canaan high school who plays for the varsity football team , but is really just hoping to get a scholarship at brown university so that he can get out of the dead-end town . 

at least he's got the right idea , since west canaan , texas is portrayed in the film as , frankly , pathetic , with the whole town treating the weekly football games as the second coming . 

heck , in one scene , the front page of the town's newspaper is proclaiming about the west canaan badgers' big win the night before . 

when the team's star quarterback is severely injured , tearing the ligaments in his leg , john finds himself taking over as the team's leader , but his few minutes of glory do not last long , as he begins to have problems with his girlfriend ( amy smart ) when she discovers he spent an evening with another girl ( ali larter ) . 

and after staying out all night with his drinking buddies at a strip joint ( all of the teenagers in the film are portrayed as raging alcoholics ) , the team loses their second-to-last game , putting john at feuds with the coach ( jon voight who , like gary oldman , is overstaying his welcome in the typecasted role as the "" bad guy "" ) . 

worse yet , the coach is threatening to ruin john's scholarship chances if the badgers don't win their final game . 

the plotting of "" varsity blues "" is as old as the hills , and contains every cliche in the book . 

admittedly , i was never exactly bored while i was watching it , but i hasten to add that i was rarely ever entertained . 

throughout , all i could really think of is how virtually the same exact story had been filmed with a great deal more thoughtfulness and maturity in 1983's "" all the right moves . "" 

one of the biggest problems i had with the film is how little of interest any of the characters actually were , least of all certainly not john , who , played by van der beek ( of tv's "" dawson's creek "" ) , is pretty much a bore without any engaging qualities . 

while i probably shouldn't blame this on van der beek , since the inauspicious and "" by-the-numbers "" screenplay by w . peter iliff isn't of any help , he is still certainly not in the league of tom cruise in "" all the right moves . "" 

the story revolving around john , meanwhile , is extemely thin throughout , particularly for its 104-minute running time , and it alternates between uninspired comic relief ( as in when the students see their sex education teacher working as a stripper at the club ) and heavy-handed melodrama . 

the romance between john and his girlfriend had the potential to be an adequate subplot , but we also learned very little about her , which is unfortunate since amy smart , whom i don't think i've seen before in past films , is probably the only character written with any sort of intelligence . 

smart does not allow her character to become the "" passive girlfriend , "" instead coming off as a young woman with her own ideas and opinions . 

it's too bad the camera didn't linger on her long enough so we could hear some of those thoughts . 

the adult characters probably fare the worse of any , since they all must play residents of a dim-witted town that cares about nothing but football . 

john's relationship with his parents can also be telegraphed far in advance . 

his father is set on him becoming a football player at a university , but john doesn't want any part of that . 

his mother stands beside her "" big , strong husband "" and is a passive female . 

finally , jon voight plays the stock bully coach character and he does nothing to make the thankless role any more than one-dimensional . 

saving "" varsity blues "" from being a total washout are a few amusing sequences , including one set in the sex education class , which did get a laugh out of me . 

the scenes of playing football were well-shot and thankfully didn't overstay their welcome , as many sports films fall victim to . 

but leaving the theater , the question i had in my mind was why did this film need to be made ? 

i seem to be asking this question quite a lot lately , since the same old stories seem to be cranking out of hollywood . 

do we really need another high-school sports film ? 

no , we don't , and certainly not one of this low-caliber , which felt like a cut-and-paste job of spare parts from much better , but similar , films . 

 "" varsity blues , "" no doubt is the first one , however , to include an earnest scene in which one of the characters is only wearing whipped cream on their private parts .

"based on the 1960s tv series that i had never seen or heard of before this movie ( be happy , i won't bore you with any lame and unnecessary comparisons ) , this film allows will smith to take a third stab at the independence day weekend box-office , after scoring huge successes with men in black ( 7/10 ) , directed by the same man who controlled this one , and independence day ( 6/10 ) . 

can you say . . . the 

third times not a charm ? 

plot : james west and artemus gordon are chosen by the president to find the man responsible for the kidnapping of the nation's top scientists , and threatening to take over the united states within a week . 

critique : i did not laugh once during this entire picture . 

when you consider that this film is a part-comedy , that's not a very good sign . 

i also did not tense up or particularly enjoy any of its unenergetic action sequences which provided me with little more than a few minutes time to think back to the lovely salma hayek scenes . 

when you consider that the other "" part "" of this film is geared as an action/adventure , i would say that this another negative sign . 

and when you consider that the first hour of the film was boring and a little slow , the story-line tired , reminiscent of swiss cheese and uninvolving , and the special effects interesting but worth very little inside a plot filled with lame one-liners , weak characterizations and an anti-climactic end , you pretty much have the gist of my impression of this "" big "" summer blockbuster . 

it blows . 

or as they say in french , "" eet blows "" . 

could it be that the script was crappy because it took four people to write it ? 

maybe . 

could it be that most of the special effects don't show up until the last half hour , and even then , we don't see anything that its trailers hadn't already given away ? 

perhaps . 

or could it be that we have come to expect so much more from will smith and hollywood big-budget movies , that we cannot help but evaluate them on a scale onto their own ? 

naaaaaaah ! 

a bad movie is a bad movie . 

on a positive note , i could honestly say that i did very much enjoy the lovely performance by the adorable salma hayek , who seemed underused ( in my humble opinion ) , and lit up every bubbly scene that she was hardly in . 

branagh was also fun as the scenery-munching , over-the-top bad guy , but that's pretty much where the entertainment-buck stopped . 

smith and kline were static at best , the plot full of holes , and the score insignificant and derivative of a dozen others . 

i would strongly advise anyone not to see this movie . 

then again , there is that one scene with the lovely salma hayek tied up in a cage . . . huh . . . oh 

yeah , but the rest of the movie sucked . 

little known facts about this film and its stars : will smith has starred in two of the ten all-time top grossing films worldwide : 1997's summer blockbuster men in black ( 7/10 ) , for which he also recorded the grammy-winning title song , and 1996's independence day ( 6/10 ) . 

he once turned down a scholarship to mit to pursue his singing career . 

kevin kline is a graduate of the juilliard school of drama , and has been married to the cute-as-a-button actress phoebe cates since 1989 . 

they have two kids together , greta simone and owen . 

one of the buildings that gets blown up in this film has "" kasdan "" written on it . 

lawrence kasdan is a director known to have worked with kevin on five of his movies , including the big chill , silverado , i love you to death , grand canyon and french kiss . 

salma hayek gave up a successful career as a major television star in latin america and moved to the united states to start over , even though she spoke no english . 

she made her feature film debut as an actress with a small role in allison anders' mi vida loca ( no , not the rickie martin video ! ) and played her first starring role in robert rodriguez's desperado opposite antonio banderas . 

since then , she has made an appearance in each one of rodriguez's films . 

she stands 5'2 "" , was born in southeast mexico , and the daughter of a lebanese father and a mexican mother . 

one of the actresses cast as branagh's lovely but lethal beauties includes bail ling , a stage and screen star in her native china who was last seen starring opposite dick gere in red corner ( 7/10 ) . 

another is dutch-born frederique van der wal , who is one of the world's most recognized supermodels , having graced the cover of cosmopolitan numerous times , as well as harper's bazaar , vogue and mademoiselle .

"no , i did not read the novel by thomas hardy , "" jude the obscure , "" his final novel ( final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again - see : i did do some research on it ) about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life . 

but , after watching the movie , i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is . 

 "" jude "" is a satirical film from start to finish about society's way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system , but what's remarkable is how timeless this film is . 

the film takes place in the late 19th century ( or early 20th - wasn't really sure ) , but its story could even be retold today in modern form , although it'd be kinda different ( a given ) . 

it tells the story of jude ( christopher eccleston - the psychotic accountant from "" shallow grave "" ) - a simple , dim-witted young man with big dreams . 

in its bleak , foreboding opening , shot in grainy black and white , he gets a lesson from phillotson ( liam cunningham ) , his teacher : as they stand upon a mountain , looking upon a city in the distance , he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world . 

after marrying and divorcing an immature woman named arabella ( rachel griffiths ) because they frolicked in the hay ( literally ) but did not ultimately share anything in common , he moves away to a town with a giant university , with a chance to learn more , and get ahead in life . 

taking a welding job , he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars , reciting latin over and over again , and training himself . 

but when he sends his application for the school in , he is bluntly told to just remain a worker . 

another reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives there : sue ( kate winslet ) , his cousin and a very intelligent but kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher . 

she and jude click eventually and become very endearing friends , so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job ( for none other than phillotson at the local school ) , there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business ( nudge nudge ) . 

several twists turn in the storyline , and eventually jude and sue do do some nasty business ( an interesting scene , to say the least . . . ) , and are soon born into a controversial non-wedlock , as she eventually gives birth to their baby , and jude inherits his son from arabella , who turns up again after awhile . 

because they aren't married , and because they're cousins , they run into problems with every place they go to , carrying around two children everywhere , and only staying in lodges for a very brief period of time , then moving on . 

if you didn't think this was harsh enough , wait till you see what happens later on . . . 

the sad truth is that jude is one of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world . 

he will never gain any true happiness , and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting , and will probably bring more horrible instances to his life . 

part of it is his fault - he's too optimistic , and too gullible . 

but society has a way of taking these people , and hurting them until their death . 

the ending of "" jude "" is bleak because it has to be ( although i hear the ending of the novel is even worse - guess i'll have to read it now ) . 

 "" jude "" offers a satirical view on society's cruelties , but shows no way of curing this , and thank heavens it doesn't . 

there's no way to relinquish the selfishness of society , and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem . 

satire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain people's minds , and that's what "" jude "" is . 

sure , it's one hell of a downer , but it needs to be . 

the film also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads , and some good supporting work along with it . 

christopher eccleston ( slightly resembling richard edson with his new look and dumb expression ) plays jude wonderfully , sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face , and making him kind of child-like at other times . 

kate winslet , in a pre- "" titanic "" performance , is brilliant , nailing every psyche of her character , and creating someone who's troubled but very seductive with her personality . 

kate may be the best actress in her age group ( if you don't believe me , see "" titanic , "" branagh's "" hamlet , "" "" sense and sensibility , "" and "" heavenly creatures , "" the latter one being my favorite performance of hers ) . 

in the supporting roles , liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher , exposing all his bad parts , but ultimately being a pretty good person ; and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as jude's wife , whom he never divorces . 

 "" jude "" moves at a very slow pace , and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists , which would drive some people nuts . 

but those who appreciate good social commentary with their films , no matter how slow or downright depressing they are ( this one is both ) will appreciate "" jude , "" though i doubt anyone truly enjoys it .

"when i originally saw the trailer for "" analyze this "" a few months ago , i must admit , i thought it looked kind of lame . 

and then when the commercials started popping up a week or two ago , i thought it looked outright bad . 

but then when "" analyze this "" finally opened a few days ago , an odd thing happened . 

it got great reviews . 

critics were proclaiming it "" hilarious "" and a "" dead-on parody of mob movies "" . 

well , with praise like that , i figured , it must be good and so i headed off to the theater . 

you know that expression that says always trust your gut instincts ? 

well , turns out that expression is more valid than i ever gave it credit for . 

 "" analyze this "" is slow , unfunny , and badly acted . 

don't get me wrong , i think that deniro is one of the top ten greatest actors of the century , but he is just out of his league here . 

i think the problem is he didn't quite know how to approach this material . 

he plays his character , mob boss paull vitti , somewhere in between the realm of comedy and drama . 

if he had played the character straight , along the lines of leslie nielson in the "" naked gun "" series , he probably would have been a lot more successful . 

as it is , though , he plays the character completely serious at some moments , and for laughs at others . 

this doesn't work . 

it creates an uneven character that never breaks out of the deniro mold ; you always know it's him . 

and the movie is badly paced , too . 

it never takes off . 

it just crawls from one scene to another without any forward momentum . 

i think the blame for this should be placed on the script . 

it's obvious the writer had a good idea for a movie , mob boss faces breakdown and needs the services of a psychiatrist , but once this is established , the movie doesn't really go anywhere . 

the formula of the film seems to be this : billy crystal says no to deniro , deniro forces him , and much wackiness ensues . 

this formula of sorts is repeated several times throughout the movie . 

i've said it before and i'll say it again : the only thing that matters to me in a comedy is whether or not it's funny . 

if "" analyze this "" had been funny , the pacing and bad acting wouldn't have bothered me . 

i would have been too busy laughing to notice . 

but as it is , i only chuckled a few times . 

the only really funny scene is a dead-on parody of "" the godfather "" . 

sadly , though , i don't think anyone in the audience i saw it with realized it was a parody , because i was the only one laughing . 

but my sense of humour , i have come to realize , is vastly different from the general population . 

i loathed "" there's something about mary "" , yet loved "" baseketball "" . 

now , if you want a movie that * i * think is funny , go out and see "" office space "" . 

it's full of genuine laughs and won't leave you glancing at your watch every 10 minutes , as "" analyze this "" did . 
"
"it seems that i've stopped enjoying movies that should be fun to watch . 

take payback , for example , a movie that most people seem to like . 

however , it's horrible schlock , straight out of hollywood's vast talent for sucking creativity out of movies . 

it was written and directed by a guy who should have done better ; however , maybe he did do better , after all , 30 percent of the movie isn't his own . 

mel gibson , that hollywood zombie , decided he didn't like the ending and had another director reshoot it . 

what a crock . 

if you sign on to do a movie , then do it the way the script calls for . 

why film a movie and then look at it later and say , - no , i changed my mind , i don't like the ending . 

you're fired . 

let's get someone else to do it . 

- i suppose honor is dead in hollywood . 

the end of the film is , of course , hollywoodized . 

which is to say that it's happy and the guy you root for beats impossible odds to win his prize . 

in this case , as is most victories in hollywood movies , gibson's prize is a blond and money . 

i miss originality in film , i really do . 

i think audiences are so starved for it that they'll flop down a lot of money in hopes that a movie will be original . 

payback's tagline - get ready to root for the bad guy - promised an original idea , but it was far from the truth . 

while gibson's character certainly broke the law , he was a character that had honor ( odd that gibson himself seems to have very little of it ) , wouldn't kill in front of children and protects his blond woman . 

there's nothing bad about him - he's a hollywood character , a person who could never exist in real life . 

and gibson knows it - he spends his time trying to act like a "" bad guy "" , and instead comes off as pretentious and arrogant . 

the story involves gibson being double-crossed by his partner ( who is a real bad guy , which made me wish that we could root for him ) over $70 , 000 . 

gibson recovers from multiple gunshots , is pissed ( naturally ) , and will do whatever it takes to get the exact amount of money back - no more , no less . 

he makes a point of it that it's strictly 70 grand . 

a real bad guy would have made his ex-partner pay 25% interest . 

this idea is completely stretched out . 

gibson ends up going after his partner and the chicago mafia that his partner is affiliated with . 

what i didn't understand - this is the chicago mafia . 

$70 , 000 is like spare change to them . 

they'd probably just pay the guy rather than go through the trouble of dealing with him . 

i think they'd respect a guy going through this much trouble for a simple $70 , 000 . 

maybe i'm being too hard on the movie . 

perhaps the filmmakers were just trying to make a simple popcorn movie . 

i read roger ebert's review and he liked gibson in the role because he is a comic at heart playing a bad guy . 

that's why we're allowed to root for him . 

and it's true - gibson walks the movie as if he's smiling at a joke he just heard . 

but he's wrong here . 

i wanted a lee marvin or old-time clint eastwood or somebody who wasn't a comic , just an ass kicker . 

as a side note , i've just checked the internet movie database and discovered that i am the 38th person to post a newsgroup review of payback . 

after this many reviews , why would anyone want to read this ? 

really , i don't care . 

i'm just trying to gain membership into the on-line film critics society by posting as many reviews as i can .

"a friend invites you to a movie . 

this film would evade the explosions and special effects of standard summer fare , and be grounded in reality . 

the plot is as follows : after a terrifying incident , a mother and her independent daughter separate from the father and move away from the city . 

they need fresh air to get some perspective , maybe to start over . 

romance begins to brew , however , as one of the locals , played by an international superstar in rugged clothing , sparks things up , ( especially at a country-western slow dance ) . 

it stars a rising young starlet , helms a good cast , and is directed by one of the better actor-turned-directors in hollywood .

but , poor moviegoer , you have been conned .

it is a travesty on nearly every level , and has the authority to sink the careers of nearly everyone involved . 

at the hands of a better script , the film could have been a gem . 

but it is clueless as to what it is about , and only succeeds in transferring same cluelessness to us poor viewers . 

_hope floats_ stars sandra bullock as birdy , who , after discovering her husband has been cheating on her with her best friend ( on national television no less ) , takes her daughter and drives back to her home , helmed by a countryish bumpkin eccentric played by gena rowlands , ( she decorates with stuffed wildlife ) . 

birdy's nephew , travis ( played by _leave it to beaver_'s cameron finley ) , is under her custody , and in one of the film's many failed in-jokes , is always seen wearing a different halloween costume . 

what is the point of this ? 

does it make any sense ? 

is it supposed to be funny ? 

the point of the film is to show that the family is eccentric , but i was convinced that the grandma should have been locked up for endangering the mental welfare of a child . 

all of this undercuts the plot , of which there is none . 

there are only many scenes that are supposed to register emotion . 

there's the scene where birdy , who used to be the prom queen , is humbled by approaching a peer she once mocked , for a job . 

there's the scene where birdy dances with her father , in the hospital for alzheimer's . 

and then there's the sentimental scenes with justin , played by harry connick jr . , who is taking a liking to her again , showing her a beautiful pad that he built from scratch . 

and during each of these scenes , i was sidetracked by my earlier question . 

what sort of eccentric grandmother go through such great pains as to provide a dog costume , a kermit costume , a cowboy costume ( with whip ) , and a full furred barney costume for her grandson to wear during dinner ? 

what sort of warped ramifications would this lead for the rest of his life ? 

outside of this , there are other sure signs of screenwriters block . 

when the daughter stands up to the bully at school . 

when birdy almost loses her job . 

when the family pulls in a goofy lip-synch to cheer someone up . 

when someone dies . 

when the daughter cries , ( no , wails ) in exasperation that her father is not coming back . 

in a movie like this , you notice the strings being pushed , and you sit there , comatose , hoping it will end . 

who can survive such a debacle ? 

i worry for bullock's career , which has been running on auto-pilot for the last few years . 

she has an attitude , a solid perkiness , and can drive a bus--but she can't handle the emotional scenes , much less hold a southern accent . 

harry connick , jr . is worse--stick with singing , or get some acting lessons , please ! 

gena rowlands is the best part of the film . 

but she's such a good actress , that it staggers the mind that she's weighed down by such lukewarm material here . 

it would be a severe tragedy if the recurring star of john cassavettes' great films is known for this film . 

two notes to forest whittaker : ( 1 ) cut the slow-motion sequences . 

there are twelve times where you undercut your own direction by such a failed trick . 

have you done so , you could have shaved off ten-minutes of this almost unbearable debacle . 

 ( 2 ) you've had to know something was wrong if your cinematographer's filter makes the candlelight appear like little "" x "" s . 

you're not a bad director , but you can't change a terrible script . 

there's a recurring scene where birdy , working at the neighborhood fotomat , finds the machine go wrong , and image after destroyed , warped , dark image appear . 

think about it . 

a succession of destroyed images may have been more entertaining than this movie .

"one of the best things about my job is that , every so often , a film still catches me by surprise . 

 "" spy kids "" certainly did . 

an adventure story aimed primarily at children , the movie is smart , zippy fun . 

the production neither panders nor talks down to its audience . 

the brother and sister at the center of the tale are believable , likable kids and their parents are ? get ready for this ? intelligent , capable and loving . 

bathroom humor is kept to a minimum and the numerous well-staged action scenes avoid excessive violence . 

what a relief it is to be able to review an all-ages film on its artistic merits and not its ethics . 

consider the other pg rated "" family friendly "" movie in theaters now . 

 "" see spot run "" has a mother going out of town , leaving her son with an idiot neighbor . 

body function humor abounds , including a slapstick bit that has the adult male lead repeatedly falling in dog poop . 

what really disturbs me are the jokes that bookend the film . 

the story begins with a police dog capturing a mobster and biting off one of his testicles in the process . 

at the hospital , the doctors explain that they replaced the testicle with a metal ball and joke that the victim is lucky the dog didn't bit off the other one , because two metal replacement balls would clack together . 

of course , the movie ends with the dog biting off the remaining testicle and shows prisoners laughing at the criminal as he clacks past their cells . 

somebody clue me in ? when did genital mutilation become funny ? 

 "" spy kids "" is a welcome antidote to the repellent "" see spot run , "" using imagination instead of cruelty and crudeness . 

carmen ( alexa vega ) and her younger brother juni ( daryl sabara ) live in a beautiful seaside home with their parents , gregorio ( antonio banderas ) and ingrid cortez ( carla gugino ) . 

mom and dad are a sultry couple devoted to their children . 

what the kids don't know is that they are also former spies . 

once agents from different countries assigned to "" erase "" each other , they instead fell in love , married and retired to raise a family . 

needless to say , they get drawn back to the business . 

shortly into their first joint mission , they are captured and end up in the headquarters of fegan floop ( alan cumming ) , a foppish hybrid of willy wonka and pee wee herman who hosts juni's favorite tv show . 

but there is evil behind the scenes , as inventors prepare an army of robots disguised as children . 

papa gregorio has the device necessary to radically increase the efficiency of the creatures and the bad guys will stop at nothing to get it from him . 

back at home , "" uncle "" felix ( cheech marin ) shows up to reveal mom and dad's secret to the kids . 

after a brief respite at a safe house filled with enough cool gadgets for a dozen sharper image stores , carmen and juni set off to find their parents and save the world , zooming through the sea in a submarine pod that looks like a goldfish , while a slew of wicked people ( including teri hatcher ) chase them . 

during the course of their adventures , they get to use jet packs , electroshock bubblegum and super-computer sunglasses . 

they watch as secret agents are transformed into bizarre creatures with silly putty faces and used as background characters on floop's tv show . 

they deal with guards that have huge thumbs where their arms , legs and heads would normally be ( why are the guards so ineffective ? 

because they're all thumbs ! ) 

they move from one colorful locale to another , including a nifty virtual reality room reminiscent of the holodeck from "" star trek . "" 

the storyline is silly and convoluted , but even at its most dense , it is easier to follow than either "" mission : impossible "" movie . 

director robert rodriguez ( "" from dusk to dawn "" ) maintains a frenetic pace , with the whole film clocking in at a mere 86 minutes . 

a bit less action and a little more character development would have been nice , but he does provide enough quiet moments for viewers to become fully invested in the family . 

alexa vega and daryl sabara make an agreeable brother and sister team , squabbling the way kids do , but coming together when it counts . 

antonio banderas and carla gugino are even better as the parents ; they quickly establish and maintain a great lusty chemistry while keeping their tongues properly in cheek during the action scenes . 

even the usually irritating alan cumming has some nice moments ? a virtual cloud-backed chat between his character and juni is one of the best segments in the film . 

had rodriguez added a few more scenes like that , i would have enjoyed the film more ( and i definitely could have lived without the glaring product placement for a certain mc-ubiquitous company ) . 

regardless , "" spy kids "" is a hoot , offering fun for adults and children alike . 

and just think , they managed to do it without sacrificing a single testicle . 
"
"i feel sorry for the financial backers of "" waterworld , "" which is supposedly the most expensive film ever made ( at $172 million ! ) , and is also one of the stupidest - boy did they get ripped off ! 

in fact , this film is not really a movie , but more of an amusement park ride with a plot . 

it's not even just another case of cliches strung together ( well , it is that too ) , it's something that's painful to watch because it relishes in its flaws . 

kevin costner stars as a man who is some kind of mutant half man/half fish . 

he is an explorer/mariner on an alternate earth that is completely covered by water because the polar ice caps melted . 

he's referred to as the mariner , but they "" the meaner "" would have been a more appropriate title because he's cold , rigid , and strict - and he's supposed the be the good guy ! 

he docks at a small floating village of sorts . 

he trades dirt for money and this introduces us to the other important characters . 

first we meet one of the villains , then the soon-to-be heroine , a child prodigy , a wacky inventor , and a group of primitive people that somehow have some of the technology we have today , but also some of the low-tech tools used by pirates and vikings . 

immediately the film's biggest flaw is apparent : are these people primitive or highly advanced ? 

it doesn't seem like anyone can read yet they have ski-doos and airplanes ! 

how are these things powered ? 

and if they have airplanes , couldn't they just keep flying until they reached dry land ? 

also , if the planet is completely covered in water where did they get the materials to make these things ? 

i'm sorry , i'm all for checking your brain at the door when going to the movies , but elements like these cannot go unnoticed because they draw our attention away from the story and confuse us . 

there was potential here for a good pirate story set in medieval times before modern technology , so why mix the two together ? 

it doesn't make any sense . 

there really isn't much of a plot here because the story moves so quickly it never takes time to explain anything . 

the only thing we learn is that the prodigy child , enola ( mojorino ) , has a tattoo on her back that is supposedly a map to "" dryland . "" 

who put the tattoo there and how come it has taken them this long to figure this out ? 

we never get an answer , just a stupid action movie about whoever can get the girl will be the victor of sorts if they reach dryland . 

to make a long , boring , stupid , and just plain bad story short ; the mariner escapes with a woman named helen ( tripplehorn ) and enola . 

they sail for a long time , encountering some strange people in the process and fight off "" the smokers "" as lead by the idiot villain deacon ( hopper ) , who kidnaps enola . 

the story becomes a overly grand adventure with the mariner taking on an army of goons , rescuing enola , and bringing them all to salvation ( how original ) . 

even with all its special effects , action , and adventure this film is boring . 

not a single character is likable , therefore neither is the plot . 

dennis hopper completely rips off jack nicholson's joker , while costner just plain rips . 

still , "" waterworld "" is professionally made with a good production design and an original idea but no substance to it . 

i just hope they don't make a sequel ! 
"
"vikings v . bears ? 

no , this isn't the lineup for monday night football . 

rather , these are the two opposing forces that will battle to the death in "" the 13th warrior , "" a film that is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory . 

based on michael crichton's book , eaters of the dead , this viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen and the glorious battles that they fought . 

their strength and honor would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest warriors that ever picked up a sword . 

luckily for the vikings , however , their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film . 

antonio bandaras is ahmed , a travelling ambassador . 

accompanied by his friend ( omar shariff in a cameo ) , they eventually come across a small viking village . 

we see that the vikings are an extremely proud group whose greatest strength is their fortitude . 

they laugh heartily , revel in their arrogance , and sing songs of battles won . 

but their festivities are about to be halted when a messenger boy arrives to tell the village leader that a great evil is threatening their land . 

help is needed quickly . 

an elderly , fortune-telling witch arrives . 

after a brief incantation , she proclaims that 12 warriors and one more "" not of norse blood "" are needed to ensure victory . 

personally , i always wonder why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly and on the brink of insanity . 

nonetheless , 12 men eagerly accept their place while ahmed becomes the pivotal 13th . 

the group then sets out to do the greatest battle of their lives . 

of course during their ride , ahmed becomes the target of fun for the other 12 burly viking warriors . 

but he ably shows that it's not the size of the dog in the fight but rather the size of the fight in the dog . 

he is able to overcome the proud arrogance of the vikings , but will his skills ( and that of the group ) be enough to defeat whatever evil is menacing the countryside ? 

it does not look promising . 

these creatures , resembling bears , are strong and have high morale . 

they are fearless and display a desire for decapitating the heads of their enemies . 

they attack by the hundreds and the next strike will come soon . 

the warriors prepare their defenses and pray to their gods . 

they are ready to sacrifice their lives . 

 "" this is a good way to die , "" says one of the fallen warriors . 

despite the larger-than-life battle sequences , i was unmoved by the entire experience . 

at many points , i was even confused . 

for example , somewhere in the middle of the film , a sub-plot creeps up involving the prince of the threatened land . 

he seems to have an agenda to elevate himself to greater power during this crisis . 

however , the sub-plot never fully materializes , and we are left scratching our heads as to the purpose of its inclusion . 

there are other questions that i had , but the real problem was that the story ( little of it that there was ) offered no characters to love or hate . 

the leader of the viking warriors had the most charisma . 

however , banderas's role is completely underwritten and it is unclear why being the 13th warrior makes him so special . 

an entire rewrite of the ahmed character is in order . 

also , much of the action takes place during torrential downpours or at night , which made battles very difficult to follow . 

i would have preferred more time looking at the viking culture and how their beliefs shaped their decision to do battle against the enemy . 

as it stands , the film manages more confusion than intensity . 

it would make thor cry .

"tim burton has now completed his evolution from the brilliant director of macabre stories about outcast individuals yearning for acceptance , and into a studio monkey whose name is used as part of multi-tiered marketing materials for crap movies . 

and here he hits rock bottom , with planet of the apes . 

i didn't expect much from this latest "" interpretation "" of pierre boulle's classic novel planet of the apes . 

i mean , how could you top the force and impact of the original film , intelligently co-scripted by rod serling ( of twilight zone fame ) combined with the overbearing chuck heston growling and yelling at those "" damn dirty apes , "" in one of his best roles of his career ? 

sadly , i sat down to watch burton's version of planet of the apes and within the first 20 minutes , i was checking my watch and my girlfriend ( a big fan of the original film ) started to nod off . 

this time around , the story plays out like a cross between enemy mine , braveheart , and project x . marky mark wahlberg , who was enjoyable in boogie nights and the corrupter , plays leo davidson , a hot shot u . s . air force pilot . 

leo and his crew are in search of some mysterious magnetic storms ( no real explanation given in the film ) and leo sends one of his genetically altered "" smart "" chimps into the storms to collect data . 

leo and his crew lose communication with the chimp , leo hops in another ship to find the monkey , and then he's thrown through some type of time-space wormhole which crashes lands on the twentieth century fox studio backlot , all mocked up to look like the amazon jungle . 

leo ends up getting captured by a group of talking apes and is sold to a slave trader named limbo ( paul giamatti ) who in turn sells leo to a chimpanzee named ari ( helena bonham carter ) . 

the kind ari then helps leo and his fellow humans escape to the mountains to find leo's ship . 

along the way , monkeys played by tim roth ( overacting his role of a vicious general named thade ) and michael clarke duncan ( who further enhances his career by playing another heavy in a bad action movie ) strive out to hunt down leo and his band of human savages , just like battlefield earth ! 

in the end , it all culminates into another braveheart rip-off human versus ape battle scene . 

while rick baker's makeup work is amazing , the script is a pathetic hodgepodge ( courtesy of three writers ) , the acting is horrible , and the "" surprise "" ending feels like a swing from a ball-peen hammer into the temple . 

wahlberg does not have the physical or mental presence of a chuck heston to carry the film or any of its action sequences . 

this remake , or re-interpretation , as tim burton has proclaimed it , is an insult to the intelligence and wit of the original film . 

the ethical arguments about the equality of species , fascism , and military buildup have been replaced by tremendous amounts of ridiculous dialogue , an unimaginative narrative structure , and a romance between a monkey and a human . 

even chuck heston's anti-gun tirade ( in the de rigeur cameo ) seems shallow and jokey . 

but the main element missing from this tim burton film is tim burton . 

even though his name is plastered across every billboard in america , john badham could have directed this film . 

even joel schumacher could have directed this film . 

he probably should have . 

burton's predominant themes of rejection , isolation , and the search for one's place in the universe , as seen in ed wood , edward scissorshands , and pee-wee's big adventure , are completely absent in this planet . 

i suppose that's what happen when a great director gets sucked through a wormhole . 
"
"krippendorf's tribe is a formula comedy . 

done poorly , formulaic comedies might seem to signify the downfall of american cinema . 

however , every now and then , one emerges , like krippendorf's tribe , that actually works . 

professor james krippendorf ( richard dreyfuss ) , the renowned anthropologist , is in trouble . 

his university gave him a hefty grant to discover a lost tribe in new guinea . 

however , he found . . . nothing . 

his wife has recently died , and he has spent the remainder of the grant money in raising his three kids : shelly ( natasha lyonne ) , mickey ( gregory smith ) and edmund ( carl michael lidner ) . 

tonight , he is expected to lecture on his newfound tribe . 

rather than break the news ( and face the consequences of misusing his funds ) , he invents a tribe : the shelmikedmu ( named after his kids ) . 

however , one lie begets another as he is not only required to deliver filmed proof of the shelmikedmu , but his research becomes a popular phenomenon . 

soon , professor krippendorf is caught up in an elaborate ruse in which he films mockumentary footage starring his children as the shelmikedmu tribal members . 

his efforts are hampered by the boasts of an over-eager colleague , veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , and the intense scrutiny of a rival anthropologist , ruth allen ( lily tomlin ) . 

krippendorf's tribe does seem to require a little suspension of disbelief . 

no one seems to question the way his field documentaries seem to be shot with multiple cameras , or that his newly discovered tribesmen have startlingly blue eyes . 

luckily , as the film builds momentum , that suspension of disbelief is easy to come by . 

though there's some mild humor in the krippendorf family trying to pass themselves off as a lost tribe , the real humor of the film is in how james gets trapped in his ever increasing snowball of lies . 

the double meanings to many of the shelmikedmu appearances are enjoyable , and the comic timing required for some of the film's latter scenes is superb . 

richard dreyfuss is terrific as the hapless professor who soon loses control of his own imaginary tribe . 

jenna elfman's position as a romantic lead seems a bit forced at times , but she plays the part with extreme affability . 

even the kids , who in films like this tend to be a bit on the precocious side , are endearing and humorous . 

yes , the film does veer occasionally into some rather lowbrow humor , but it has the best excuse of all : it's funny . 

it may not go down as an all-time classic , but it certainly delivers what you expect from a comedy : plenty of laughs .

"in the mid-1980s , following the splendid debut in hugh hudson's greystoke and relative success of first highlander film , it looked like christopher lambert's acting career might go somewhere . 

but , it wasn't meant to be , which became obvious following highlander ii . 

in this decade christopher lambert became associated with films with low budgets and even lower quality . 

very often such films were science fiction , which meant that the fans of that genre learned the hard way what to evade anything starring christopher lambert . 

whether it was because of real lack of talent , terrible miscasting or simple bad luck isn't important - the end result was almost always horrible . 

the same can be said for fortress , 1993 science fiction film directed by stuart gordon , director who created cult following with his 1980s horror gorefests like reanimator and from beyond . 

the movie is set in 2018 . 

for some undisclosed reason , usa introduced strict population control and couples are barred from having more than one child . 

jake ( christopher lambert ) and karen brennick ( lori laughlin ) broke that law and are caught by authorities on the border . 

sentenced to 31 years in prison , they are both thrown into fortress , privately owned correctional facility , equiped with state-of-the-art futuristic technology and run by computer called zed . 

although equiped with gismos that regulate every aspect of inmates' lives and make any escape impossible , prison authorities often use violence . 

jake survives many ordeals and earns respect of some inmates which would help him when he begins planing the escape . 

such escape should become necessity , because the warden poe ( kurtwood smith ) begins showing unhealthy interest in karen . 

after rather intriguing beginning and some interesting special effects that depict the futuristic settings of prison , this film soon starts sinking into mediocrity . 

the reason is in the screenplay that quickly degenerates into whole series of prison movie clich ? s and situations that are painfully predictable . 

by the time brennick begins his escape from fortress , those situations not only begin to look predictable , but utterly implausible too . 

of course , film never tried to explain why the country that lacks resources to support its present population happens to spend bucketloads of money on ultra-expensive supertechnology with sole intention of keeping alive most useless and dangerous members of the society . 

the initially interesting plot is done even more wrong by stereotyped characters , played by not too interested or talented actors . 

lori laughlin , although physically attractive , shows the acting ability of sequoia . 

kurtwood smith as prison warden is rather uninspired , capable of solid , yet forgettable performance . 

lambert's performance is also good , but even the bigger talent couldn't help this film , destined to end in oblivion . 
"
"probably the most popular and praised film of all time , turned out to be a primitive and predictable costume drama with a dose of social criticism . 

everyone knows about the greatest and most famous shipping disaster of all time . 

and the actual catastrophe is masterfully crafted by director james cameron , combining visual -and sound effects , he re-creates the frightening atmosphere of the sinking ship in the middle of nowhere . 

i liked very much the emotional and brutal contrast between the first and the third classes . 

while their cabin is slowly filling up with water , a mother is telling her children a fairytail -- "" . . and 

they lived happily ever after . . "" . 

and then the ship goes down and the few survivors are left alone under the stars and the chilling air . 

however , the actual disaster is happening almost at the end of the movie , while the first two hours are just beautiful sets and bad dialogues . 

in the present day , the rms titanic is explored by brock lovett ( bill paxton ) , a treasure seeker looking for the coeur de la mer diamond , lost during the sinking . 

somewhere inside the ship , lovett's crew discover a sketchbook of an artist long dead . 

here , in the shape of a nude young lady , is a window into the distant age of 1912 . 

lovett is extremely surprised when he get's a phone call from rose dawson , claiming that she is a model . 

she is immediately helicoptered onto the vessel , and she gets the first glimpse of the fated ship in 80 years . 

as the memories come flooding back , she once again becomes rose dewitt buketer ( kate winslet ) , the fianc ? e of wealthy cal hockley ( billy zane ) and daughter of ruth dewitt bukater ( frances fisher ) . 

on board there are rich and poor , everyone trust in the ship's designer ( jonathan hyde ) and her master , captain e . j . 

smith ( bernard hill ) . 

on board the ship , rose , unhappy and restless meets jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) - a young american artist , poor , brave and attractive . 

a love story slowly emerges and the two lovers must not only experience the difference between the social classes , but also face the greatest power on earth - death . 

cameron could as well have called his picture "" the never ending love "" or "" love at first sight "" , as he concentrates all his energy on the young couple , and not on the disaster itself . 

the plot is anything but original and the dialogues sometimes resemble a television soap-opera . 

the director doesn't even try to overcome his empty script . 

because of its primitive and predictable plot , titanic is totally depending on the visuals that truly are breathtaking . 

russel carpenter's rich , majestic and incredibly detailed cinematography is certainly award-worthy . 

everything from art direction to visual and sound effects are a top notch . 

but it doesn't help much when the costumes are more convincing than the actors who wear them . 

the actors are not to blame , because their characters are more like caricatures , in other words - fake . 

jack is a man with many talents : he is a talented artist , handsome , brave , honest , strong , funny . . . you 

name it . 

he doesn't have any dark side , he doesn't make any mistakes , that for a second would make him human . 

jack is perfect , but he is - poor . 

on the other hand we have cal . 

he is a bastard that treats rose as an odalisque and not as his wife-to-be . 

he lacks everything jack possesses , but he is -- rich . 

this childish contrast between the social classes is one of those things that makes titanic nothing more than a mediocre picture . 

cameron knows precisely what we want to see . 

his film therefore contains certain minimums to draw an audience - attractive actors , a "" tragic love story "" , beautiful visuals ( including expensive special effects ) , a dose of social criticism , a fascinating historical event ( we love true stories ) and last , but not least - an incredible media support , which proclaimed an average picture the "" greatest film of all time "" . 

on the outside titanic looks perfect , but behind that sparkling curtain of incredible visuals - is emptiness - nothing to think about . 

the main weakness of this film , which ironically became its success , is simplicity . 

cameron enables our basic and if you wish - primitive emotions : love , hate , fear and helplessness . 

everyone understands the power of love and the threat to our beautiful couple is likewise imaginable - a sinking ship . 

titanic is a typical hollywood production , totally and completely dependent on visual perfection to hide its primitive plot . 

it's a good picture , but absolutely not a masterpiece . 

it's among hundreds and thousands good films released every year , not better or worse than the average american film .

"arye cross and courteney cox star as a pair of bostonians who meet in a bar , go to the movies , fall in love , move in together , etc . 

review ====== 

well , if you haven't seen when harry met sally or he said , she said , or if you don't watch love & war on television , you might think this is the most inventive film to come along in ages . 

however , if you've seen any of these , than you have seen most of this film . 

this of course doesn't mean its bad . 

some of it is amusing , but overall , i just had to ask what's the point ? 

arye cross is the stereotypical single male who falls in love . 

kevin pollack is the stereotypical female-fearing best friend who make a lot of rather sexist and vulgar jokes , most if which weren't very funny . 

couteney cox is the stereotypical career-minded woman who falls in love . 

julie brown is the stereotypical bizarre best friend of said woman . 

 ( notice the frequent use of the word stereotypical . 

this film uses a lot of formula , the plot is basically known from the opening credits . ) 

so what is good about the movie ? 

well as i said there are a few amusing moments . 

surprisingly , julie brown , who i usually find just plain goofy , was the best thing in the film . 

also there are several very funny sequences involving analysis of the human mating ritual . 

gee , this is really short . 

not much to say about the film really . 

it is just kind of there . 

watching it on video might not be a complete waste of time , but i wouldn't recommend hiring a baby sitter or spending a lot of money to see it at the theatre .

"in "" twilight , "" a ex-alcoholic , ex-cop , ex-husband , ex-private-eye , harry ross ( paul newman ) , works for a pair of aging hollywood actors , catherine ( susan sarandon ) and jack ames ( gene hackman ) . 

jack is being blackmailed , and he asks harry to deliver the payoff . 

instead of the blackmailers , harry finds a dying ex-cop ( m . 

emmet walsh ) . 

as more bodies begin to pile up , harry realizes that he will have to solve the disappearance of catherine's first husband twenty years earlier to find out who's willing to kill to keep that secret buried . 

newman . sarandon . 

hackman . 

with an a-list cast of oscar laureates like that , "" twilight "" would seem very promising . 

however , the script is tired and predictable . 

it would serve well as a tv-movie-of-the-week , possibly with some 1970's detective hero reprising his role . 

the appeal of the project for its stars and its director , robert benton , is nostalgia . 

 "" twilight "" wants very much to be a 1940's film noir with alan ladd or dick powell . 

all of the standard tropes are here : a hard-boiled p . i . 

among the rich and beautiful whose glamour hides sinister secrets , a femme fatale who tempts and confounds the hero , shadowy figures shooting from doorways , dead bodies confronting the hero at every turn , cops dogging his path and interfering with his investigation . 

the script offers little originality , and co-authors benton and richard russo seem unaware that what was original in 1948 is a clich ? in 1998 . 

elmer bernstein's score is hauntingly melodic and could have been drawn note-for-note from a vintage noir . 

the lead actors try hard-none of the three has every made less than a full effort , even when burdened with a bad script . 

they try to invest every line and gesture with meaning , and they create a convincing sense of the relationships between the main characters . 

harry is fond of jack but is in love with catherine . 

jack is dying of cancer and is jealous of harry's love for catherine . 

catherine teases harry and enjoys his attention , but her real feelings are hidden beneath a carefully-maintained veneer . 

 "" twilight "" wants to be character-driven like "" nobody's fool "" ( also directed by benton , also starring newman , based on a novel by russo ) was , but the tired script gives the actors too little to work with . 

 "" twilight "" also squanders a fine supporting cast : stockard channing ( harry's friend on the police force ) , reese witherspoon ( jack & catherine's bratty kid ) , giancarlo esposito ( the humorous sidekick ) , john spencer ( harry's nemesis on the force ) , liev schreiber and margo martindale ( the blackmailers ) , and james garner ( a cop who bailed movie stars out of trouble ) .

"i don't expect much from eddie murphy these days . 

for the past four years , the gods of cinema--or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates--have allowed him to make one bad movie after another . 

such films as metro , doctor dolittle , holy man , life , and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed-up hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures . 

the biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film , nutty professor ii : the klumps . 

the klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump , an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places . 

sherman has just invented a new "" youth drink "" that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time . 

janet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor ( and for the most ridiculous reasons ) . 

with love on his mind , sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego , buddy love from the first professor , who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers . 

with some convoluted mumbo-jumbo about dna extraction , sherman extracts the "" buddy love "" link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handy-dandy lab beaker . 

but one night , the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated . . . 

because every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy . 

then the klump family , all played by eddie murphy , step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex , flabby breasts , a slew of fart and dick jokes , and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes . 

and did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster ? 

the movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world -- with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene . 

pure and simple , the klumps is a failure . 

its script was handled by not one but five screenwriters , and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes . 

any sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process . 

it's more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz , the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade , american pie , have their names stamped to this trash . 

hey guys - quick note - keep this movie off of your resumes . 

the characterization of sherman's family , the klumps , is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of a black family i have ever seen in cinema . 

everyone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough . 

the grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts . 

the father is gruff , is fired from a blue-collar job , is sexually inadequate , and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings . 

the mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone . 

the brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood . 

sherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to . 

but the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy . 

the family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct . 

and you got the feeling that these crass people couldn't act like this all the time . 

the sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt , making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic . 

after a while , their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story . 

its also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker -- who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london -- and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line . 

even the best effects can't seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days . 

now that i think about it , the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make . 

people will be lined up around the block for it . 

the studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of 2002 . 

eddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles , but he'll play every character in the movie . 

i just can't wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself .

"what do you get when you slap together a movie based on a story by the legendary george lucas , directed by virtuoso director steven spielberg , and starring one of the biggest box-office stars in the world , harrison ford ? 

you get one hot-fudge-rockin' good time , that's what you get ! ! ! 

plot : professor/archeologist indiana jones sets out to find the long-lost mystical ark of the covenant before the nazis get their grubby fingers hands on it . 

adventures , snakes , romance and mucho action ensues . 

critique : astounding movie packed with non-stop action , stunts galore , an interesting story line , great one-liners , a solid cast , a catchy musical score , and all the fun and adventure that you could squeeze into a two-hour thrill ride . 

if you don't enjoy this film , then you just don't like action movies , period ! 

if you're young , you'll enjoy its humor , its cool action sequences and its gross-out factor at times . 

if you're a little older , you'll appreciate the interesting plot line , the romance , and yes , the mountains of adventure . 

watching this movie made me feel like a kid again , dreaming and fantasizing about fighting the bad guys , travelling to different countries , making the impossible , possible ! 

harrison ford is perfect as the every-man with the brains of a scientist and the brawn of an outdoors adventurer , and spielberg manages to achieve the ideal balance of action , fun , adventure and humor . 

now if you really want to have a good time , check into this movie on the same night as its two sequels , rent a jug of iced coke , truckloads of nachos and salsa , an adventure hat and whip , and prepare to gag yourself into a world of action-movie heaven ! 

little known facts about this film and its stars : this picture was nominated for eight 1981 oscar nominations , including best picture . 

it lost that award to chariots of fire , but did manage to win for best art direction , best special effects , best film editing and best sound . 

actor tom selleck was originally cast as indiana jones , but was committed to his hit tv show , "" magnum p . i . "" . 

in filming the well of souls sequence , the producers scoured every pet shop in london and the south of england for every snake they could lay their hands on . 

hence there are snakes that are identifiable from many different geographical areas . 

however , once all the snakes were on set , it became clear that there were not nearly enough of them , so spielberg had several hoses cut into lengths , and these were used as well . 

looking closely , you can tell which are the real snakes and which are not . 

an early draft of the script had indy travelling to shanghai to recover a piece of the staff of ra . 

during his escape from the museum where it was housed , he sheltered from machine gun fire behind a giant rolling gong . 

also in the same script , indy and marion flee the chaos caused by the opening of the ark in a wild mine-cart chase sequence . 

both of these scenes were cut from the script , but ended up in 1984's indiana jones and the temple of doom . 

this film begins with a shot of a peak in the jungle which is reminiscent of the paramount pictures logo . 

the same type of opening is present in its sequels . 

jock's airplane at the beginning of the film has the registration number "" ob-cpo "" . 

this is a reference to obi-wan and c-3po from george lucas' star wars ( 9 . 5/10 ) . 

also , the hieroglyphics in the well of souls include engravings of r2-d2 and c-3po . 

they can be seen on a post to the right of indy and sallah as they remove the ark . 

the script originally included a long fight between a swordsman and indiana with his whip . 

as legend has it , actor harrison ford was suffering diarrhea at the time , and asked if the scene could be shortened . 

spielberg said the only way he could shorten it was if indy pulled out his gun and just shot the guy . 

the entire crew laughed and that's how it was filmed . 

when indy first falls in the well of souls and is face to face with the cobra , you can see the snake's reflection on the glass dividing it and harrison ford , also some fingerprints and stuff like that . 

when indy is dragging along the ground , hanging onto the nazi soldier's truck with the ark inside , you can see the pad that he's being dragged on .

"i tried hard not like this movie without succeeding . 

it contains parts of bringing up baby , any hepburn/tracy film , part of the plot of war games , cary grant and rosalind russell in his girl friday , elevator shaft action , train action , and murder . 

it is cute , funny , suspenseful ( a little bit ) , sexy ( a little bit ) . 

one of the bad guys was a surprise . 

the pace is fast enough , there are some "" action "" scenes . 

i think that this is a reasonable family summer movie for families with older kids who have already seen maverick . 

julia roberts and nick nolte are fine separately and together . 

i really identified with the julia roberts character ( wishful thinking , i know ! ) , but i do have better hair ! 

her hair , a very dull dark brown , has no color . 

she could use some highlights . 

they both do fine with their roles : he's a bored columnist with the chicago chronicle and she's a hotshot "" cub "" reporter with the chicago globe . 

they have great fun trying to out scoop each other to solve one case throughout this movie . 

i like the one story focus . 

other actors include charles martin smith as roberts' boss , olympia dukakis as nolte's coworker , nora dunn also with the chronicle , and marsha mason as a congresswoman . 

basically this movie is reasonably fun . 

there is a serious mystery to solve , and i enjoyed following a fun couple solving the mystery . 

it is a pleasant change of pace from movies that take themselves seriously . 

i do give successful comedy high marks .

"with stars like sigourney weaver ( "" alien "" trilogy ) and academy award winner holly hunter ( the piano , raising arizona , etc . ) together in a single hollywood production , one would immediately identify the film as a potential academy award hot shot . 

sadly for copycat , though tightly scripted and nicely plot , is still at heart , a typical hollywood thriller . 

helen ( weaver ) , after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer , darryl ( harry connick jr . ) , has developed a phobia for being outdoors , so to speak . 

incidentally , helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers , which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes . 

a year has passed and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco . 

detective monahan ( hunter ) and getz ( mulroney ) , baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer , seeks the professional help of helen , who , as expected was reluctant at first . 

copycat "" borrows "" a lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases , it did work . 

but copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability , this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also . . . 

much of the time wasted could've been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama . 

even so , weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments . . . 

weaver being the vulnerable yet strong-within character ( as in aliens ) and hunter being the short , tough , texan speaking cop ( as in raising arizona ) . 

harry connick jr . , a very good jazz singer , shines as the imprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter . 

which comes to the moment of judgement ( drum roll please . . . ) . 

copycat is a good thriller . 

although the plot is highly predictable and one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about 45 minutes into the show , copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats , in anticipation of the killers next immediate move . 

this worked pretty well and will offer audiences a couple of unexpected jolts . 

nice movie to bring your girlfriend to . . . .

"pitch black is a sheep in wolf's clothing . 

it is full of darkness , danger and violence and if you buy into the marketing hype , an unsettling and scary film going experience . 

don't be fooled . 

pitch black is a morality play masquerading as a scare-fest . 

it starts off with blistering intensity . 

a cargo spaceship crash lands on a planet apparently leeched of life by the scorching heat of three suns . 

among the survivors is fry ( mitchell ) , the ship's pilot , who spends the film wrestling with the fact that she tried to jettison the other passengers in her effort to land the craft safely . 

there is imam ( david ) , an islamic leader whose faith in his god is tested repeatedly throughout the film . 

there is a law enforcement officer in the form of johns ( hauser ) , who attacks every situation with square jawed authoritarian zeal . 

and there is riddick ( diesel ) , a menacing , muscle-bound convicted murderer who's being brought back to justice by johns . 

the group quickly sizes up the situation and each other . 

confident in their assessment of matters , a plan is set in motion to escape their hellish environment . 

those plans are shredded by the appearance of one of the planet's wildlife , a predatory , sometimes winged , species that enjoys the taste of blood and flesh . 

fortunately , the creatures are light sensitive and are forced to live in networks of catacombs under the planet's surface . 

unfortunately , the group has managed to land on the planet moments before an eclipse is about to occur , taking away their one protection from the monsters . 

the group's savior comes in the form of johns , whose decisive leadership looks to deliver them from purgatory . 

or does it ? 

pitch black deviates from the standard sci-fi fare by avoiding some of the stock "" escape the boogieman "" conflicts the genre typically serves up . 

just as the planet gave a false facade of lifelessness , first appearances given by the survivors proves to be just as false . 

the excitement of the film comes not from the danger posed by the creatures , but rather from watching the shifting allegiances and emotional growth of the characters as the planet serves as a deus ex machina of sorts to catalyze emotional growth . 

a recurrent theme runs throughout the movie of faith , whether it be religious or in a person , and how that powers their motivations . 

i found it telling that an accidental death occurs early on due to the misperception of a self professed atheist . 

conversely , imam constantly contributes any good fortune to allah . 

one by one , his perceived heaven sent blessings are taken away and crushed . 

imam is forced to reassess his faith . 

another character expresses belief in god , along with a life long hate . 

yet another character makes a decision that echoes the sentiments of christ about selflessness and has lasting repercussions for several of group . 

it is a fascinating character study hiding under the guise of a scare flick . 

special mention should be made of vin diesel , who intriguingly conveys feral menace combined with a truly mesmerizing presence . 

his character could have easily slipped into a parody of the baddass killing machine , but twohy and diesel add surprising depth to riddick . 

they can be excused for the two or three shwarzenegger-like catch phrases that growl their way out of diesel's mouth . 

the movie has its flaws that can be nitpicked . 

the creatures do look derivative of the ones in alien . 

the dialogue isn't the freshest at times , reminiscent of a bad comic book . 

yes , the appearance of riddick's vision skills are more than a little timely considering the situation . 

these trappings are on the periphery of the story twohy is really trying to tell . 

twohy may have lured you in under the pretense of scaring you with film fabricated boogieman , but he shows the real boogieman to be the prejudices and beliefs we use to direct decisions in our lives .

"trees lounge is the directoral debut from one of my favorite actors , steve buscemi . 

he gave memorable performences in in the soup , fargo , and reservoir dogs . 

now he tries his hand at writing , directing and acting all in the same flick . 

the movie starts out awfully slow with tommy ( buscemi ) hanging around a local bar the "" trees lounge "" and him pestering his brother . 

it's obvious he a loser . 

but as he says "" it's better i'm a loser and know i am , then being a loser and not thinking i am . "" 

well put . 

the story starts to take off when his uncle dies , and tommy , not having a job , decides to drive an ice cream truck . 

well , the movie starts to pick up with him finding a love interest in a 17 year old girl named debbie ( chloe sevigny ) and . . . 

i liked this movie alot even though it did not reach my expectation .

"the ads make "" hanging up "" seem like an upbeat comedy about a rascally father and his three daughters . 

anyone who went to the movie expecting that left disappointed . 

all of the movie's funny scenes were included in the ad . 

so what do we get ? 

eve marks ( meg ryan ) just put her father lou mozell ( walter matthau ) into a hospital . 

once upon a time , lou was a hollywood screenwriter who collaborated with his now-estranged wife . 

his one great moment in life was writing a film for john wayne , who gave him a giant bullet-shaped trophy . 

now lou is senile and deteriorating rapidly . 

eve tries to convince her sisters georgia ( diane keaton ) and maddy ( lisa kudrow ) that their father is dying and needs them . 

both are slow to show concern . 

so devoted eve stands vigil over her father , who constantly asks for his favorite daughter georgia , while running her own business ( planning special events ) and caring for her son ( jesse james ) . 

 ( some comic relief comes when maddy also drops off her ailing st . bernard for eve to care for . ) 

the tension builds until all three sisters are finally in one room at one of eve's events where georgia is the keynote speaker . 

there's a superficial resemblance to shakespeare's "" king lear "" ( senile king with three daughters : one devoted saint and two selfish bitches ) , but the material is apparently drawn from life . 

sister screenwriters delia and nora ephron had parents who were a successful hollywood writing team . 

henry and phoebe ephron collaborated on 17 screenplays , including "" desk set "" and "" there's no business like show business . "" 

 ( delia's novel , the basis for the film , is dedicated to henry ) . 

surprisingly , the script is as thin as an anorexic's wet dream . 

the virtue of a semi-autobiographical project would seem to be the wealth of material available . 

yet , the ephrons provide only the barest minimum of information about their characters . 

also , the spaces they inhabit seem artificial . 

eve lives in a house that looks like a magazine layout ; no matter how put-upon she is , we can't feel sorry for anyone whose house is so pristine on any given day . 

georgia is a famous magazine editor , and in her brief scenes while she chats on a cell phone with eve seem like the photo spread for a profile . 

when we first meet maddy , she's fishing at a picturesque mountain stream . 

i expected to see the credit "" cinematography by 'vanity fair . ' "" 

and , yes , diane keaton is literally old enough to be lisa kudrow's mother . 

to her credit , though , she looks young enough to pull it off . 

the one redeeming aspect of "" hanging up "" is that , at its core , is a truth about siblings . 

there's always one on which everyone else in the family relies , freeing the others to be selfish and emotionally distant . 

my wife is the reliable child in her family ; for better or worse , my brother has the role in mine . 

 ( being selfish and emotionally distant may not be fulfilling , but it is a lot less work ) . 

if you have nothing better to do than watch this movie , look for a powerful cameo by cloris leachman as the sisters' mother pat . 

in a devastating scene , eve discovers that her mother doesn't love her . 

although leachman is best known for comedies like "" young frankenstein "" and "" the mary tyler moore show , "" her performance here reminded me of the considerable dramatic talent she displayed in "" the last picture show . "" 

bottom line : everyone involved has lived in hollywood so long they don't recognize real life anymore .

"deserves recognition for : achieving the near-impossible task of making a grander monument to self-love than steven seagal's on deadly ground . 

capsule review : a question : after the floating baby ruth that was waterworld , what in the @$&% were the hollywood execs who gave kevin costner the money to make another post-apocalyptic movie thinking ? 

in this 3 hour advertisement for his new hair weave , costner plays a nameless drifter who dons a long dead postal employee's uniform and gradually turns a nuked-out usa into an idealized hippy-dippy society . 

 ( judging by the costuming at the end of the movie , the main accomplishment of this brave new world is in re-inventing polyester . ) 

when he's not pointing the camera directly at himself , director costner does have a nice visual sense , and it is undeniably fascinating to see such an unabashedly jingoistic film in the trust-no-one 90's ; but by the time the second hour rolled around , i was reduced to sitting on my hands to keep from clawing out my own eyes .

"eric rohmer's "" pauline at the beach , "" is one of those small , deliberately paced , but charming foreign films in which not much happens plot wise , but a lot happens to the characters emotionally . 

the film takes place during a few weeks of august at the normandy coast , and centers on six different characters , primarily pauline ( amanda langlet ) , a wise beyond her years 15-year-old who has come to stay for the summer with her older cousin , marion ( arielle dombasle ) . 

on the first day at the beach , marion runs into an old high school flame ( fedoore atkine ) , and although he wants to rekindle their relationship , she is more interested in an older , more seductive womanizer ( pascal greggory ) , who is also secretly having an affair with a candy vendor ( rosette ) . 

while pauline watches as an outsider at what is happening between all of the adults , she forms a relationship of her own with a young teenage boy ( simon de la brosse ) . 

 "" pauline at the beach , "" is not a film in which big dramatic things occur , and there is not a clear-cut , tidy conclusion to the story . 

instead , it is a picture that simply observes its characters in every day life , and the surprises come from little character details . the film is quite talky and slow moving , and so it is pretty safe to say it isn't for those who are only a fan of action movies , but is a treat for those viewers who often like to venture outside of the big-budget genre and see a good art film . 

this is the first film by acclaimed director eric rohmer ( 1969's "" my night at mauds , "" and 1971's "" claire's knee "" ) that i have seen , but his direction is assured and intelligent , as is the screenplay , which he also wrote . 

 "" pauline at the beach , "" is a film worth seeing .

"there should be a requirement that a potential viewer be under a certain film iq in order to see "" mission to mars . "" 

there are probably quite a few people who are going to enjoy it , and most of them will probably be those who have seen very few films of its kind . 

but there are those who will not , and those will most likely be people who have already seen one or more of the following movies : "" 2001 : a space odyssey , "" "" armageddon , "" "" apollo 13 , "" "" the abyss , "" "" close encounters of the third kind , "" "" e . t . 

the extra-terrestrial , "" "" alien , "" and "" aliens . "" 

why ? 

because there is not one original idea in "" mission to mars . "" 

all of it is cribbed from other films ( and in most cases , better films ) . 

if this is the sort of thing you don't mind , you might like the film . 

of course , there are other reasons not to like "" mission to mars , "" the main one being a script written by people who seem to assume their audience is filled with people who haven't used their brains in some time , and who don't intend to start during the film's running time . 

 "" mission to mars "" manages to be both stupid and boring at the same time . 

the plot , cribbed greatly from "" 2001 , "" concerns a team sent to mars , the first manned trip ever made to the red planet . 

luke graham ( don cheadle ) leads the team , jointly formed of americans and russians . 

the team encounters a mysterious monolith that emits a strange pulse ( this being nothing like the pulse-emitting monolith in "" 2001 "" -- that one was on the * moon * ) , but when they try to study it , a giant sand tornado comes out of the top and swallows them ( all except luke , who survives long enough to send a garbled message back to the rotating space station , which looks strangely like the rotating space station in "" 2001 "" ) . 

a rescue mission is planned with husband & wife team woody blake ( tim robbins ) and terri fisher ( connie nielsen ) , obligatory pilot with a troubled past jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , and extra crew member phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) along for the ride . 

after some zero-gravity dancing , they run into problems when one of their engines is blown , forcing them to attempt a desperate landing aboard a supply vessel . 

now stranded on mars with minimal supplies , the team must decide whether or not it can risk entering the monolith or if they should return home . 

after all , that monolith just might contain information about how life originated on earth . 

 "" mission to mars "" is one of those films that makes a critic wonder where to start when talking about all the things that are wrong with it , so let's start with one of the things that does work : director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in a few scenes during the middle of the film . 

that's it . 

everything else fails . 

the failure isn't de palma's fault ; he's working from an atrocious script . 

only during the sequence aboard the ship ( looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in "" 2001 "" ) where the rescue team's air begins running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch it up does "" mission to mars "" come to life . 

a scene where they attempt to save a comrade floating away into space also provides some tension , until you realize that the entire danger/more danger/attempted rescue sequence has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film ; it's just a contrived way to generate thrilling scenes . 

take it out , and the plot isn't affected in any way . 

the sequence also suffers from a few plot holes ( as does the rest of the film ) : why is the ship's computer ( which sounds strangely like hal from , uh , "" 2001 "" ) able to detect a hole in the main chamber but not one in the engine ? 

why did tim robbins' character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside ? 

shouldn't the astronauts be better trained to deal with a hull breach ? 

why are the characters such idiots ? 

because the script makes little attempt to properly develop them . 

all the "" conflict "" is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene ( which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shot ) during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know : "" jim , it's too bad you can't go on this mission because you were determined 'psychologically inadequate' because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together "" -- does anyone really talk like this ? 

can't we find out these things in a less grating matter , like maybe in a flashback ? 

the whole film is like that . 

the filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know what's going on ; they must * tell * us exactly what we're looking at * every * time . 

sample dialogue from the film : ( shot of mars ) astronaut a : "" look , there's mars "" astronaut b : "" you sure that's mars ? "" 

astronaut a : "" yeah , that's mars all right . "" 

astronaut c : "" hey , are you guys looking at mars ? "" 

that exchange isn't actually in "" mission to mars , "" but i wouldn't be surprised if it were . 

for all their cribbing from kubrick , spielberg , james cameron , and even ron howard , the makers of this film haven't learned to do something all those directors did very well : show and don't tell . 

de palma used to know how , but seems to have forgotten . 

this is mentally-challenged filmmaking ; they assume the audience won't get what's going on , so they explain everything five times over . 

fourth-graders may appreciate this , but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted . 

the principal actors sleepwalk their way through "" mission to mars , "" never managing to do away with an apparent "" i'm just here to get a paycheck "" attitude . 

cheadle stumbles over his awkward lines . 

armin mueller-stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo . 

robbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard "" decent guy "" performance . 

and sinise hams it up with "" wistful "" facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife ( played by kim delaney , who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavy-handed monologue about the meaning of life ) , and especially during the stolen-from-no-less-than-three-movies ( a lollipop to whoever names them ) conclusion , which combines endless , obvious explanation and sub-par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then . 

and of course , these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in "" 2001 "" who facilitated the evolution of life on earth ; those aliens were from an * unknown * world . 

it could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy "" mission to mars , "" but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow-going . 

leisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it , but all of the substance of "" mission to mars "" has been stolen from other films , and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters . 

supposedly we're intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one ( totally different from the one-character-decides-not-to-return ending of "" armageddon "" ) , but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning . 

me , i alternated between the two . 

there is only one good thing about the way "" mission to mars "" finally ends : the fact that the movie is over .

"bruce lee was a bigger-than-life martial artist ( and ) actor . 

bruce's unique character ( i . e . , self-produced sound effects , etc . ) and seemingly perfected martial art and physique were all well portrayed by the actor , james lee . 

the story is told from his wife linda's point of view where she put a lot of family and practical side of bruce lee's life . 

however , you can't help but like , whenever the fight scenes are on , what he can does with his body and that familiar bruce attitude and character . 

i also like the little bits of insight scenes about bruce lee's life before he became famous : scenes like bruce practicing pronunciation of english . 

it seemed as if he was no better than anybody else . 

scenes like bruce delivering chinese food as a delivery boy ridding a bike through the american college looking at the ( all-white ) students , cheerleaders , and athletes . 

it seemed he too wished for the american dreams and hopes . 

in conclusion , the movie was well made , it produced a realization of who bruce lee was , and actor james lee was so much like bruce you have to remind yourself that he is just an actor . 

and the fighting scenes were all excellent . 

so go see it and enjoy the movie . 

p . s . if you have seen the movie unforgiven by clint eastwood , then the feeling left after dragon was very much like the feeling you got after the unforgiven .

"i should have known , damn it , i should have known . 

ewan mcgregor - codename : "" eye "" - is pointing a high-tech rifle-ly gadget at a fat , bald business-oriented american engaging in illicit sexual activities in a window across the street . 

we get the requisite electro-green through-the-sight view . 

we the audience , seeing a high tech rifle-ly gadget , of course think that eye is going to assassinate the target , but instead , he pulls the trigger and the rifle takes twenty or so hazy , low-quality photographs , which eye then proceeds to fax and e-mail to everyone in his target's office . 

all right , so thirty seconds in , i was slightly befuddled by this seemingly pointless rifle/camera , but i was still open minded . . . 

maybe there's a really good reason for it . 

i've got reason to believe , you see - i admire a lot of ewan mcgregor's previous work . . . 

and he's obi wan ke- friggin-nobi for god's sake . 

and director stephan elliot's last movie priscilla , queen of the desert was a quirky little delight . 

there's some genuine talent involved here . 

i think at the twenty minute mark , there was still a spark of hope in my heart . 

eye has been assigned to investigate the leader of his organization's son ( i still have no idea what this organization was - british intelligence ? 

national spy ring ? 

private investigation ? ) , who is apparently stealing from his trust fund . 

he has received his assignment from k . d . 

lang , through an elaborate and expensive teleconferencing briefcase . 

when eye tracks his target to an expensive- looking secluded house , he witnesses a mysterious and beautiful woman ( ashley judd ) take a knife out and proceed to stab the poor bastard . 

ok , that's odd , i think to myself , this could be interesting . 

then she starts to cry , and through her tears exclaims "" merry christmas , dad ! "" 

for the first time . 

so begins our tale of obsession . . . 

or . . . something . 

the rest of the movie involves ewan mcgregor's eye character following ashley judd around to every corner of the united states , totally and completely obsessed by this woman from afar . 

throughout his entire professional life , he has been a voyeur ; so when he falls for someone , the only way he can handle it is to watch and drool through telescopes and cameras . 

fine , that's a lovely premise , i suppose . 

but gosh darn it , if you're going to go there , you better have some sort of explanation . 

and that's precisely where this film fails . 

this is the kind of movie that pisses me off . 

it's an abortion , a collection of half-formed and wasted ideas that amounts to absolutely nothing in the end . 

it pretends it is something that it is not - a surreal and deep psychological character study wrapped in a high-tech thriller . 

here , the filmmakers have confused "" surreal "" and "" deep "" with "" vaguely unclear "" and "" crammed full of insultingly obvious metaphors . "" 

i never , even for an instant , had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in "" love "" with this woman who changes wigs and kills people . 

the movie offers only two explanations , neither of which make a lick of sense . 

explanation number one : the obnoxious presence of eye's imaginary daughter , who was taken away from him by his wife some time ago , tells him he shouldn't leave ms . judd . 

explanation two , which by the end of the film has been beaten into our heads through imagery and dialog and even the title of the movie : "" beauty is in the eye of the beholder . "" 

whoo hoo , that helps , thanks a bunch , case closed . 

that's as deep as it gets , folks . 

there is an attempt at an explanation in the final minutes , which , instead of tying everything together , ends up being as profound as a clever sixth-grade mad lib . 

there are secondary characters that move in and out of the picture and serve little or no purpose except to make the audience wonder what the hell the point was . 

my personal favorites include : the prison-matron modeled after austin powers' frau farbissina , who apparently taught ms . judd everything she knows about wearing wigs ; jason priestley's awfully played dirty desert vagrant #1 , who tries to emulate dennis hopper a la blue velvet , but fails miserably ; and the cop-who-sees-ashley-fleeing-an-accident-scene-and- then-wants-to-pay-for-sex- but-is-shot . 

each one in this sad little parade is a little more pointless than the last . 

the script pays no attention to the laws of time and space . 

any time one of the frequent location changes occurs , the camera zooms in on a souvenir snow globe , and minutes , weeks , or years could have passed . 

bewilderingly inane stylistic decisions plague the whole affair - one character passes a glass of cognac to another in a slow-motion close-up awash in a lot of bass . 

ewan mcgregor at one point takes up residence in a bell tower just so he could be repeatedly awakened and deafened by the giant bell . 

jason priestly starts philosophizing about sharks , then laughs maniacally . . . 

cut to random guy with eye patch . . . 

iguana out of focus . . . 

iguana comes into focus . 

wow , man . 

when i found out afterward that this film was based on a novel , it came as no surprise to me . 

there are plenty of elements here that , if extended and fleshed out more , would have made for a decent story . 

and i wouldn't be surprised if i found out there was an hour and a half of footage cut from this movie lying in a landfill somewhere , or waiting in the wings for the dvd special director's cut . . . 

not that anything would ever possess me to purchase such a thing to find out what i was missing . 

the last ten or so minutes featured a conversation between the eye and the judd that was supposed to be some sort of revealing exposition . 

some guy in the back of the theater was talking on his cell phone , and this time i didn't particularly care all that much because what was happening on the screen was a steaming pile of unholy crap ; the audience around me chuckled and whispered sentiments similar to what i was thinking . 

someone near cell-phone-guy did eventually yell , "" shut the hell up ! "" , but it was a lot funnier when we thought he was talking to the screen .

"darren ( jason biggs ) , wayne ( steve zahn ) , and j . d . ( jack black ) have been best friends since the fifth grade . 

like the three musketeers , they've been together through thick and thin . 

but , when darren meets an attractive , but cold-blooded and manipulative , psychiatrist , judith ( amanda peet ) , the long time friendship is placed in danger . 

it's up to wayne and j . d . to rescue their best friend in "" saving silverman . "" 

 "" silverman "" has its heart in the right place , but the story , by newcomers hank nelken and greg depaul , is too lightweight to sustain the tale of the battle for darren's soul . 

based on their experience of a friend making a major marital mistake , the story is centered on the three , life long amigos . 

when wayne introduces darren to judith , he doesn't realize that he has opened a pandora's box of disaster for himself and j . d . judith was once in a relationship where her boyfriend was the dominant figure until he died in a kick boxing match . 

since then , she has sought a new mate - someone she can boss around and mold into her own vision . 

enter darren silverman . 

once they realize the magnitude of their error in judgement , wayne and j . d . try everything they can , including threats and bribery , to get judith to free darren . 

nothing works until the duo come up with a plan - kidnap judith and get darren back together with the girl he called his one and only , pretty sandy perkus ( amanda detmer ) . 

the only problem here is that sandy is about to take her vows to become a nun . 

things spiral out of control as judith repeatedly attempts to escape while wayne and j . d . play cupid . 

the boys even bring their idol , neil diamond , into the picture to help resolve things . 

thinking about it , this is a real mishmash of contrivance and coincidence that is held together solely by the comedic efforts of steve zahn and jack black . 

the pair is able to elicit the film's only laughs with their goofy antics and child-like behavior . 

they are relegated to providing slapstick guy humor and the two are more than equal to the task . 

steve zahn has been steadily honing his comedic acting skills and gives some complexity to wayne , the "" brains "" of the gang . 

jack black has the big-guy moves of a chris farley , giving j . d . an amusing physical presence . 

the neat thing is that the two actors are able to get fresh laughs from stale material . 

the rest of the cast doesn't fare as well , though . 

jason biggs is the straight man of the musketeers and gets very little to do ; though having watched his previous films ( "" american pie "" and "" loser "" ) i'm not sure what attraction biggs actually has . 

amanda peet is caustic as the manipulative judith . 

there is no humanity at all to her character as she single-mindedly strives to recreate darren into her mind's image . 

she's a monster that wayne and j . d . must defeat to save their friend . 

unfortunately , there is no dimension to her character . 

amanda detmer brings nothing ( or gets nothing ) as darren's one and only . 

r . lee ermey , as the psychotic coach , made a bad decision taking this role . 

tune-meister neil diamond gives a good-natured cameo perf as the boys' idol and savior . 

production values are on par with the rest of the film - lackluster and non-involving . 

director dennis dugan has a track record for broad comedy with films like "" big daddy "" and "" beverly hills ninja , "" but falls flat with "" saving silverman . "" 

the 2001 movie year has yet to provide us with a "" good "" film to sink our teeth into . 

at least , with "" saving silverman , "" we get a couple of funny perfs from zahn and black . 

too bad that the rest of the film lacks their level of humor . 

kick boxing deaths and conflicted nuns are not the makings of a good comedy . 

i give it a c- . 
"
"with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink , the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories : quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the "" film noir "" genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control ( fargo , miller's crossing , blood simple ) , and off-the-wall comedies centered around an eccentric , scatter-brained lead character ( raising arizona , the hudsucker proxy ) . 

their latest offering , the big lebowski , falls within the latter category , though there are elements of the crime-gone-wrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film . 

the main difference , however , is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didn't quite have the brains to get it all together , the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who's wise to the world , but he doesn't really want to do much of anything besides go bowling , smoke pot , and generally relax . 

that main character is jeffrey "" the dude "" lebowski ( jeff bridges ) , introduced by the film's rambling narrator ( sam elliott ) as "" quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county . "" 

the dude is unemployed , needless to say , and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends , walter ( john goodman ) , a borderline-psychotic who's in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebody's cheating in a bowling match ( "" has the whole world gone crazy ? ! "" he shouts at a suspected cheater ) , and donny ( steve buscemi ) , who's always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it ( "" donny , you have no frame of reference here ! "" ) . 

these three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments , and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , who , when we first meet him , is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of "" hotel california "" and , if it's possible , seems to be even more of a head case than walter . 

if that doesn't give you a good idea of this film's absurdist tone , then perhaps this will : the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude's rug . 

they've mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the "" big "" lebowski ( david huddleston ) and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny ( tara reid ) owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) . 

the dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug ; he doesn't have any luck , but when bunny is apparently kidnapped , the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the $1 million ransom . 

unfortunately , walter gets involved and fouls up the drop-off , and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers , the dude's car gets stolen , along with the briefcase containing the money . 

soon , the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by a group of german "" nihilists "" who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place ; the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn . 

meanwhile , the big lebowski's daughter maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist avant-garde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked , wants to recover the money for her family . 

the plot , however , is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc . 

the previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival's "" run through the jungle , "" and it fits : the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases , with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble ( usually unsuccessfully ) . 

the film doesn't feature quite as many one-liners and sight gags as the coens' other comedies ( though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor , particularly in the dude's dream sequences and acid flashbacks ) , but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact . 

the film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result - you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this "" jungle "" but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations - but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution . 

there's also a noticeable ( but not too heavy-handed ) thread of social commentary in the big lebowski , which , incidentally , takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin ; at the beginning , we see george bush on television making his "" this aggression will not stand "" speech . 

the coens take aim at just about every elite l . a . subculture in the book : the egotistical wealthy businessman ( "" the bums will always lose ! "" 

shouts the big lebowski at one point ) , the porn industry , the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their "" peaceful beach community , "" and so on . 

by the end , we really start to admire the dude , who almost certainly harbors the least "" aggression "" of anyone in this story ; his passive resistance ( emphasis on "" passive , "" albeit ) to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters . 

he also turns out to have a pretty well-functioning brain in his head , even if he doesn't like to use it very much ; his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when he's getting a run around , and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end . 

the coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness , but they don't just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either . 

i think that , more than anything , is what makes the big lebowski a standout comedy : it manages to approach characters like the dude and , to some extent , walter , with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatter-brained . 

audience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the un-dynamic duo by the end of the movie , given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first . 

 "" it's good knowin' he's out there , the dude , takin' it easy , "" posits the narrator towards the end . 

i dare say that truer words have seldom been spoken . 
"
"i didn't hate the big hit , even though it is a stupefyingly terrible film . 

for the entirety of its running time , my eyes were attached to the screen , and i never once got bored . 

i found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness : this is such a confused disaster of a film that it's entertaining to watch it in the same way that it's entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl . 

as a narrative , the big hit is pure garbage , never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries . 

it reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank , which is a similar film that fails in a lot of the same ways . 

it's fine to mix genres , if the film makers know what they're doing . 

unfortunately , writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong don't seem to know how to handle the material , and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy . 

the biggest problem with the amalgamation , in this case , is that the film is absurd and the comedy is out of place . 

but it sure is a fascinating failure . 

marky . 

 . 

 . 

er , mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley , a hitman . 

he's a good hitman , apparently , although his tactics seem a bit rambunctious ( he doesn't snipe or make clean kills--he just kicks the door down and shoots everything ) . 

he works with a few other hitmen--cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) , crunch ( bokeem woodbine ) , and vinnie ( antonio sabbato , jr . ) . 

they're a nice bunch of muscular guys , who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex . 

they all work for a man named paris ( avery brooks ) , who is rich , powerful , and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen . 

it is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own ; this , of course , is where the plot comes in . 

they decide to kidnap a young japanese girl named keiko ( china chow ) , who has a rich father . 

when they do this , it turns out she is paris' . 

 . 

 . 

goddaughter ! 

it's very bad to have paris against you . 

the story is standard action film stuff . 

it's nothing new , and nothing particularly offensive ( but certainly not the slightest bit compelling ) . 

clearly the major selling point of the big hit is that it's a john woo-type of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy . 

it's true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea ( such as face/off and the replacement killers , which are both far superior ) . 

there are stunts that are fun to watch : the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story . 

they use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns . 

melvin is also very good at breakdancing , and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives . 

like i said , it's not boring ; most disasters aren't . 

what makes it so bad is its genre-shifting madness . 

it seems to start out as a quirky-but-realistic action comedy , as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains . 

then , as soon as they go to their first hit , it turns into a music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere . 

then , somewhere in between , it turns back into comedy . 

keiko turns out to be a spunky little girl ; in one amusing scene , she is forced to read a letter out loud , indicating that she has been kidnapped , but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words . 

and scenes like this work alone , but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious , or not be in the film at all . 

one of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped ; when cisco gets there , paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it , but they let him out of there , telling him to find the perpetrator . 

the scene is played for laughs , but it isn't funny . 

and since it doesn't quite work as a comedy , it tries to fall back on the action , which also fails . 

this is a film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with a handgun . 

cars land on tree branches and are supported by them . 

characters betray each other without a second thought . 

grenades are thrown in tight places . 

people jump out of tall buildings and survive . 

people outrun tumbling cars , and get out of the way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds . 

most frustrating of all , though , is the film's definition of a hit man : these guys are anything but subtle , quiet , and skilled individuals . 

they're more like socially depraved militia men ( melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage , including missile launchers and hand-held machineguns ) . 

the characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest ; this obviously doesn't make for deep or interesting people to watch . 

the acting is kind of fun , though--wahlberg is a good actor , and his innocuous presence in this film is charming in a silly sort of way . 

phillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character , while christina applegate , who plays melvin's fianc ? e , is convincingly air-headed . 

the big hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny . 

the funniest parts are supplied by the actors , and not by the numerous failed attempts at sight gags and one-liners . 

it's a true disaster , one that makes me believe that the goofy and unrealistic tone is completely unintentional . 

despite all this , though , i must reiterate the entertainment value here . 

you can cherish the awfulness of a film like this . 

if you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe that it is , you just might enjoy yourself . 
"
"pre-review note : seeing as the only concern of body shots is "" sex "" , i will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review . 

because of this , i will try to vary word descriptions of "" sex "" ( meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms , and \ or your name is jerry falwell , you are kindly invited to hit the x up on the left corner of your screen ) , so if there happens to be a word you come across and cannot comprehend , fret not , it's most likely just another way of referring to "" sex "" . 

i think we'd all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review . 

though not as boring as the movie which makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god knows what . 

body shots is a film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously , in the way you'd normally expect to see a violent attack . 

it's about people who think about screwing , seek it out , and talk about it . 

these are things we all do , sometimes . 

the characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts . 

their lives center around the next sexual encounter , but they seemed depressed . 

it's as if fucking is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek . 

at its core body shots is a message movie , the kind of thing i could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition . 

michael cristoffer ( who directed gia , another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil ) is a moralist with nothing new to say . 

his characters don't communicate anything of interest to each other , so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera . 

they voice simplistic platitudes like "" i like to come "" or "" sex without love equals violence "" . 

huh ? 

and yes that is as complex as this movie's observations get . 

the characters are stupid and shallow , with not one registering as anything more . 

the plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure , then the after math ( the morning after ) of such events . 

we meet the characters as they speak directly to us , confiding in us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy . 

i would normally go into the characters and the actors who play them , giving you the pros and cons , but for this film i cannot . 

i'm not trying to be clever or witty , but i honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others . 

with the exception of trent ( played by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman ) , the rest fade into each other-- a patchwork of fake breasts , defined abs , pearly white teeth , and creamy , flawless skin . 

i vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one , only because his character gets the worst lines ( "" sex without love equals violence "" ) . 

in between all the confessionals , cristoffer films everything like a headache commercial , with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning . 

the fact that this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffles me . 

this film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claims to be defining . 

if body shots is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and f * * k-obsessed , fine , i don't have any problem with a film that tries to persuade me to think a certain way , but cristoffer only gives us one side . 

additionally that one side isn't even entertaining ; the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness . 

or realism . 

one sexual encounter takes place outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters . 

they suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason ( other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other ? ? ? alas , if it could only be that easy ? ? ? kidding of course ) , then , not only isn't it erotic , it isn't real . 

it doesn't feel like an authentic sexual encounter . 

every f * * k scene in this film ( and there are many ) is treated in the same unsexy manner . 

body shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film . 

it shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it , and most of all , it fails to show us why its characters love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it . 

the resulting search for nookie ( and you can take that cookie ? ? ? ) over one night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow . 

the main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred . 

the film shows us two separate versions of the possible rape ( one where it is consensual the other where it is not ) and in both versions the young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off . 

this is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently , and if memory serves me i can't think of one film that has done so , and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80's next to wall street . 

unfortunately nobody gives us reason to care , not the writer , the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off . 

paul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in a manner similar to what cristoffer does here , though boogie nights succeeded . 

it was similarly moralistic , but it gave us two different viewpoints ; it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters , and it showed us the possible fall-out of such a decision . 

the characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here , but anderson seemed to care about them . 

he gave them heart . 

cristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones . 

he preaches to us , by using his characters to preach to us . 

this is not the way to get any message across . 

why not just direct a public service announcement on the perils of hittin' skins ? 

cristofer kind of does that , though without an ounce of insight , and with a helping of leering exploitation . 
"
"everything about this ninth trek movie seems on the cheap , from the roger corman-grade special effects to its highly derivative and ugly ad campaign ( the poster is nearly identical to that of star trek vi : the undiscovered country ) . 

but piller's not-quite-half-baked screenplay should ultimately claim responsibility for insurrection's failure . 

i'm about to give the same advice to rick berman and co . 

as i've given to the financiers of james bond movies : it's time to breathe life into this workhorse by hiring solid genre writers and a real director . 

 ( while we're at it , put that visor back on laforge ! ) 

for three hundred years , the ba'ku species ( who look just like humans ) have lived on a ringed-planet that might as well be called the fountain of youth . 

six hundred of them occupy the briar patch , the area affected by metaphasic radition , a positive energy that reverses the aging process in the elderly . 

but evil ru'afo ( this is probably abraham's last stop before performing "" amadeus "" at a dinner theatre near you ) , leader of the son'a ( who look just like burn victims after reconstructive surgery ) , wants to relocate the ba'ku and movie his people onto the briar patch in their place , in order to replenish his dying breed . 

the federation is all for this , but picard feels this is a direct violation of the prime directive : to not interfere with the development of an alien race . 

 ( never mind that the ba'ku didn't exactly evolve-they went wandering in the universe one day and stumbled upon the magic world . ) 

every time frakes gives an interview lately , he seems to top whatever ludicrous statement he last gave regarding this installment . 

he has called it a comedy , a thinking man's picture , a throwback to the old series , and , most grievously , he has likened it to a john ford western . 

 ( i presume that's some john ford he went to school with , not the director of the searchers . ) 

he has also gone on record as saying paramount recut the film from his version . 

that's no excuse-someone generated this footage . 

muddy cinematography and sitcom sets are the least of its problems ; star trek : insurrection appears to have been beamed in from the planet plotholia . 

consider such curiosities . . . 

picard's love interest , anij ( donna murphy ) , can slow things down by staring at them ( such as a waterfall or falling rocks ) -her scientific explanation for this ? 

 "" don't ask . "" 

worf gets a pimple ( he's re-experiencing klingon puberty thanks to the time-defying atmosphere ) , laforge regains his eyesight ( trust me , levar burton's real eyes are scarier than those electronic lenses he wore in first contact ) and troi brags about her firm boobs , but picard remains as bald as an android's butt . 

most suspiciously , what exactly is the problem with letting this endangered race have a little fun in the sun ? 

the filmmakers cloud the issue with some nonsense about a family feud of sorts , and they also turn ru'afo into a completely power-mad superfreak , just so the characters will have something to do in the climax . 

 ( and if you've seen return of the jedi , you've seen the ending of this movie . ) 

didn't picard himself previously disobey the prime directive when he prevented the borg from assimilating millions ? 

frakes lucked out with first contact , and repeat viewings of that film reveal the seeds of what went wrong in his direction of insurrection : he has no sense of comic timing , and he mines for acting chemistry where none exists . 

 ( take a look at the painful "" troi gets drunk "" scene in fc and you'll get the general idea of insurrection's unsuccessfully jokey and hollow tone . ) 

even the worst shatner and co . 

treks , like the final frontier , maintained a watchability thanks to the effortless , charming comaraderie between kirk , spock , and bones . 

neither first contact nor insurrection has any idea what to do with crusher ( gates mcfadden , whom i must say maintains a fabulous physique ) , troi , or laforge . 

and all three next generation films spend too much time on data , who is the franchise's answer to urkel . 

need a cheap laugh ? 

have data say something sexual , or start singing , or lift up a four hundred pound boulder as if it's the hunk of styrofoam it really is . 

here's my proposed title for number 10 : data star data trek : data data data data data . 

in this movie , data will become preoccupied with learning to blow his nose , while crusher and troi watch silently from 500 yards away and laforge points his sinister gaze at the android in doubly robotic observation . 

star trek : insurrection had one nice , eerie , silent moment that hints at a better , darker film . 

i'm not saying all of them should be star trek ii : the wrath of khan , but this one boldly went where no movie should go again . 
"
"i've got to admit it . . . 

i'm a huge jim carrey fan . 

i loved the first ace ventura , as well as the mask and dumb and dumber--and even in batman forever ( which was a pretty awful movie ) , carrey was one of the few people to come off looking reasonably good . 

until i saw ace ventura 2 , i had no idea how people could find the guy annoying . 

sadly , ace ventura 2 shows just how irritating and annoying carrey can be . 

carrey goes through the same schtick he went through in the first ace movie , but this time it is no longer funny--it is just a rehash of many of the same jokes used in ace i . 

the plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring after failing to save a raccoon ( in a reasonable cliffhanger spoof ) . 

soon he is called out of retirement to find a bat which was kidnapped and , if not returned in four days , will cause two warring african tribes to destroy each other . 

once again , it's up to ace to save the day , using his uncanny detective skills . 

those who have been disappointed by carrey's more restrained roles in the films following the first ace ventura may be glad to see him over-acting to the best of his ability , but some may be disappointed by the fact that this sequel doesn't capture the feel of the original . 

the original benefited from what looked to be carrey's constant hyped-up improv sequences , which were hysterically funny . 

here , however , the tighter script ( which is reminiscent of the old disney telemovies ) takes the improvised material from the first , and shamelessly recycles it in the new movie , giving carrey little chance to improvise . 

instead , his extremely funny manner has been reduced to just walking around stupidly . 

but one of the biggest problems i had was with the character of ventura himself . 

in the first movie , he was always cool , and one step ahead of every one else--perfect for carrey's off-the-wall approach . 

but here , ventura is made to look a lot stupider , and is often made out as the straight guy--a role which is definitely not carrey's style . 

there are definitely some very funny moments , but they are few and far between . 

they are also nowhere near as funny as anything carrey did in the first ace ventura , or even dumb and dumber .

"what's shocking about "" carlito's way "" is how good it is . 

having gotten a bit of a bad rap for not being a big box office hit like pacino's previous film , "" scent of a woman , "" and not having as strong a performance as he did in that one ( he had just won an oscar ) , "" carlito's way "" was destined for underrated heaven . 

that's what it is : an underrated gem of a movie . 

and what a shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing jobs with it , and turn it into a great piece of a pulpy character study . 

 "" carlito's way "" deals with , well , carlito brigante ( pacino ) , a puerto rican ex-drug kingpin , who gets out of a long jailterm when his coke-addicted , curly-haired lawyer ( sean penn ) points out a legal technicality . 

of course , carlito was actually awoken in prison , and has decided to go straight , even if he's really a crook at heart . 

carlito , like barry lyndon , is a man who is trapped by fate at every turn , and can't escape into something he is not . 

carlito's attempts at a clean , legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn . 

when he first gets out , a friend of his ends up leading him into a big shoot-out , where he has to kill a couple people to survive . 

he's constantly getting bugged by the government to see if he's doing anything illegal , and his lawyer finds himself neck-deep in a pile of shit , needing him to try and help him out , which includes him doing some prison breaking . 

carlito , like ratso rizzo , wants to go to miami ( since , according to film logic , that's where it's at ) , but needs some funding . 

being a legend , he is quickly able to get a nice job running a big dance club ( this is the 70s , by the way , and since some of this takes place in night clubs , we get to hear all sorts of 70s classics , including several k . c . 

and the sunshine band tunes - my personal favorite ) . 

he gets a bodyguard ( the great luis guzman , at his best ) , and is soon running a pretty good business , even if he's constantly attracting underworld young thugs , like benny blanco "" from the bronx "" ( john leguiziamo ) , who is more than once pointed out to be a young version of carlito . 

on the other side , the symbol of promise and hope , is gail ( penelope ann miller - what happened to her ? ) , his girlfriend from before prison . 

she's a goregeous ballerina , and a stripper , and soon carlito is trying to get back with her , and take her with him when he finally leaves for miami . 

while this relationship is never fully defined or anything , we get a sense of love between them , and they have some truly interesting scenes between them ( she never gives him addresses or locales - he always has to track her down ) . 

all of these elements clash together at the end , in a brilliantly executed , emotional climax , which is inevitable . 

when i say inevitable , i mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack , putting a great spin on it . 

sure , it's going to eleveate some of the tension , but it gives the film a lot of depth , as carlito is seen trapped by fate . 

what's amazing is the big chase sequence ( amazingly done by de palma ) has a lot of tension and thrills . 

like "" apollo 13 , "" we know what's going to happen , but we're still thrilled by what happens in the middle . 

it's also very emotional , thanks to a great script by david koepp , and amazing performances by pacino and miller . 

de palma is famous ( or infamous ) for lots of violence in his films . 

his earlier flim , "" scarface "" ( which starred pacino in the lead ) , has a ton of it , especially at the end ( and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which i'm still not over ) . 

but de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes . 

to me , the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of a building , looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet . 

this is the most brilliantly done , and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film , and probably the best in de palma film history . 

with a gorgeous soprano duet in the background , and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlito's head , and a saddened , remorseful look on pacino's face , it's a tear-jerker ( well , for me , i dunno about you . . . ) . 

the acting from all is great , especially from the three leads . 

pacino was panned for his performance , chiefly because his accent wasn't puerto rican enough and , well , it wasn't as "" strong "" as his oscar-winning role in "" scent of a woman . "" 

well , his "" scent of a woman "" performance was great and all , but it was nothing really but , as comic kevin pollack said , a "" foghorn leghorn impression . "" 

in "" carlito's way , "" he's emotional , and strong , despite the fact that he's remorseful over his entire lifestyle , which he cannot change . 

i felt more for carlito brigante than i did for the tango-dancing , insult-throwing blind guy in "" scent of a woman . "" 

as i said , penelope ann miller is great , and she and pacino actually have very good chemistry . 

and they're scenes are well-written , with some good clever dialogue which adds some interest to an otherwise bland relationship . 

and sean penn is amazing as the coke-addicted rat attorney . 

every scene he's in , he has great energy , and even measures up to the greatness that is pacino . 

in smaller roles , john leguiziamo and luis guzman are great . 

 "" carlito's way "" is one of those films which you heard about briefly , but when you finally watch it , you're absolutely blown away . 

it's a wonderful film , a highly underrated little masterpiece which was shelved after it didn't do so hot . 

but trust me and check it out . 

it's a great little film , and proof that the residential critics and mass populus are not always right . 
"
"in roger michell's romantic comedy notting hill , william thacker ( hugh grant ) leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends it's name to the film's title . 

one day , american movie superstar anna scott ( julia roberts ) walks in to purchase a book on turkey . 

quickly enamored of each other , the two embark upon an on-again , off-again love affair replete with romance , humor , and the occasional lump in the throat . 

the film opens with a non-verbal cue to anna's stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actress's appearances in films and at premieres - coming out of limousines , walking the red carpets and such . 

without words , this sequence gives us a background to her character . 

following , however , is a set-up narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives . 

i don't know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn't have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film , and which never resurfaces after the movie's beginning , but there it is . 

if there were ever a clear case for "" less is more , "" this would be it . 

the film is told nearly first person from william's point of view , as he is in every scene . 

by nature of this arrangement , we get a very definite sense of what he is all about , and his nice guy personality wins us over easily . 

in fact , much of notting hill's strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis . 

a scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he's even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey-soaked apricots from his refrigerator . 

or take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image . 

william assures her he wouldn't say a word , then adds , "" well , i'll probably tell myself now and then , but i'd never believe it . "" 

great stuff . 

the downside to spending so much time with william is that we don't get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible . 

we're constantly exposed to william's thoughts , feelings , actions and desires , but don't actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him . 

there are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest , but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we're not sure what she's been thinking all the times in between . 

this , combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two , makes this hugh grant's film hands down . 

he gets the great scenes ( look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna ) , the great lines , and gives an overall wonderful performance . 

julia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actress's top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ( ala sandra bullock in a time to kill ) along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character's unpredictable behavior . 

anna doesn't get a lot of our compassion . 

this romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance , much of it supplied by grant himself , but with considerable help from the supporting cast . 

most notable is rhys ifans as spike , william's eccentric roommate , who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh . 

hugh bonneville , emma chambers , james dreyfus , and gina mckee bring up the guard as william's friends and family , particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister's birthday dinner , and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst . 

it's a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation . 

roger michell's use of visuals doesn't sweep us off our feet , but does give us more than your typical movie of this type . 

for example , there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass . 

whereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying "" eight months later , "" michell presents us with more interesting cues , such as william's walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him . 

another memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air . 

we're generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so , but in this case , the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a bird's eye view of the ground below . 

music is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the film's scenes , and some of this might have been better toned down , but in other areas it works to full effect . 

it's kind of a mixed bag , but still fares better than many of today's lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video . 

at least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate . 

notting hill's grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the all-time greatest film pairings , but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it . 

for a couple of hours , you should expect to laugh more than cry , and that's not so bad , now is it ?

"well , i know that stallone is 50 years old now , but in daylight he doesn't look it ! 

daylight is a great disaster movie . 

if you've seen cliffhanger , you'll know stallone's character already . 

a guy with a bad past , but is in the right place at the wrong time . 

a tunnel connecting new york and new jersey has both sides collapses when a group of robbers collide with a truck carrying * very * flammable toxic waste . 

a dozen or so people survive the collapses and the incinerating fireball ( and what a fire ball it was ! ) 

stallone , a former emergency medical service man , is chauffeuring a rich couple around , when they reach the outside of the tunnel , before the explosion . 

then , 30 minutes into the movie , boom ! 

>from here on , the plot takes a back seat , and we are treated to some of the best camera work and action staged . 

most all the action is plausible and will hold you at the edge of your seat . 

there are a few melodramatic parts here , but , they tend to work out well . 

there is no general antagonist in this film , but the action and suspense makes you forget all about that . 

daylight is a great film , i saw a non-matinee showing of it , and i thought it was worth every penny . 

the characterizations are mostly flat , one dimesional , but they have enough in them to get you to care for some of the characters . 

rob cohen ( dragonheart ) does a great job with this film .

"why do so many children's films treat their target audience with utter contempt ? 

too many of those who write or direct for children's movies assume that the kids just can't handle serious , thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues . 

 "" the iron giant , "" which was directed and co-written by brad bird , late of such animated series as "" the simpsons "" and "" king of the hill , "" assumes that not only can children handle such discussions , but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time . 

 "" the iron giant "" holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience , making it a film that's enjoyable for both children and adults alike . 

hogarth hughes ( voice of eli marienthal ) is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard-working single mother , annie ( jennifer aniston ) , in a small town in maine . 

after staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away , hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception . 

he comes across a giant robot ( vin diesel ) from space that eats metal for food . 

after saving the robot , nicknamed the iron giant , from electric shock , hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts . 

because of damage he suffered upon landing , the giant has forgotten what his original mission was , so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy . 

realizing he can't just keep the giant in a barn all the time , and that the giant needs food , he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean ( harry connick jr . ) , an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time . 

it soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can't keep the giant a secret forever , because a government spook named kent mansley ( christopher mcdonald ) has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security . 

he suspects hogarth knows something about the giant , and takes up residence in hogarth's house as a lodger . 

meanwhile , the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind . 

 "" the iron giant "" is exactly what family films ought to be , because it doesn' t talk down to its audience . 

the story is simple , very simple , about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy . 

it's very similar to the spielberg classic "" e . t . , ' and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of "" the iron giant . "" 

the film holds many of the better elements of spielberg's film , such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy . 

the film delivers several serious messages , the most important of which is one's ability to choose one's own fate . 

hogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be : a hero . 

the final sequence is touching and appropriate , though i won't give it away , i will say that very few will be disappointed . 

the animation , while not up to disney standards ( what could be , after "" tarzan "" ? ) , is good enough to make you forget you're watching a cartoon . 

the giant is computer-animated , while the human characters are all hand-drawn the old-fashioned way . 

the characters' faces are done quite well , drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible , but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief . 

fine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth , and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother . 

harry connick jr . does a nice characterization as dean , and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney ( of tv's "" frasier "" ) as an army general called in by agent mansley . 

unlike several cartoon features , each character is actually a developed personality , rather than a stereotype , and is actually integral to the plot , rather than being a superfluous comic-relief sidekick ( a clich ? disney still hasn't ditched ) . 

dean , for example , could have been a stereotypical beatnik ( his character profile seems to suggest that ) , but he is presented as a character with real emotions , thoughts , and motivations . 

even the heavy , agent mansley , is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to , but out of his own fear and paranoia . 

a lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper-thin stereotypes and figure the kids won't mind , but "" the iron giant "" has clearly put a little work into making the characters real , and it pays off . 

the film isn't only around to deliver heavy-handed messages , though . 

it's also very funny , and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy . 

the scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things , such as dive into a pool , are handled well , and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing , having worked on "" the simpsons "" for many years . 

a sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to "" outlast "" one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed , and also extremely clever . 

the film even takes some jabs at america's nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war , satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to "" duck and cover "" in the event of a nuclear attack . 

 "" the iron giant "" has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films , and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing . 

instead of seeing people get bonked on the head , we get well-timed , clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with . 

when you get right down to it , "" the iron giant "" is no more than the story of a boy and his robot . 

the story is so straightforward , so quaint , that it ultimately becomes charming . 

though i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person , when it comes to family entertainment , simple is the way to go . 

it's akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word , but it's not the story that sets the film above others of its kind , but rather the elements that go into the story , namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue , which "" the iron giant "" has in spades . 
"
"it should have been a classic . 

a great cast of respected supporting actors . 

an interesting premise of loser comic book characters . 

however , "" mystery men "" proved to be one of the great disappointments of 1999 . 

the jokes were bland and hackneyed from talents who have previously made audiences laugh with their unique rituals . 

the number of cliches and shallow characters made the film difficult to sit through seriously hurting its attempt of having a fast paced premise . 

the script tried to deliver a series of small jokes throughout the film but without a big laugh-out-loud joke and mediocre small jokes , it failed miserably at being entertaining at all . 

the jokes were not funny for a number of reasons . 

they had been used a number of times before in previous films , the best ones , which were mediocre to begin with , were ruined in the trailer , and the expectation of laughing at clever , unique gags from clever unique comedians when there were none to laugh at greatly damaged the film . 

 "" mystery men "" might have worked if it was an ensemble cast of newcomers trying to break into the business . 

but with veterans doing this kind of junk , it really questioned whether their other work was as funny as originally thought . 

thankfully most actors in this movie will appear in five other movies before the new year arrives to help viewers forget this little movie . 

the film follows a band of wannabe superheroes living in a wannabe gotham city who are ridiculed by their fellow citizens and villains because of their clumsiness and failure to save they day and capture the bad guy . 

the fact is these pathetic losers are not needed because their city already has a successful superhero , captain amazing , who has recently captured every evil-doer in the city . 

captain amazing ( played terribly by an uninspired greg kinnear ) , because of his success in the past , is worried that he will lose popularity . 

after freeing one of the most notorious bad guys in the city ( geoffrey rush , overacting just a bit too much ) to keep himself busy , things get out of hand when captain amazing is captured . 

it is up to the wannabe superheroes to save the day . 

by the time this section of the plot is finished , the interest for what happens ( if you haven't already figured it out ) is very low . 

there are very few scenes which catch the viewers complete attention . 

the first scene in the film , which shows the wannabes trying to save the day , feels like it was seriously edited down . 

right when it was beginning to become slightly funny seeing these actors get humiliated at an old folk's home by some masked goons , captain amazing comes in and saves the day ? or ruins the movie . 

instead of editing this scene , more editing should have been done in areas such as the unnecessary romance between mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and monica , a waitress ( claire forlani ) or the vast majority of the film , which is the heroes talking at a coffee table about how their day was . 

a simple rule : more silly action is needed in order to make a silly action movie work . 

another major problem with "" mystery men "" is that every actor in it seemed very uncomfortable and consequently gave terrible performances . 

the film depended on its cast to work fluently together , like a bunch of old friends working together in an amiable reunion . 

however , most characters seemed like they did not even want to be in this film or at least the script made it seem this way . 

to pull one of the actors in this film randomly out of a hat , paul reubens , who disappeared from acting to everyone's joy , returns here leaving very little to be impressed about . 

as a wannabe who uses flatulence for a weapon , all of his jokes must therefore be fart jokes . 

fart jokes that have all been heard before and will inevitably be heard again in future films thanks to the success of "" american pie "" and "" there's something about mary . "" 

 "" mystery men "" drags on towards the end to a point where anything else in the world is more entertaining . 

anyone with a brain knows each one of the heroes is going to be successful at their talent in the end and each one is going to contribute in a helpful way . 

so why continue to watch ? 

this film is far from a worthy guilty pleasure . 

 "" mystery men "" indeed does this and every time a character succeeds another one congratulates him and says "" i knew you could do it ! "" 

 "" mystery men "" fails in every category it attempts to pass . 

what makes this film so bad is that it had the potential to be wonderful and unforgettable . 

terrible acting , terrible script , and a terrible waste of time changes opinions about all of these actors . 

 "" i'm unpredictable ! "" 

an overexcited ben stiller shouts out . 

no ben , you're the complete opposite . 
"
"this feature is like a double header , two sets of clich ? s for the price of one . 

not only do we get the usual tired sports chestnuts , but the banal rich girl-poor boy love story is tossed in for good measure . 

an original moment in this loser is as rare as a chicago cubs world series appearance . 

the screenplay by kevin falls and john gatins , based on a story by falls , merely lobs its plotline at the audience . 

this is a story that needed sent down for seasoning and more coaching . 

summer catch centers around ryan dunne ( freddie prinze jr . ) , a cape cod youth chosen to participate in the prestigious cape cod baseball league , supposedly a showcase for the best young amateur and college players in the country . 

ryan is a blue-collar kind of guy . 

he works with his dad taking care of the lawns of cape cod's rich and famous . 

he also , as we are informed early , his own worst enemy . 

he has the potential and the talent , but always seems to self-destruct at the crucial moment . 

so , ryan tries to remained focused on baseball . 

then he meets tenley parrish ( jessica biel ) , daughter of one of the blue bloods whose lawn he manicures . 

tenley , a name only a hack screenwriter could invent , is unlike her snobbish counterparts and falls for ryan . 

if you can't figure out where all this nonsense leads , then you need a remedial course in film viewing . 

as always prinze is pretty to look at , but his performance mainly consists of facial expressions : puppy dog love , heartbreak , frustration , self-loathing or determination . 

biel cries a lot , while bruce davison merely acts smarmy as her class-conscious father . 

the only beacon is matthew lillard's fun-loving billy brubaker , the team's catcher . 

summer catch borrows situations and stylings from other baseball movies , such as bull durham and the natural . 

no curve balls here , no sliders . 

every pitch is predictable . 

a blind umpire could call this movie . 

summer catch is strictly rookie league moviemaking . 

it has as much chance of making the movie hall of fame as the dodgers have of moving back to brooklyn .

"if anyone had been able in 1983 to forsee a late-night cable show hosted by gilbert gottfried showcasing some of the worst films of the 80's , they'd agree d . c . cab is the quintessential "" usa up all nite "" movie . 

it's one of those childish r-rated movies that kids would love but can't see until it's edited for tv . 

it's also one of those pointless , almost plotless movies with hardly any laughs . 

and , strike three , it pairs mr . t with gary busey . 

i heard gilbert say d . c . cab had "" an all-star cast , "" but i'm still hoping there was some degree of facetiousness in that statement . 

when third-billing goes to a two-minute appearance by famed flashdancer irene cara "" as herself , "" you can't say a damn thing about all-star casts . 

likewise for token appearances by marsha "" roz "" warfield , paul rodriguez and "" politically incorrect "" host bill maher , before he was somebody . 

appearing in d . c . cab pretty much had the opposite effect on everyone else , especially irene "" i'm gonna live forever "" cara . 

d . c . cab is an ensemble comedy from joel schumacher ( who would go on to direct batman forever ) about a bunch of misfits who drive cabs . 

you get the feeling if the police academy cadets had made a different career choice , this would be the result , except here you have such interesting characters as the "" token white guy "" ( busey ) who wants to get in tight with the blacks now before they take over the world , the token jive talker named tyrone ( charlie barnett ) who wears his hair in rollers and uses the word "" honkey "" as much as possible , the tough guy with the mohawk and gold chains ( mr . t -- a real stretch for him ) , the aspiring musician waiting for his big break ( maher ) , the mexican gigolo ( rodriguez ) , the woman who actually wants to drive cabs for a living ( warfield ) and the guy who wants to own a cab company for a living ( adam baldwin ) . 

we've all seen dozens of bad comedies from the 80's . 

some are fun to watch and some are actually funny . 

this one is more or less neither . 

you'd think plenty of comedic sparks would fly from the assemblage of talent ( whatever ) , but d . c . cab more or less falls flat on a continual basis , culminating in the usual contrived hollywood finale as baldwin is kidnapped and the other cabbies have to go to rescue him . 

it's a shame no one was able to rescue this movie from the depths of stale jokes and unoriginality . 

d . c . cab has rightly earned its position on "" usa up all nite . ""

"after enduring mariah carey's film debut , glitter , i'm reminded of a bit from chris rock's bigger and blacker . 

in response to women saying that they can raise a child without a man , rock says , "" you can drive a car with your feet , but that don't mean it should be done . "" 

to that i say , you can give mariah carey a movie , but that certainly don't mean it should be done . 

sure , there are plenty of pop star film vehicles out there -- from the beatles' a hard day's night to the spice girls' spice world -- but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter . 

everything about this complete tripe is ludicrous . 

start off with the story , which -- as gruesomely predictable as it is -- is the least offensive part of the movie . 

the film is inexplicably set in the 80s , a period piece that really shows no sign of its period except for a few chicks in leg warmers . 

worse yet , everyone's speaking late 90s hip-hop slang in what should be 1983 . 

meant to be partially autobiographical , carey plays billie frank , a young singer in new york who struggles to overcome a rough childhood and abandonment by her alcoholic mother . 

influential club dj julian dice , a . k . a . "" lucky 7 "" ( max beesley playing a bad mix of puff daddy and robert de niro ) , hears her sing on a track , and decides to make her a star . 

in predictably rapid succession , billie and dice fall for each other , she starts hitting it big , dice gets jealous and starts acting like an ass , and suddenly billie's on "" the roller coaster of superstardom . "" 

in the meantime , billie is on an emotional hunt for her missing mom . 

i won't give away the ending , but -- honestly -- just think of unicorns and rainbows . . . 

you'll figure it out . 

the movie screams to be made with camp , and that could've been fun . 

but the filmmakers thought making the bulk of glitter weepy and dramatic would be better . 

what a mistake . 

the brief attempts at comic relief -- as in a scene where an effeminate russian-sounding director gets wacky with filming billie's first music video -- go over like lead balloons . 

instead , the audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during mariah's most dramatic scenes . 

which brings us to the performances , of which there's nothing good that can be said . 

mariah is primarily seen with a wide-eyed deer-in-the-headlights look frozen on her face . 

she actually looks scared during her one love scene . 

but you have to wonder if the writing isn't even worse . 

so much of the dialogue is so hackneyed and watered down for carey's virginal target audience that it's probably impossible for any actor to pull it off with aplomb . 

even the characters couldn't have been written more absurdly . 

they're all members of a barbie playset : the important film director who swoons , "" billie , i'd love to put you in a movie i'm making , "" and the big-time record executive who takes billie's demo tape and says , "" oh , i'll make sure the whole team listens to it in the morning . "" 

everyone in the film is a device , and it's painful to keep watching just to see another one appear . 

to say more would be a waste . 

there's so much wrong with this film . 

and , it pains me that mariah carey -- with her ego and sanity in such fragile condition these days , as evidenced by her multiple hospital stays -- will have to suffer through all the negative reviews she's likely to get . 

but , then again , i had to suffer through her movie . 
"
"movies based on video games , such as street fighter or mario bros . , have never generated much interest at the box office . 

but when the first mortal kombat movie came out in 1995 , it did surprisingly well . 

with a simple story , a pulsating soundtrack , and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes , the movie moved quickly and displayed lots of energy . 

it got my vote for 'the movie where i expected the least and got the most' . 

and , if you haven't had the opportunity , i would definitely recommend that you see it on video . 

in the world of mortal kombat , based on the popular arcade game , dark forces from outworld try to infiltrate earth's realm with the ulimate goal of total conquest and the destruction of humanity . 

the mortal kombat refers to a competition , fought by human mortals against outworld's minions , which if won , will guarantee earth's safety for another generation . 

mk2 picks up almost immediately after the humans return victoriously from competition . 

despite their victory , however , a gateway has somehow opened , and outworld continues in its quest to conquer earth . 

outworld's warriors include an impressive collection of fighters , including shao kahn , mintoro ( a centaur ) , sheeva ( a four-armed ogre ) , and sindel . 

earth's mortal warriors , under the leadership of the benevolent god , lord rayden , includes liu kang , princess kitana , sonya blade and jax , who must fight against outworld's forces . 

it's an easy enough premise , but unfortunately ( very unfortunately ) , the writers try to do too much with the movie . 

it is only a video game , after all , but the on-screen version tries to go beyond it's comic book boundaries by adding depth , a conceptualization of self-worth , and worst of all , a love story . 

this becomes very awkward , because all of the players are fighters and nothing more . 

they are likable and impressive when they are showcasing their martial arts and fighting skills , but look extremely awkward and uncomfortable when they are required to actually act . 

this becomes embarrassingly apparent , for example , as the movie tries to develop a romantic bond between liu kang and princess kitana . 

the original mk was smart in letting the players do what they do best . 

they spoke little , but fought a lot . 

thus , the movie was easy to digest . 

however , mk2 tries to give these players a certain amount of depth , an element that was lacking in the first movie , but the attempt here fails miserably . 

this uneasy feeling is readily apparent , for example , whenever you hear lord rayden speak . 

not only does he talk in riddles and offer enigmatic ( e . g . 

useless ) advice , but he speaks so slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom . 

try reading this half as fast , and you'll hear what i mean . 

but the movie is not a complete fatality . 

fight scenes are well-choreographed , highlighted by terrific acrobatics and agility . 

and players of the game will be rewarded with the inclusion of practically every character from the video game , although their screen time amounts to nothing more than a cameo . 

even if you're not familiar with the video game , each fighter has their own costume and unique weaponry to easily differentiate themselves . 

but it's just too little of what movie-goers and especially fans of the game will expect . 

oddly , the inclusion of the human element actually pollutes the purity of the mortal kombat essence . 

and the poor acting results in a muddled movie that offers the viewing audience little chance for survival . 

 ( i am now talking very slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom ) . 

rent the first one , but the sequel is for kombat fans only .

"this talky , terribly-plotted thriller stars alec baldwin as dave robicheaux , an ex-new orleans cop who gets ensnared in a murder- mystery after a light-plane crashes into the bayou beside his fishing boat . 

he and his wife annie ( kelly lynch ) rescue a little salvadorian girl ( samantha lagpacan ) from the wreckage and that's when the trouble begins . 

the other major players include a local drug lord ( eric roberts ) , his scheming wife ( teri hatcher ) , a soused stripper ( mary stuart masterson ) , and a shady dea agent ( vondie curtis hall ) . 

everyone knows everyone else and it makes for a collective that's curious but never compelling . 

based on the book by james lee burke , heaven's prisoners is so badly plotted that entire * scenes * seem to be missing . 

early on , we have no idea of why dave and annie keep the child to themselves . 

nor how they eluded both the coast guard and the faa . 

later , dave is reunited with a drug-abuser who appears seemingly clean and sober and without any explanation . 

huh ? 

the whole movie is like this , perhaps the result of some unkind cuts that happened during the eighteen months that the film sat on the shelf . 

whatever the reason , somebody should tell director phil joanou ( final analysis ) to recut this mess . 

in its present form , heaven's prisoners runs only two hours plus change , but it feels like four .

"nosferatu the vampyre ( germany 1979 ) 

a film review by mike watson copyright 1999 mike watson 

this extraordinary re-telling of bram stoker's "" dracula "" by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places in cinematic vampire lore . 

inspired by f . w . murnau's 1922 silent film of the same name , herzog's film is a work of exquisite bleakness , an oddly touching tragedy with a beautiful and uniquely haunting quality that lingers long afterwards . 

the original full-length english and german language versions of nosferatu have at last received a video release by u . s . distributor anchor bay entertainment , and in gorgeous widescreen prints . 

until now only a shortened english language version of the film was available on video , and only in europe . 

both of these re-releases restore the film to its full length , but viewers should still be wary of the english version due to its often stilted dialogue . 

apparently the english dialogue coach herzog had on the set during filming was incompetent , and some of the voices also seem to be dubbed . 

the german version with english subtitles remains the definitive one . 

everyone knows the story of dracula . 

or do they ? 

his story has been so bastardised on film over the years that a brief reminder of the basic plot certainly won't hurt . 

jonathan harker is a young lawyer sent to the gloomy castle dracula in transylvania to do business with a creepy count ( played by klaus kinski ) who wants to buy a house in harker's hometown . 

upon seeing a photo of harker's wife ( the radiant isabelle adjani ) he instantly falls in love with her . 

locking harker up in his castle , he sets off on a long journey to meet this woman whose beauty so bewitches him . 

upon divining his identity as a vampire , adjani seduces the count and lures him to his death one morning as the sun rises . 

that is a story familiar to millions , but herzog has elevated stoker's tale into the realm of - and i use this term a tad reluctantly - cinematic art . 

nosferatu is as much a meditation as it is a film , shot through blue-ish and white filters and peopled with characters who perform as if they were half hypnotised . 

the film's surreal , dream-like quality is utterly mesmerising . 

there is much to enjoy , but i'll limit my praise to a few key points . 

holding the film together is kinski's remarkable performance as count dracula . 

past screen portrayals , including bela lugosi's famous turn , have largely been one dimensional and tended towards camp . 

but kinski . . . oh boy , this is something far more compelling . 

aided by a startling make-up job , he portrays dracula's vampirism not simply as pure evil but as some sort of loathsome disease . 

this man is dreadfully lonely . 

he lives in utter solitude , shunned by the locals for his hideous appearance and reputation for bloodlust . 

kinski's portrayal of the count is both creepy and deeply affecting . 

when he dies , you almost feel as if this man's tortured soul has been freed at last . 

then there's the unforgettable soundtrack , largely composed by german group popul vuh . 

it is so eerily beautiful and evocative that it's quite impossible to imagine the film without it . 

popul vuh are longtime herzog collaborators and play an ancient-sounding kind of spacemusic using piano , chants , and exotic instruments . 

when i first saw this film some years ago i was so impressed i tracked down and bought a number of their albums . 

the one i still listen to the most is "" tantric songs "" , from which most of the music in nosferatu is taken . 

it's a testament to the music's depth that it is as powerful without the pictures as it is with them . 

the album is still available on the highly respected ambient and world music label celestial harmonies . 

this is a timely re-release by anchor bay . 

after francis ford coppola's unscary and woefully overblown version of bram stoker's tale in 1992 , it is a joy to go back to herzog's film and see the amazing things he has done with what is now a century-old story . 

to some aficionados , nosferatu is quite simply the greatest vampire film ever made . 

without a doubt , it is an unmistakable classic of the genre . 

don't miss it . 
"
"a pseudo-intellectual film about the pseudo-intellectual world of art magazines , high art is as wasted as its drug-addled protagonists . 

in the only notable part of the movie , ally sheedy and radha mitchell deliver nice performances in the two leading roles , not that lisa cholodenko's script or direction makes you care much about either character . 

living in a world of heroin induced highs , they float along until they fall in love with each other . 

this uninviting picture , full of pretentious minor characters , has a receptionist that reads dostoevski and a woman in the restroom line who is a certified genius , having recently been awarded a prestigious mcarthur grant . 

24-year-old syd ( radha mitchell ) , who has a rather bland , live-in boyfriend , was just promoted to assistant editor at the artistic photography magazine "" frame . "" 

although the receptionist is impressed , syd is mainly a gofer for her boss until she meets famous photographer lucy berliner ( ally sheedy ) . 

for her to do photos for "" frame , "" lucy demands that syd be promoted to editor and assigned to her since lucy fancies her . 

lucy lives with her current lover , a washed up german actress named greta , played with a frequently indecipherable series of mumbles by patricia clarkson . 

the two of them and their friends wile away their time snorting and shooting up dope , usually heroin . 

this does not happen in a single episode , but becomes more commonplace than sleeping in the picture . 

syd , who lives in the apartment below them , joins in on the fun and becomes a member of the zombie club . 

lucy seems pretty happy with her life of drugs , which apparently is funded by her mother . 

lucy quit working professionally 10 years ago since she thought she was being "" pigeonholed , "" and , since her mother has money , we can only assume that that's how lucy supports her habit and procures her living expenses . 

a typical scene has the editors arguing about whether a potential photographer's work is transcendental or merely classical . 

that no one has a clue as to the dogma they are spouting becomes obvious but not particularly funny . 

 "" your work has a cultural currency that is important now , "" is the artist-speak that the frame's manager uses to convince lucy to show her pictures in the magazine . 

when the big scene comes in which lucy puts the moves on syd , her idea of a romantic line is , "" i want to get high with you . "" 

in lucy's world , sex and drugs come hand-in-hand . 

and the movie , except for the obligatory scene of someone almost overdosing , shows drug usage as being a hip and natural part of the art scene . 

this vacuous picture throws in a standard downer ending in an attempt to manipulate our emotions . 

in another movie , it might have worked , but in this one the reaction is likely to be decidedly muted . 

high art runs 1 : 36 . 

it is rated r for explicit sex , pervasive drug use and language and is not appropriate for those younger than college age . 
"
" "" some houses are born bad , "" goes the haunting's tag line , to which i must add , "" some movies , too . "" 

nothing short of hiring a new cast , a more literate screenwriter , and a new director could have saved this tragically misguided adaptation of jackson's meritorious novel . 

the haunting is late entry summer dreck too slick to be creepy , and its seemingly endless stream of digital trickery and spooky ooky sound effects don't frighten so much as numb the audience into submission-the film is like a rube goldberg contraption rigged to shout "" boo . "" 

fragile nell ( taylor ) , bisexual theo ( zeta-jones ) , and smiley luke ( wilson ) are three insomniacs who gather at the reputedly possessed hill house for an extended study on sleep disorders , hosted by professor marrow ( neeson ) . 

marrow's secretly gathering data on their respective paranoid responses to his recount of hill house's bleak history . 

he's not prepared for the very real apparitions that terrorize the crew , nell especially , who has some ancestral connection to the manor's previous inhabitants . 

taylor is thoroughly insufferable in her first big-budget lead . 

for starters , her consistently dour expression sucks the life out of even the early scenes , when we're introduced to the mansion and all its fun-house trappings . 

her character is supposed to be depressed , having tended to an unloving mother for too many years , but taylor plays nell as supernaturally lame , alternately grouchy , mopey , wiggy and pathetic , and i kept wondering why the other characters didn't just ditch this bitch . 

as for the obscenely photogenic zeta-jones , she breezes through her scenes with a wink and a smile and takes the scenery with her . 

unfortunately , she's saddled with some of the most unlikely dialogue the screenplay has to offer . 

theo's assessment of the house ? 

 "" i love it ! 

sort of charles foster kane meets the munsters . "" 

who on earth would say that in place of "" citizen kane meets the munsters "" ? 

 ( furthermore , would you gladly spend a single night in a house befitting that description ? ) 

both actresses fare better than neeson , who looks embarrassed to be a part of this ensemble ( and for good reason ) , and his character is the most bland . 

as luke puts it , dr . marrow pulls the old "" academic bait and switch "" on his subjects , but he breaks down and confesses to this the second he's accused . 

later , he risks his life by climbing a crumbling stairwell to save nell ( it's amusing to hear neeson shout "" nell "" repeatedly , given his starring role in the 1994 jodie foster vehicle of the same name ) . 

why was this nice , helpful , and redemptive researcher so absent of ethics at the start ? 

the haunting was well designed by eugenio zanetti . 

his sets are obsessively detailed , and even before the cgi kicks in , they seem alive , never quite still . 

i do have one beef with this aspect of the production : the real life mansion used in exterior shots , nottinghamshire's harlaxton manor , is so vast that one has trouble believing that nell and company , no matter how much running away they do from ghosts and goblins , always finish up in locations that were established in act one , as if all the action has been confined to one wing of hill house . 

eighty million dollars was spent on the haunting , and despite a powerhouse box office debut , i doubt it will recoup its costs ( including marketing ) domestically . 

thank jan de bont for that : proving for the third time that speed was a fluke , in that it was actually enjoyable , de bont has served up another ride , sans thrill . 

his images , well-lit though they are , have an unmistakable been there-done that quality ; in fact , whole sequences , not to mention the cloaked , airy ghoul who owns the climax , feel lifted from a much smarter and infinitely more enjoyable spectacle from three summers back , peter jackson's the frighteners . 

i don't mean to suggest de bont is a plagiarist , i mean to suggest that he's a hack , having found no new ways to give us chills .

"every once in a while you see a film that is so effective in delivering the goods that it is easy to forget , and forgive , its glaring imperfections . 

such is the case with ? good will hunting ? , a subtle character study about a socially inept mathematics genius who struggles to find his path in life . 

despite some serious character problems , this is still a very good film . 

you probably know about the plot so i ? ll make it quick . 

will hunting ( damon ) is a janitor at m . i . t . , he ? s really smarter than einstein but nobody knows it . 

he likes to go out with his friend chuckie ( affleck ) and their other working-class buddies and drink beer . 

he ? s good-looking , charismatic , and witty but has a terrible time with authority and stiff college folk . 

after getting into a tiff with the law , a distinguished professor ( skarsg ? rd ) discovers will ? s genius and offers him a chance to clean up his record and avoid jail time , at a price : he must attend weekly sessions with a therapist and work on various mathematical problems ( that have stumped the academic elite ) with the professor . 

after outsmarting and scaring the hell out of a couple of different psychologists he meets his match when hooked up with a once-promising therapist named sean maguire ( williams ) who has his own problems . 

in the meantime will meets a british medical school student ( driver ) and they begin to fall in love . 

the story starts out well enough and is a pretty original basis for a film . 

even though we ? ve seen movies about misunderstood , erratic prodigies before ( ? shine ? ring a bell ? ) , the script here creates a complex narrative that doesn ? t just focus solely on one character . 

alas though , this is not a perfect film , as much as you feel like it could ? ve been while watching it . 

the one real problem i had with it is the unrealistic nature of the main character . 

is it possible for a lowly janitor to be this intelligent ? 

of course . 

is it possible for him to be estranged from any deep , human relationships ? 

usually , yes . 

but , is it possible for him to also be so handsome , funny , quick with the tongue , and city-street tough ? 

not very likely . 

come on , usually these guys are total nerds who can ? t even buy their own shirts , much less talk down a harvard student in a hip pub while picking up phone numbers from pretty med . -school 

girls . 

will is just a little too perfect , and in order to accept the character your disbelief suspension needs to be in excellent working condition . 

the heavy-handed , anti-war statement made by will at a government job interview late in the film is also boorish , overlong , pompous , and completely unnecessary . 

all this sounds pretty bad , but the film somehow makes up for it in other ways . 

damon ? s acting overshadows the fact that the character is slightly unbelievable , his performance is truly extraordinary . 

which leads me to the really good part of the review . 

the strength of this movie can be summed up in one single word : acting . 

i can ? t recall seeing a film recently that was so well-acted from top to bottom . 

from minnie driver ? s frustrated lover to ben affleck ? s laid-back best friend , and all the small roles in between , the performances are magnificent . 

robin williams ? skill is a given as a bereaved psychologist who could ? ve had a legendary career but was knocked off the path somewhere down the line . 

the real gem though is stellan skarsg ? rd ? s turn as professor lambeau , an award-winning mathematician who feels reduced in comparison to a younger , smarter will hunting . 

the scenes between williams and skarsg ? rd , as two old college pals who ? ve been brought back together by this enigmatic kid , display some of the best acting i ? ve ever seen . 

when i say delivering the goods , this is what i ? m talking about . 

watching these two work is what going to see movies is all about . 

gus van sant ? s ( to die for , drugstore cowboy ) cold , urban direction is right on , as well as danny elfman ? s sauntering musical score . 

i highly recommend ? good will hunting ? . 

despite its faults , it is still an intriguing and fascinating film and you are not likely to see a better acted one this year .

"at one point during brian de palma's crime epic scarface , the radiant michelle pfeiffer turns to a ranting al pacino and pops a question that the audience has no doubt been wanting to ask for themselves : "" can't you stop saying 'fuck' all the time ? "" 

fucking good question , that . 

it may not be an honour that instills the filmmakers with pride , but as far as i can tell oliver stone's script contains the said expletitive more times than any other film in cinema history . 

yet it would be a shame if bad language is all de palma's scarface is remembered for , because this is a damn fine gangstar flick . 

the overall structure is similar to howard hawks' 1932 original , but this time the scene has switched to miami , florida and our anti-hero's chosen vice is cocaine traffiking . 

pacino , sporting a thick cuban accent , gives one the best performances of his career ( golden globe nominated ) as tony montana , a cuban refugee with a criminal past who flees castro and comes to america to live the american dream . 

and live it out he does , with lashings of violence , abuse , murder and the funny white powder . 

from his earliest jobs as a drug runner for various middlemen , tony montana makes it clear to everyone he meets that he's not a man to be fucked ( sorry ) . 

soon he's the king of the cocaine heap , but his hot head and an increasingly out of control drug addiction prove his undoing . 

 "" never do your own stash "" , warns one character early in the film . 

as sure as night follows day , the emperor of miami eventually falls . 

writer oliver stone and director brian de palma make an explosive combination here . 

stone's script offers solid storytelling and some fine character development . 

montana is fascinating ; uneducated but calculating , a straight shooter who speaks from the heart ; an ambitious , violent man yet one with a conscience . 

a man fiercely protective of his beautiful 20 year old sister , not wanting her to be sucked into the glitzy , dangerous world which he inhabits . 

pacino is dynamite , taking to the role with a brooding , bristling energy which in his more recent films has often degenerated into just simple overracting . 

pfeiffer also registers strongly as the gangstar mole with no inner life . 

only once does tony express real affection for her and his desire to have children , and even then you sense all he really wants is a regular screw and a beautiful object to show off to his friends , and she's happy to oblige . 

this isn't as meaty a role for pfieffer as sharon stone's was in casino , but its an effective one nonetheless and she aquits herself well . 

as director , de palma sets up a number of dramatic scenes with his typical stylistic brauva . 

the escalating tension he creates in various mob situations - a drug deal gone wrong , an assination attempt - is often thrilling , and in this respect he is every bit the equal of scorese and coppola . 

where he differs from , say , coppola's godfather trilogy is in his overall treatment . 

coppola gives his crime sagas an operatic sweep , whereas in scarface de palma opts for a grittier feel . 

and it perfectly suits the material . 

the only major botch is giorgio moroder's mostly crap synthesier score . 

it's just not right , and unfortunately compromises the impact of some otherwise good scenes . 

as expected , scarface is very violent at times , but you shouldn't be watching gangster movies if that upsets you . 

at over two and a half hours in length it's a true epic , and if you're a fan of the genre you'll love f * * k-filled minute of it .

"from a major league baseball radio broadcast , featuring play-by- play man harry canary and color man whitey hashbrown , with special guest commentator james berardinelli . 

hc : as we go to the top of the 8th , we're joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli , who's here fresh from seeing the new baseball movie , major league : back to the minors , the third in the popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors . 

nice to see you , jim . 

as a big baseball fan and a movie reviewer , can you give us the scoop on the new flick ? 

jb : my opinion : the producers should have stopped while they were ahead , and that was nine years ago . 

one entry was definitely enough , and i'm surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low quality of major league 2 . this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released direct-to-video . 

it's worse than a mediocre made-for-tv feature . 

i should also mention that this movie likely won't play all that well in cleveland . 

now that the real indians are perennial contenders , they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks . 

actually , most of the action involves the twins' aaa minor league club , the buzz , rather than the actual major league franchise . 

hc : sorry to interrupt , jim , but we still have to do play-by-play for the game on the field . 

leading off this inning is john warren . 

he steps into the batter's box and takes kent's pitch low for ball one . 

wh : so , the story's strictly minor league , right ? 

what's it about ? 

jb : scott bakula , the guy from quantum leap , plays career minor league pitcher gus cantrell . 

when twins owner roger dorn , once again portrayed by corbin bernsen , needs a new manager for his aaa team , he offers the job to gus , who is now faced with two daunting tasks : turn the team around and groom hot prospect downtown anderson ( played by walt goggins ) for a promotion to "" the show . "" 

with the help of former major leaguers pedro cerrano ( dennis haysbert ) , rube baker ( eric bruskotter ) , and isuro tanaka ( takaaki ishibashi ) , gus gets the buzz on the right track . 

in fact , he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jealous manager of the big-league club , leonard huff ( played with over-the-top relish by ted mcginley ) . 

soon , dorn has arranged an exhibition game that pits gus' overachieving group against huff's overpaid , last-place bunch . 

wh : can we guess who wins ? 

jb : the results have all the suspense of watching the videotape of a game when you've already seen the box score . 

on top of that , none of the mock-ups are presented with much flair . 

they're not just boring ; they're lackluster . 

but the major league movies have never been about drama or tension ; they've been about using baseball situations to generate laughs . 

hc : warren fouls off a fastball . 

1 and 1 . 

wh : are there lots of yuks in this one ? 

jb : not one , from start to finish . 

i enjoyed the first major league because it was reasonably fresh and funny . 

okay , a lot of the jokes were sophomoric , but they made me laugh . 

the two sequels haven't just been stale , but their humor quotient has been abysmally low . 

even bob uecker's once-sharp one-liners have turned lame , and they're the closest the film comes to being even vaguely amusing . 

hc : here's the 1-1 pitch . 

looooooong drive ? fair or foul ? foul ball ! 

the count goes to 1 and 2 . 

wh : does the film at least get the baseball details correct ? 

jb : yes . 

there aren't any glaring errors like there were in one of the best-ever baseball movies , the natural . 

but i'd gladly trade a technically accurate film for one with a good story , believable characters , or even a little genuine humor . 

heck , the naked gun is a better baseball comedy than major league : back to the minors . 

wh : it's nice to see old friends one more time , isn't it ? 

like cerrano , tanaka , and dorn . 

jb : depends on whether you really care that anyone is back . 

there aren't any real characters here ? just an assortment of cliched oddballs . 

yeah , the voodoo hitter , the catcher who can't throw back to the pitcher , the japanese player , and the conceited player-turned-owner have all returned , but who really cares ? 

they have no depth . 

notable absences include tom berenger's veteran and charlie sheen's "" wild thing . "" 

we don't really miss them , though . 

hc : breaking ball , low and outside . 

2 and 2 . 

wh : so you're saying that we should give this one a miss ? 

jb : that's right . 

to use baseball terminology , it's a three-pitch strikeout . 

if you're looking for a good movie that involves baseball , try popping the natural , field of dreams , bull durham , or even the first major league into the vcr . 

actually , this is an oddly-timed release , since baseball fans are likely to be spending more time in parks than in theaters . 

even the minor league seasons are already underway . 

don't bother with major league : back to the minors . 

it's a wretched time- waster . 

wh : thanks for the advice . 

jb : you're welcome . 

hc : and here's the 2-2 pitch . 

fouled back , right into this booth . 

hey , jim , heads up ! 

oops . 

somebody better get him some ice for that . 

he may be good at deflecting bad baseball movies , but he needs to learn not to duck into foul balls . 

odd how warren seemed to aim that ball right at him , almost as if he has a grudge to settle . 

anyway , back to the action on the field ? 
"
"i wish i could accurately describe the theme music for part 3 . 

the best way i can put it is that it's funky . 

i know this is an odd question , but remember the opening music of "" police academy 4 : citizens on patrol "" , when steve guttenberg and michael winslow perform the title song "" citizens on patrol "" during the opening credits ? 

it's just like that . 

anyway , part 3 takes place a day after the events of part 2 ( so technically still 1985 ) . 

this time , a group of horny teens ( who also bring along two aging hippie potheads for some reason ) head up to a cabin on crystal lake for a weekend of sex and weed . 

it turns out that one of the teens had been attacked by jason earlier in her life ( which must have been between parts 1 and 2 ) so why she has returned to crystal lake one day after a new batch of murders is beyond me . 

she's the lone survivor this time . 

part 3 was originally shown in theaters in 3-d , and from what i can tell from the video , it looks as though they may have been fairly decent effects . 

jason had long , wild hair when he was unmasked in part 2 . now , one day later he's completely bald . 

also , it being one day later , it can't be friday the 13th now can it ? 

oh well . 

steve miner is the only director who helmed more than one film in the series .

"the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do . 

lives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment's notice . 

the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower . 

most of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants . 

it takes a pretty smart person to do that . 

but what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ? 

what if he's also able to think on his feet ? 

in fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ? 

it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray's the negotiator . 

in this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force . 

when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman's home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder . 

faced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain's office . 

i don't quite remember if the captain actually said , "" i hate to do this , but . . . "" , 

although it wouldn't surprise me if he did . 

luckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above . 

after being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t . 

walsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed . 

although roman's actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue . 

jackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman . 

the actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats . 

the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence . 

how can we believe he's going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ? 

unfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it's would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson's acting ability . 

almost every time he's in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back . 

when spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course . 

his is an interesting character . 

made out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation . 

 "" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can't talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , "" he says . 

when he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be . 

soon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail . 

this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor . 

as the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely . 

gray really lucked out with this cast . 

david morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey . 

the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d . a . 

in l . a . confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land . 

with the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven . 

also in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides . 

his character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything . 

fortunately , this doesn't distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout . 

j . t . walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances . 

sadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film . 

walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon . 

for one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton . 

when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) . 

the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh , and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role , it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing . 

in the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it's reality . 

we're served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best . 

as an audience , we're also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie , and we'd like to see if one will dominate the film . 

both provide some pretty good entertainment . 
"
"my giant begins with a monologue that's more funny than not and a distinctive `princess bride , ' medieval fairy-tale-in-the- ? 90s feel . 

i was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was , with very funny scenes occurring on a movie set in romania where talent agent sammy ( billy crystal ) is visiting a client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream . 

and when sammy meets max , his giant , mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan , there is magic in the air ; albeit it a bit goofy , i loved every minute of it . 

the film , of course , plays on the size difference between the two , and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects . 

i particularly enjoyed a shot of sammy dangling his legs from a max-sized chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons . 

i also liked jere burns' ( from tv's `something so right' ) performance as the director of the film in romania . 

at this point , the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand , particularly during his fast-paced first scene . 

it is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate , as i did understand him more as the film continued and i became accustomed to his speech . 

however , about the time muresan becomes coherent , the characters head to new york and the film takes a dive . 

off the high board . 

suddenly , we are expected to believe sammy is a do-whatever-it-takes slime ball . 

up until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be sure , but he didn't come off as a desperate jerk . 

if he had , the first scenes could never have been so lighthearted and magical . 

but now , in new york , we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son , and his character is desperate enough to involve max in a disturbing giant vs . midgets wrestling match , which i found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of the film . 

indeed , many scenes stuck out of this film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces . 

this includes the scenes featuring steven seagal , when sammy gets max a role in a big , hollywood movie filming in las vegas . 

while i enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself , the scenes appeared to exist solely because of his participation , rather than because the film demanded it . 

and the audience is required to take a huge leap to believe that max would win the role based on his quotations of shakespeare . 

at this point i found myself thinking , `we're supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in a film ? ' 

then i realized he was , and i was watching it . 

in the final third , the film undergoes another transformation , this time to unbridled sentimentality . 

note : major plot points are revealed in this and the final paragraph . 

max went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love , lillianna , who hasn't seen him since he was a normal-sized kid . 

her refusal to see max ( unbeknownst to him ) leads us to an awkward `ends justify the means' scene as sammy's wife serena , played nicely by kathleen quinlan , poses as lillianna . 

i found this scene offensive . 

not only did it rely on deception to induce warm , fuzzy feelings from the audience , it reduced max to someone we should pity and coddle , which i thought was quite undeserved . 

i think max could have handled the truth , gratuitous illness and all . 

late in the film we learn max , and in fact all giants , have a heart condition which shortens their lives considerably . 

this could be an enlightening revelation , but the film seemingly presents it only to justify sammy's transformation into a caring , sensitive guy -- and hey , a great dad and husband , too ! 

`my giant' suffers from a poorly constructed story line and undeveloped characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their own internal persuasions . 

a stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on max's struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammy's struggles to get money and become a better person . 

in this scenario , max's illness could have been a integral part of the film not a story motivator . 

sentiment and emotion would have followed naturally . 

instead , we're apparently not supposed to like sammy until the end , but we're not allowed to focus on max . 

crystal and muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable performances , but in the end , `my giant' left me feeling like i'd been fed gruel from a giant spoon . 
"
"in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \ professor with such lived-in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance . 

ever since wall street , douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid-80's . 

in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen , with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world . 

you'd think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good-natured veneer , but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton , douglas played the role straight and out in the open . 

in wonder boys his performance isn't showy or a tour de force , it's simple yet truthful . 

he embodies grady , a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes . 

grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map . 

when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop , we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms . 

grady points out , in his narration , that they only do so out of jealousy . 

their target is the very writerly named james leer ( played by the always understated tobey maguire ) , a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for . 

leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions . 

he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges . 

he's portentous and gloomy , as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers , though his act is a little too calculated . 

he reminds me of the self-imposed outcast film director , jim jarmusch ( dead man , ghost dog ) . 

whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner ( the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer ) , exclusively dressed in black , and with his spiked hair dyed snow white . 

leer is similar , a guy who equates quirks with depth . 

tobey maguire fits well in the role . 

with his round , sweet-eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude . 

but unlike cort , maguire is easier to warm up to ; he's a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility . 

katie holmes plays hannah , a beautiful , talented writing student just itching to get in grady's pants . 

this is a plot line i had trouble with . 

douglas , in his old age , is beginning to resemble jerry springer , a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions . 

at first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady ( maybe it's because i'm jealous , and wish holmes was throwing herself at me , after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth ) , then i think of douglas's real life companion , the breathtaking catherine zeta jones . 

seeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping . 

suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand ( that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie ) and i'm pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas . 

there is a movie in there somewhere . 

grady , rather chivalrously if you ask me , resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell ( a droll frances mcdormand ) , who is his age , but also married to another professor . 

okay , maybe not so chivalrous . 

there is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says , "" she was a junkie for the printed word . 

lucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice "" . 

robert downy j . r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm . 

downy has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual . 

he's arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance . 

the actor is perfectly cast here , and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor . 

i wish wonder boys had more of him . 

searching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless , for it meanders through its running time , but that's part of its charm . 

and maybe i'm a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia , a place i'm greatly fond of , and a place rarely explored in american cinema . 

everyone has a sub-genre ( be it war films , westerns , dance movies ) that they happen to be privy to . 

i'm privy to films about literary types i . e . 

those individuals enthralled by the written word , and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch . 

the direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters , rather than generic mapped out story points . 

sometimes the dialogue is too clever , but that's a problem i wish i found with films more often . 

another minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted , like its characters , but as the story progresses it begins to open up . 

for me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types , and as a low-key comedy for its chuckle-worthy throwaway gags . 

the gags are like those in the great robert altman ( m * a * s * h , the long goodbye ) movies , where jokes exist as asides on the fringes , like jokes in life often do . 

the broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog , and incessant smoking of marijuana isn't ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things . 

curtis hanson , who before his last film , la confidential , toiled about with exploitation fare like losin' it ( an early tom cruise sex comedy ) and the hand the rocks the cradle , has graduated to more meaningful films . 

he directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style , the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up . 

the morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party , but in a wonder boys party , it fits . 

the film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen . 

it's the cinematic equivalent to a good read , novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies . 

many will find it slight , but i found much to savor among its subtleties . 
"
"we share the descent into darkness of a talented boy pianist . 

years later we see his subsequent resurfacing ; in the mid 80's a damaged man walks out of a rainstorm and back into the world . 

the movie charts the causes of his mental breakdown . 

based on the life story of david helfgott , this australian film is a rich exploration of the pressures drilling in upon a child-genius , compounded by the looming shadow of a domineering father . 

in the 1950's helfgott emerged as a child prodigy . 

the film traces his relationship with his father , whose encouragement comes at the cost of demanding david have no life beyond that of the black and white keys . 

david is offered places in the usa , but his father refuses to let him leave australia . 

the effect this has upon helfgott is cleverly told via a single reverse tracked shot ; david is sobbing on the front doorway of his music teacher's house . 

he is well lit via the external house lights . 

his teacher isn't home . 

we pull back and see that the dark front room's window has it's curtains open . 

there , in a pool of blackness , is a grand piano . 

david's fall over the dark cliff has begun . 

instead of being told in a linear mode , shine jumps around in time , ala "" pulp fiction "" . 

this narrative device works well ; we see david as a boy , teenager in london and mental-patient in various snippets . 

the film then neatly loops back for its uplifting conclusion . 

adult-helfgott's return to the light is told in linear fashion . 

the lead role is played by 3 different actors , with the teenage-david ( taylor ) and adult-david ( rush ) standing out . 

whilst rush is known for his tv work in australia , i think this is his first major cinema work . 

his david , whilst clearly damaged - he keeps quoting his "" daddy "" in a babbling word torrent , cuddles strangers and grabs women on the breasts - is both touching and funny . 

taylor's teenage-david is the more sympathy producing role . 

we are mute witness to his gradual breakdown as the pressures just keep on building . 

his father wants him to play the very demanding rachmaninov's 3rd , whilst his teacher wants to start him with a simple mozart . 

technically this is a beautiful film and a lot of thought has gone in to the production . 

i particularly like the use of slow motion and sound effects . 

one scene has adult-helfgott happily babbling in a car in the rain . 

the sound of the windshield wipers fades up over his voice . 

with a clever subtlety , the wiper sound appears to morph into a rhythmic thumping , but of the same beat . 

the image dissolves and we realise the thumping is the slow motion applause of a crowd . 

but it's us being clapped . 

we are young-david walking up to the stage for our first public show . 

the music , as you would expect from a film of this subject matter , is critical . 

and it works very well . 

the 'miming' of the actors piano playing is faultless ( apparently rush didn't mime ; he really did play ) 

helfgott's life is certainly not without it's sympathetic people . 

indeed his return to the 'normal' world is accelerated by his chance meetings with two very special women . 

his ultimately uplifting story is a magic piece of theatre craft . 

it shows that with the 'help of god' we can all find our way back home . 
"
"just how inseparable is the team of sgt . 

martin riggs ( mel gibson ) and sgt . 

roger murtaugh ( danny glover ) ? 

let's just say that when one partner asks the other partner to strip to his boxer shorts and then further asks him to run out into the middle of the road , flapping his arms while feverishly cackling like a chicken just to create a distraction , his partner actually does it ! 

the familiar lethal weapon family is back , including rene russo , who is now the expectant mother of riggs' child and joe pesci as the soprana-like , foul-mouthed former accountant who has decided to become a private eye . 

new to the team is chris rock , also a fast-talking , up and coming detective . 

trouble seems to follow the two veteran detectives where ever they go , and in this film , that is no exception . 

even when they are just taking a leisurely boat ride , they somehow manage to collide with a freighter ship . 

we here some ominous music , which clues us that a confrontation is about to happen . 

gunfire ensues , and when it's all over , the detectives want to learn more about this freighter by questioning a chinatown crime lord . 

although they don't know what they're looking for , their inquisitiveness causes the bad guys to take some action . 

and there's plenty of action here for two movies . 

led by fighting sensation jet li , whose martial arts skill is nothing less than impressive , he does what he can to make sure that no one finds out what they are up to . 

li is ruthless in his approach , will kill anyone just to make a point , and develops enormous disdain for the two detectives . 

there are terrific car chases , explosions and gunshot galore . 

it's a summer action recipe followed to the letter , and the result is nothing less than pure , unadulterated summer fun . 

but even too many explosions can get boring . 

to counter that , we are treated to several amazingly choreographed fight sequences with jet li . 

luckily , he'd rather fight hand-to-hand instead of firing off guns . 

meanwhile , when the detectives aren't reloading their guns or running from fireballs , they're engaged in sophomoric banter and silly conversations that provide a nice diversion from the hail of bullets . 

everybody gets in on the shtick . 

russo screams during her delivery , the crime lord has a few funny bits when he's being interrogated while being given laughing gas , and pesci and rock are very funny as they go at it discussing the drawbacks of having cellular phones . 

gibson and glover are always in sync and the film moves at a brisk pace to get to the final and terrific mano a mano . 

score one for the old guard . 
"
"showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven , director , and joe eszterhas , writer . 

their last effort , basic instinct , played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock , with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry-spiced tabasco sauce ; a dish not to everyone's taste , but certainly a well-crafted movie . 

possibly that movie's greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage , prior to the movie , during the movie , and after the movie . . . 

and that , after bringing all the plotlines together neatly , it left the viewer with full knowledge of what * would * happen in the characters' future , so there was no need to film it . 

there was actually about four hours' worth of screen story there , but eszterhas found ways to get it all on-screen in two , by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on ; and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails . 

the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls . 

we have attractive , sympathetic , but still highly repellent characters ; we have shows for the eyes and the ears , plotlines that play on several levels , we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable , and we have a story of an innocent ( who may not be so innocent ) who's trying to play straight , trying to improve her station in life , who slips into behaving the way those around her do . . . 

but recovers with a flourish , and quits a winner . 

in this sense , the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven , who's not known for treating his characters well ; but nomi , the part played by elizabeth berkley , definitely opts out of the game in a positive way , and we're left feeling good about her future . 

this is not one of the great movies , but it's far better than we'd been led to expect by all the negative pre-release publicity . 

verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971 , and in the last quarter-century has pushed farther and farther , experimenting with the socially-acceptable limits to movie-making . 

his most recent three movies , robocop , total recall , and basic instinct , have been a progression of back-door access to american culture , moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives ; and now he's exploring the sleeze . 

this movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director's contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie . 

 ( verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating , although his original version is available on video . ) 

many reviewers have taken the politically-correct stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing ; but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies , it's about people in an environment where naked ladies are common , and why such an environment should exist . 

it's about the scum who use other people as power-trip toys , and the need to escape their power . 

it's about a world where sex is nothing and normal human values don't pertain ; and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment . 

an nc-17 movie which isn't sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty , power , or value . 

the one scene in the movie that * could * have been a good sex scene , berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool , is not exciting , because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator . 

if anything , it's a rape scene with a victim who's been duped into cooperation . 

you don't make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors ; you don't make a movie about world war ii without a few guns going off and a few people getting killed ; and you don't make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls . . . 

and in an awful lot of vegas shows , an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing . 

this is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment industry , in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity . 

showgirls de-glamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries with great effectiveness . 

nomi is played , in a very good performance , by elizabeth berkley , who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents who's at the end of her rope , desperate to live a life better than the one she's known . 

she has nothing to market except her body and her limited dancing ability , and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker , trying to be something better than she seems destined to be . 

when nomi realizes she's gone too far for too little , she catches herself just in time to save the most essential part of who she wants to be . 

gina rivera plays molly , a dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi , providing her with what may be the one solid , positive relationship in nomi's entire life . 

molly is the one who makes the difference , and provides the role model and framework nomi needs to verify the value system she'll be using for the rest of her life , and nomi's feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomi's decision . 

gina gershon plays cristal , an aging , but still very attractive starring dancer , a reflexively competitive manipulator who's become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her . 

gershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner and raquel welch ; a fading talent made bitter by self-awareness . 

her character is very well drawn and performed ; in a major scene in a hospital room , she acknowledges what she is , and , in essence , passes the torch to nomi . 

the relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie , and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow a different path . 

it is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe ; molly is an honest , hard-working person who means well , and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality . 

cristal is a talented dancer who's compromised her ideals and sold herself to be a co-operating part of the system , exchanging self-respect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas . 

nomi believes she can make it without selling herself , succumbs to a degree , and then realizes she can make it without selling herself , and doesn't need las vegas or its brand of "" stardom . "" 

the male parts in this movie are simply props ; they exist only to demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exist . 

kyle maclachlan , whose single best previous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden , gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two legs , camouflaged as a nice guy . 

glenn plummer plays a dancer who's working as a bellboy , and provides a bit of alternate perspective . 

plummer's character is the only one in the movie who's maintaining an interest in dance as a performing art , but even he's succumbed to the cult of manipulation . 

plummer's character is the closest thing to a sympathetic male character in the whole movie . 

some of jost vacano's cinematography is fantastic , and one particular delineation of nomi's character alteration , a no-dialog scene using nothing but color changes in the lighting , is utterly terrifying . 

this movie is rated nc-17 due to language , sexual situations , full frontal nudity , violence , and probably the costuming as well . 

i don't see a way this particular story could have been told well without it , and i regard it as a legitimate exercise in movie-making . 

but don't go see it if you're not in a tough mood ; the only person it's possible to like in this movie ends up in an i . c . u . 

on life support , and there is probably not one character in this movie you'd enjoy meeting in person .

"yet another brainless teen flick , this one is about , surprise , drugs and sex . 

stars katie holmes and sarah polly couldn't look more bored . 

their characters are cardboard cut-outs of every cliched teenager out there . 

one thing you need to know is i really hated this movie . 

everything about it annoyed the hell out of me . 

the acting , and script , the plot , and ending . 

the director ( of the fluke hit swingers ) could have very well directed a bunch of no-name actors and had a watchabe film . 

the "" big "" stars of go pretty much drown the project of any originality . 

i felt like i was watching dawson's creek episode 200 . 

although the film still would have stayed at red despite its cast .

since when is a male character's sudden outing of the closet considered a surprise in hollywood anymore ? ? 

go is dawson's creek + varsity blues - she's all that = go home and watch something else .

" "" jaws "" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen . 

the movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds . 

then it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams' now infamous score . 

dah-dum . 

from there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . 

right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once "" jaws "" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . 

perhaps what is most outstanding about "" jaws "" is how spielberg builds the movie . 

he works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . 

unlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . 

until then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams' music . 

he's building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark's arrival is truly terrifying . 

he doesn't let us get bored with the imagery . 

the first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn't been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years . 

the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn't want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money . 

brody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute . 

hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( "" it's a perfect engine , an eating machine "" ) make it that much more terrifying . 

when vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . 

the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it . 

 "" jaws "" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror . 

it is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it's no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by "" star wars "" ) . 

even today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock's "" psycho , "" and it never seems to age . 

although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill . 

the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects . 

scheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time "" jaws "" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman . 

nevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark . 

scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what's right and going against the entire town . 

 "" it's your first summer here , you know , "" mayor vaughn warns him . 

dreyfuss , who had previously been seen in "" american graffiti "" ( 1973 ) and "" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz "" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers . 

however , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie's captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards . 

bordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism . 

he's slightly deranged , and shaw's performance is almost a caricature . 

however , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars . 

quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s . 

indianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese . 

his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen . 

shaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film . 

of course , we can't leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind's fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature . 

a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in "" jaws , "" and they are a threat . 

every one of spielberg's subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into . 

the shark in "" jaws "" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed "" bruce "" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles . 

many have forgotten , but "" jaws "" was a sort of precursor to "" waterworld "" ( 1995 ) , a movie's who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb . 

but , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood .

"the reunion film is not an original idea in any way , shape , or form . 

it's been done throughout film history over and over again , and has become one of the many sub-genres , like the prep school sub-genre , the angst-filled teen sub-genre , and the slasher sub-genre . 

what makes "" peter's friends "" so remarkable is not how it doesn't follow the rules of this sub-genre , but how it follows it so well , and creates characters that i wouldn't mind hanging with . 

what are the rules of the reunion sub-genre ? 

well . . . . 

1 . you need a group of friends , most of them married or at least dating , and sometimes even married or dating eachother . 

2 . you need to have them brought back together over some sort of a crisis . 

3 . they are not to have spoken together much since they split apart . 

4 . the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by 10 . 

5 . they all have to be slightly to highly neurotic . 

6 . the reunion has to bring them together , seperate them with little crises , then bring them back together because , after all , they're friends . 

7 . there has to be some sex or at least some making out either between the friends or with other people that are there or were invited . 

8 . eightly , they're all unhappy or marginally so . 

9 . there's some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them that's built up over the years . 

10 . the friends are all wildly successful in the world of entertainment and the arts , sometimes internationally so . 

11 . the film is filled with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends , sometimes causing them to get together in dance/song . 

since it follows these rules so closely , it will probably be ( and has been ) coined off as just a "" british 'big chill . ' "" 

and in some ways it is . 

both follow the rules , as i said , and both feature lots of bitching , big confessionals , and broken relationships . 

but while "" the big chill "" was , at least to me , a tad too whiny and unsatisfying , "" peter's friends "" hits its mark , making this film funny , dramatic , and poignant . 

the friends of peter's were all in the same theatre group back in '82 , performig wildly outrageous british acts for people far too stuck up to enjoy them ( the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops and tutus ) . 

after peter's ( stephen fry ) wealthy father ( richard briers , hardly on screen enough to register , but oh well ) dies , leaving a giant mansion to him , he has to decide whether or not to keep it . 

not sure what to do with it immeadiately , he decides to throw a giant reunion party , inviting back all his old chums . 

of course , all or most of his chums follow the tenth rule . 

andrew ( kenneth branagh , also directing here ) is an actor who's unhappily married to a tv star , carol ( co-writer rita rudner ) . 

maggie ( emma thompson ) is a successfuly publisher of self-help books , but looks like she needs them more than her customers , as she is lonely and unhappy . 

roger and mary ( hugh laurie and imelda staunton , who were also married in "" sense and sensibility "" ) are married , and are the most successful creators of jingles in the uk , but have suffered a tragedy as one of their newly born twins has recently died . 

and sarah ( alphonsia emmanuel ) is as promiscuous as ever , having a new boyfriend as of two weeks named brian ( tony slattery ) who's married and wants a divorce because of her , giving her doubts . 

as for peter , things seem okay . . . 

the film features lots of inner-friend jokes , and even some old theatre anecdotes ( which i at least find a lot of fun in , as i've done lots of theatre myself ) . 

and there are big confessions , brawls between the friends , and by the end , almost everyone is unhappy , even though some have resolved their problems long before the end ( which i kinda dug ) . 

the final twist would seem forced an anti-climactic , but for some reason , i felt the same way the rest of the friends did . 

maybe it's because the people in this film are so likable that i just wanted to join their clique . 

that's really what makes "" peter's friends "" so lovable : the way you just want to hang with a group of friends who can be so dysfuntional sometimes , but when someone's in crisis , can come together wonderfully for one another . 

it's when you have a giant crisis like this and people want to selflessly help you out instead of subtely pushing you away that makes you realize you have true friends , and these people are true friends . 

not to mention kenneth branagh is able to make the film seem nostalgic for the 80s ( a decade i grew up in , unfortunately ) without taking us outside of the 90s . 

there are some 80s classics and anti-classics like tears for fears "" everybody wants to rule the world , "" but unfortunately no stupid/fun 80s songs ( i think if i ever did an 80s reunion film , i'd put some crap go gos song on , or at least some good old "" come on eileen "" ) , but this is the british 80s we're talking about . 

oh well . 

but anyway , the direction is pretty good , although nothing amazing . 

branagh's forte is really making shakespeare fresh and magical , but at least he's very good with making a less ambiguous film like this . 

the writing is good from rita rudner and martin bregman , with lots of good one-liners , and even some really bad but good puns ( to mock the fact that andrew lives in l . a . , peter , while cutting some logs , asks him is he has wood in l . a . , and andrew says , "" no , but we have hollywood "" - punishment like that ) . 

the actors , as in most speaking movies , are better than their material , though , with some stand-out performances to the six friends , as well as the outsiders like slattery , rudner , and phyllida law as the old housekeeper of the peter's mansion . 

a little note should be made about hugh laurie's performance , as he looks like he took some massive doses of prozac before doing this - i mean , i've never seen him actually act this dramatically . 

 "" peter's friends "" is a really enjoyable film which makes people like me pine for some sort of future reunion , although i don't know what kind i'll have ( like most people , i don't look forward to my high school reunion ) . 

because of the way these friends are still able to maintain the same amount of care they have for one another and after such a long period of seperation , i just look forward to the day when i can have friends like that .

"you always have to be careful with the first official studio release out of the gate each year . 

they're obviously films for which the studios have no great hopes ( having missed both the deadline for academy award eligibility and the big box-office holiday season ) . 

combine that with howie long's first starring action role , and you've got a doozy of a movie that , while not as bad as it could have been , isn't a very good film . 

howie stars as an ace smokejumper ( a firefighter who parachutes into forest fires unreachable from the ground ) . 

in the slightly contrived opening scenes , we witness his heroism in action , as he , and his mentor ( played by scott glenn ) attempt to rescue a small girl and her dog from an oncoming forest fire . 

william forsythe plays the bad guy , a mass murderer who has several million dollars tucked away to help fund his jailbreak . 

he ( and five convict cohorts ) manages to get selected for firefighting duty when a woodland blaze just happens to ignite nearby . 

his escape plan bets a lot on the laxity of the guards , but ( since there must be a movie ) luck is with him . 

soon the now-escaped convicts are masquerading as canadian firefighters . 

why canadian ? 

who knows , eh ? 

along the way they pick up a pretty birdwatcher ( suzy amis ) to be their hostage . 

enter howie long . 

he's called in to help fight the blaze , and when he spots the group of "" ground pounders "" , apparently lost , he parachutes in to help . 

when he discovers their true identity , he is the only thing standing between them and escape , and the only hope of help for the hostage . 

long's acting talents are above those of , say , steven seagal , but not by much . 

although his delivery is mostly flat and wooden , he's a likeable hero , and there are some hints here and there that he may get better . 

the script doesn't help him out any , however . 

all too often , it veers into the realm of the unintentionally funny . 

the dialogue is strictly b-movie material , and the plotting relies too heavily on coincidences to be believable . 

long's co-stars are a mixed bag . 

at least they're all comfortable in their respective roles . 

forsythe has the scenery-chewing villain down cold , down cold , and scott glenn is always enjoyable to watch , even when he doesn't seem to be stretching his talents ( as is definitely the case here ) . 

suzy amis plays peril pretty well , but isn't given much more to do . 

some of the nature and wildfire shots are interesting , but many are rather bland . 

you'd think that the director , dean semler , a former cinematographer , would at least produce a film with interesting visuals . 

that's not the case . 

there's a lack of originality to nearly all the sequences . . . we've 

seen this stuff before . 

it's not the most auspicious start to 1998 , but it could have been worse ( just think back to 1996's debut , bio-dome ) . 

however , after a month of oscar-caliber pictures , a movie like firestorm at least gives you some perspective on how good those movies really were . 

in fact , there's a good chance that some of them are still playing near you . . .

"the "" disney stick-to-what-you-do-best "" rule states that disney's animated features will invariably be sublime but whenever they try their hand at live-action kids' entertainment , they will fail miserably . 

this goes double for occasions when they try to make a live-action adaptation of a popular cartoon ( remember the 1996 version of 101 dalmations ? 

i'm still trying to forget ) . 

that rule proves more dependable than ever with inspector gadget , an insulting , despicable and , worst of all , expensive piece of trash trying to pass itself off as a viable children's film . 

it will bore anyone over five and should prove unbearable for adults , even at its relatively skinny running time of 80 minutes . 

it's films like this that make me want to go to my local blockbuster and rent something from the days when brains were more important than budgets and wit compensated for lack of fancy effects . 

just as matthew broderick began to convince me that there is hope for him as an actor yet , his career takes a nosedive to hell with his "" role "" as john brown , a depressed security guard with a big heart who hopes that one day he can become a real policemen and help the people around him . 

he dreams of heroic deeds and the subsequent admiration of his long time crush , dr . brenda bradford ( joely fisher ) . 

but after a few bizarre coincidences it seems that he has to dream no longer . 

john breaks every bone in his body while trying to save dr . brenda's father . 

dr . brenda has been working on a "" gadget project , "" which would make a half-man half-machine super-policeman to fight crime . 

feeling indebted to john she decides to save his life by making him the subject , realizing his dream of becoming a policeman . 

now , when he says "" go go gadget [insert name of gizmo here] "" he can use all kinds of nifty gadgets to capture crooks , bang up bandits and mangle murderers . 

in the meantime , the evil claw ( rupert everett ) , the man responsible for the murder of the good doctor's father is building a gadget of his own : a carbon copy of our inspector gadget except evil and john brown's worst nemesis . 

claw has plans of world domination , which leaves it up to the inspector and his gadget mobile ( voice of d . l . 

hughley ) to save humanity from his wrath . 

state of the art effects fly at a mad pace in this $90 million dollar movie and yet director david kelogg never sets up a convincing atmosphere . 

had they replaced all the fancy gizmos with dollar bills they would have wound up with the same effect . 

what we see on the screen is like the raw ingredients of a meal : all of the expensive f/x amounts to nothing . 

part of the charm of the tv series was its sly irreverence which has gone down the toilet in the condescending movie . 

can kids really admire a hero so goody-two-shoes that he screams "" hey ! 

you ran a stop sign ! "" 

while hanging off the back bumper of a quickly moving vehicle ? 

i think that today's children will respond better to somebody dashing , someone ultra-cool . 

they ( probably ) receive enough preaching from their parents and its an insult to their intelligence to assume that they want to go to an action movie to see a father figure kick butt . 

in addition to the more complex complaints above , there's also the simple stuff : inspector gadget is boring , formulaic and achingly implausible . 

there's no feeling that the director really cares about his story : more than any other film i've seen this year , this one really feels like it was made on an assembly line . 

there's a popular commercial ( for sprite , but that's irrelevant ) running in movie theaters before features that spoofs the way major studios deal with projects . 

it consists of studio suits discussing a fictitious ( thank god ) movie called "" death slug "" . 

each executive gleefully presents a different merchandise tie-in ( slug taco ! 

slug on a stick ! ) . 

at the end one of them asks "" what about the movie ? "" 

another answers : "" well , we don't have a script yet , but we can bang one out by friday . "" 

they probably could have replaced "" death slug "" with inspector gadget . 

this film contains the sort of logical contradictions and blatantly obvious adherence to formula that could have been eliminated had any attention been payed to the script . 

it's no coincidence that most good children's entertainment these days comes from animation . 

animated features take so long to maker that it becomes a labor of love for the filmmakers and they put care and pride into their work . 

these kinds of films are banged out quicker and a good percentage turn out worthless , sloppy and impersonal . 

the studios are becoming factories and films their assembled products .

" "" it was not scary . "" 

these are the first words that came to mind after it was over . 

when a movie is called _vampires_ , "" not scary "" aren't words that should be associated with it . 

but that wasn't my only gripe . 

john carpenter is a name associated with cutting-edge cinema , as in the intense scares of _halloween_ , _the thing_ and _the prince of darkness_ , or the offbeat action of _they live_ and _escape from new york_ . 

unfortunately , the only thing that is cutting edge about _vampires_ is the level of boredom the movie is able to reach . 

with an anemic plot and not-quite-kosher special effects , _john carpenter's vampires_ has barely enough substance to slake the thirst of even the least discerning genre fan . 

the film is at first concerned with a group of roaming vampire slayers , led by james woods , of all people . 

like some sort of holy a-team ( they even have their own souped-up van ) , the bunch invade and wipe out a nest of vampires in a new mexico shack . 

their method is amusingly innovative : the blood-suckers are reeled out with harpoons so they can flare up in the sun like matchsticks . 

to commemorate their victory , the loutish band decorates a motel room with hookers and parties the night away . 

their celebration is short-lived , however , as a master vampire named valek ambushes and single-handedly destroys most of the team . 

woods' jack crow and buddy montoya ( daniel baldwin ) escape with their lives , along with a woman named katrina ( sheryl lee ) . 

although the woman has been bitten , montoya and crow decide to keep katrina for her psychic link to the master vampire . 

the rest of the movie is concerned with the boys' hunt for valek ( thomas ian griffith ) , a freaky marilyn manson-type who's on a mission that dates back 600 years . 

along the way they pick up a priest named guiteau ( tim guinee ) , a character who serves pretty much the same purpose as the jittery cpl . 

upham in _saving private ryan_ . 

some stuff happens in the middle of the movie , but i can't remember most of it , because i often found a twitching hair in the corner of the frame more interesting than what was happening on screen . 

_vampires_ finally starts to pick up about 90 minutes into the mix , as crow , guiteau , and montoya assault an abandoned prison-turned vampire nest . 

only then does the film begin to even resemble a carpenter flick . 

but it's too little too late . 

we get the inevitable final confrontation , but it seems tacked on and rather anti-climactic ( come on , we're dealing with _the_ master vampire here ! ) 

interestingly , last summer's vampire actioner _blade_ was derived from a comic book , and _vampires_ from a novel , yet the latter seems more steeped in campy cheesiness than the former , a more deliberate superhero flick . 

woods' jack crow spouts glib off-the-cuff one-liners and strolls away from exploding buildings with that oh-so-cool stride . 

and his motive for killing vampires ? 

take a wild guess . 

 ( hint : a ______ killed his _____ when he was just a _____ . ) 

at least _blade_ had decent action and slick stylishness . 

_vampires_ lacks even cheap thrills to mask its gossamer-thin plot . 

to make up for this , the movie resorts to other "" shocks , "" such as its generally condescending attitude towards women ( crow slaps them around for the fun of it ) and an overplayed contempt for religion ( crow teases guiteau incessantly about whether his vow of celibacy has made him prone to "" getting woodies . "" ) 

it can be argued that maybe i wanted too much from this movie . 

if not scary and gory , i wanted tense , relentless , and exhausting . 

_john carpenter's vampires_ is none of these . 

i can only recommended it for the hardcore carpenter fan . 

for the rest of you looking for a good scare , beware : _vampires_ is a film with no teeth .

"among multitude of erotic thrillers , that had been released in the early 1990s , woman of desire is interesting only because it was directed by robert ginty , star of the b-grade action films of the previous decade . 

those who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star . 

as director , ginty did very little to improve that impression . 

the protagonist of the movie is jack ( played by jeff fahey ) , yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford ( played by bo derek ) . 

however , she has relationship with rich and powerful jonathan ashby ( steven bauer ) . 

one stormy night , the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder . 

however , his good friend walter j . hill ( robert mitchum ) happens to be very good lawyer , so jack might even prove his innocence in the end . 

belonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller , woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots . 

unfortunately , this film isn't comedy and any laugh is unintentional . 

the characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them . 

the actors that play them don't help either . 

that is especially the case with jeff fahey , whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison . 

his partner bo derek , on the other hand , shows that she didn't age enough to cease being the sex goddess , but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents . 

ginty , on the other hand , tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting , but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer .

"the summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies throughout the year . 

we are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually trashed by critics , loved by the people , and make tons of money at the box office . 

this year , the tradition continues with an update on the universal 1932 classic , the mummy . 

i have always been a sucker for this kind of monster movies , and i always seem to be the only critic who really likes them . 

that tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza . 

in the mummy , the up and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick o'connell . 

he teams up with a curious , clumsy librarian named evelyn , played by rachel weisz , to find the mysterious city of the dead , hamunaptra . 

evelyn loves egypt , and would truly like to visit the city that people call a fable . 

rick has claimed he has been to hamunaptra during a battle , and that's why she chose him to lead her there . 

also tagging along on the journey to the city of the dead is evelyn's brother , jonathan , played by john hannah ( sliding doors ) . 

now in hamunaptra , the three uncover "" the book of the dead . "" 

the curious evelyn unlocks the book , reads from it , and now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep ( arnold vosloo ) becomes alive and is out to kill the ones who opened and read from the book . 

along with imhotep arising from the dead , the ten curses of egypt become in full effect , launching unbelievable forces against the three and another group who set out to find hamunaptra . 

not only is imhotep furious with those who awoke him , he is also out to restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt . 

don't expect huge things out of the mummy , but just expect to have a good time . 

this movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror film with beefed up special effects , which may turn off some viewers . 

on the other hand , this type of film is one of my favorites , but that's up to you to decide . 

there is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about the mummy though . 

the state of the art special effects take you into a completely different world . 

we are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert , swarms of beetles and locusts , and even creatures crawling under a human's skin . 

these may have been in other movies before , but not like in the mummy . 

as of now , the mummy holds the title for best special effects of this year , but all this could change when star wars episode 1 : the phantom menace is released into theaters across the country . 

in the past , brendan fraser has played mainly comedic roles . 

when playing "" george "" in disney's george of the jungle , he was mainly not known by anyone . 

i would say that gods and monsters is the film that gave him a name , and now the mummy will give him a name amongst teens . 

in the mummy , fraser gets to play an action hero , and i liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role , as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle . 

although brendan fraser is great , rachel weisz gives the best performance among the cast . 

weisz really reminded me of a character from an old , horror film . 

the way she acts , looked , and talked all reminded me of someone not from this time . 

evelyn is probably the only character that was likable , considering that the other characters , like john hannah's , didn't get much personal attention . 

in many films , when different genres are mixed , the mixing usually works , and i like it for the most part . 

in the mummy though , not all of the mixing works . 

there are some scenes that have a lot of potential horror , some with potential comedy , some with potential drama , and some with potential pure action , but the film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to work . 

the mummy could have gotten an "" a "" rating from me if it had gone purely with one of these . 

i didn't mind the corny one-liners here and there during action sequences , but it certainly could have done without them . 

the cinematography is amazing in the mummy . 

particularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt , we are taken into a very fun portrayal of egypt , mummies , and the treasures left behind by the ancient egyptians . 

the costume design in the film is also up there with the great cinematography . 

from ancient egyptians outfits to original troops outfits , the costumes are always top notch . 

the bottom line- with the mummy , the summer is off to its usually great start .

"dear god , this is a fantastically bad film ! 

regardless of what i say about knock off , you can't grasp its awfulness from my words . 

you have to see it and experience it for yourself . 

here's the kicker , though -- i suggest that you do so . 

yes , this is a bad film -- easily one of the most incompetent films of the year -- but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure . 

in fact , i enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time , despite the dreadful acting and a completely incomprehensible story . 

don't get me wrong : i'm not excusing knock off . 

it reaches an unacceptable level of badness ; it's so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was . 

it also features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon , michael wong , paul sorvino , and -- of course -- jean-claude van damme . 

it does , however , have the entertaining presence of rob schneider , and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark . 

as i watched it , i occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness . 

now , in retrospect , it seems clear that it wasn't , but it's still a fascinating kind of mess . 

i don't like writing plot descriptions ( it is , by far , the most boring part of writing a review ) , but , in this case , i'm off the hook : there is no way i could write an accurate synopsis for knock off . 

for the sake of comparison , i had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing . 

i paid closer attention to knock off , and the only thing i am able to say about it is that van damme plays a dude named ray , and is accused by the cia ( i think ) of selling knock off products ( knock off products are , of course , products that look like name-brand materials but are generic and cheap ) . 

i don't know what any of this has to do with martial arts , but there are lots of martial arts in the film . 

ray is good at martial arts , so when he has to beat up bad guys , there's no problem . 

rob schneider plays his sidekick , although i had no idea who he really was by the end of the film . 

lela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff , while paul sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once ! 

in fact , every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do . 

in that order , knock off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense . 

but what a strange mess it is . 

it was written by stephen e . de souza , who also wrote die hard and 48 hours . 

can this be the same man ? 

i don't see how , unless , of course , huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time . 

knock off seems to have an interesting premise ( as far as action films go ) , but there's no semblance here . 

for instance , van damme is introduced , and then seconds later he's running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong . 

why ? 

who knows . 

what are the implications of this ? 

i have no idea . 

most action films abandon depth in favor of action , and this is normally a problem . 

knock off , however , is the first film that i would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut . 

the acting is embarrassingly bad : rochon , in particular , delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity . 

sorvino , in addition , deserves better than this . 

van damme is bad , but he's charming in that bad way , and so i can't say that he's hard to watch ( although i rarely understood what he was saying ) . 

the only exception is rob schneider , who is actually quite funny a lot of the time . 

tsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparison . 

they're all pointless gimmicks though , such as shots of the inner-workings of a knock off running shoe . 

but his action scenes are never boring : one particular piece inside of a fruit factory ( a fruit factory ? ) is well-choreographed . 

lots of the scenes are pitched well to comedy , such as our heroes' first encounter with the rochon character . 

but did tsui know that his film is beyond ludicrous ? 

i hope he did , for the alternative is a frightening thought . 

knock off has the feel of a truly terrible exercise in camp mania . 

if it were boring , i'd give it zero stars . 

but it's not boring : it's loud and excessive and completely incoherent . 

it's also funny , even when it isn't meaning to be funny . 

a bad film that succeeds as entertainment doesn't deserve to be fully lambasted . 

i recognize knock off for its irrefutable badness , but i can't deny it's zany , useless charm . 

oh , i know , they're just action scenes looking desperately for a real story , but they're fun action scenes amongst a crowd of laughably inane concepts . 

it's fun to admire the awfulness of a film like this , but that doesn't excuse the fact that it is , indeed , awful . 
"
"we all know the fate of "" child's play , "" which is the same for almost any film these days that does marginally well financially : sequel hell . 

with the newest installment in the quasi-popular series currently out ( that would be "" bride of chucky "" - and it grossed 11 million in its opening weekend , which i think is the sign of the apocalypse number five ) , it's kinda fun to go back and see how it all began rougly ten years ago with the original , a task which is a retread for some , and for others ( namely myself ) a chance to see what all the fuss was about . 

alas , the original "" child's play "" actually isn't that bad . 

even seeing it in the tiny , claustrophobic , and mechanically-challenged theatre at my college wasn't the horribly dull experience i thought it would be , not just because of the nicely rowdy crowd ( which you almost need to watch a film like this - and if you don't believe me , try and watch this flick by yourself one day ) , but because as a whole , this isn't a bad movie . 

it's not great , but it does have two things that many horror films like this one don't have : 1 ) a rather nifty premise , and 2 ) a sense of humor , both which save this from horror hell , which is precisely where , say , "" i know what you did last summer "" has recently gone . 

the premise of "" child's play "" is that a serial killer named charles lee ray ( brad douriff ) is shot and almost killed by a chicago hard-boiled detective ( chris surrandon - see what happens to some oscar nominees ? ) , and before he dies , utters a voodoo chant that sends his soul directly into a kid's doll called chucky , a doll which has got to be the scariest-looking kid's doll i've ever seen . 

the next day , a bum who's stolen it sells it to single-mother karen barclay ( catherine hicks ) , who then gives it to her young son andy ( alex vincent ) for his birthday . 

of course chucky begins talking to the kid and trying to find a way to get out of the doll , but certain twists come up . 

like the guy he learned voodoo from reveals to him that the only way to break the curse is to take over the body of the first person he told he was inside the doll , that being andy . 

and soon enough , chucky is killing people either for revenge or for what seems like fun , and people are discovering that chucky isn't just a kiddie doll one by one . 

the idea is a neat one , ripe for lots of comic terror , and luckily it utlizes a lot of that . 

it plays with an idea stolen from a classic looney toons short that when someone knows that chucky is alive , they tell people about it , but when he tries to prove themselves , chucky does nothing , and everyone thinks they're crazy . 

it plays with this , as well as the whole child-like thought that dolls and toys come to life , and even manages to cram in a couple really frightening moments . 

even if there's an entire sequence devoted to cliches ( a woman alone in a house hears a noise , goes to investigate it , and finds nothing , but wait for the kicker a second later ! ) , 

there's also a harrowing car ride with chucky trying to knife the detective from the back seat , and then trying to attack him when the car finally crashes , leaving the viewer with at least rather visceral exprience . 

the ending is rather fun , as well , albeit a tad too drawn-out ( about four different endings , maybe five ) , and the characters are more intelligent than the average horror film line-up , making them easier to sympathize with . 

if there's one horrible thing about many horror films , it's that the protagonists are morons who you can't help but shout obscenities at , and for the most part , "" child's play "" steers away from that . 

and most of all , the chucky character is a good one , not just because he provides instant comic relief ( look ! 

that doll's moving on its own ! ) , but because he's a generally scary character . 

if there's anything really wrong with "" child's play , "" it's that it's too trite and has too less self esteem . 

at almost 90 minutes , "" child's play "" features way too less to be a real classic of horror . 

it throws itself into a simple three act set-up that renders it quick and almost forgettable if it weren't for the fact that the film deals with a psychotic doll . 

if the film had more confidence in what it was presenting , it would really push the envelope and become even more than just a short bit of horror escapism , which is precisely why this kind of film is only memorable as a cheap little horor film . . . which 

isn't necessarily a bad thing . 

as such , "" child's play "" is content to be just the short , typical horror film , but saves itself via a sense of humor and a nice quasi-campy feel that makes it much more enjoyable than the average short , typical horror film .

"i saw simon birch in a basically sold out theater , on a sunday afternoon . 

when the movie was over and the audience was exiting , i didn't hear one negative comment , and i didn't have any to offer . 

simon birch is primarily about the friendship of two twelve year old boys , simon ( ian michael smith ) and joe ( joseph mazzello ) , and what destiny holds for both of them . 

simon is a dwarf , who was not supposed to last through the night after birth due to a weak heart . 

surprisingly , he does , and now constantly reminds everyone that he is a living miracle . 

simon thinks god has a plan for him , a purpose for his life , and his condition , he just doesn't know what . 

joe is an illegitimate child ( referred to both comically and dramatically throughout the film as a bastard ) , who's mom ( ashley judd ) won't tell him who his father is . 

simon has more than just dwarfism as a problem , the people in the town don't really like him , because he isn't "" natural "" . 

even his own parents don't care about him , and are disappointed they didn't have a "" normal "" son . 

he is also harassed in church by the local pastor , rev . russell ( david strathairn ) and simon's chain smoking sunday school teacher played by jan hooks . 

the only person , other than joe , that really cares for simon is joe's mom , who he also looks up to as a mother . 

it would be just simon's luck , that he would accidentally kills joe's mom , something you are told at the beginning of the movie . 

joe , now motherless as well as fatherless , feels the need to find out who his real father is . 

with the help of ben ( oliver platt ) , the local drama teacher and joe's mom's current boyfriend ( before her death ) , he will attempt to locate his dad and get in a little trouble on the way . 

most of this trouble is laugh out loud funny , although not all of it is . 

simon will also look for god's plan for him , although he loses a little faith along the way . 

starring in the first ( and last ) five minutes of the film is hollywood's newest dramatic actor , jim carrey . 

jim plays the adult version of joe and does a impressive job starting the film off , and then tying it up just right . 

this is the first character jim has played that is not over the top in anyway , and he does a commendable job . 

simon birch is written and directed by mark steven johnson , this is his first film as director , but he has written several films , including the grumpy old men series . 

he does an outstanding writing and directing job here , the film's structure is flawless and its flows together perfectly . 

the dialog goes from extremely funny to morose without missing a beat . 

the cast is excellent . 

joseph mazzello gives the stand out performance . 

joseph is outstanding for someone of any age , not alone someone who just turned 15 . 

ian michael smith , in his film debut , has such a strong physical presence that you believe he is simon without any hesitation . 

other great performances are turned in by the rest of the supporting cast . 

i loved this movie , it is far and away one of the best films i have seen all year . 

take your whole family to see simon birch , it is a magnificent film- an american masterpiece . 
"
"written by john grisham and robert altman ( as al hayes ) 

directed by robert altman 

some time ago , a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel . 

the novel was a summer smash , topping best-seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads . 

the only problem : the novel wasn't very good . 

it was far more pulp than pulitzer . 

but the director realized that , no matter how pedestrian the prose , this book really grabbed people - that the author , while not a great writer , was a fantastic storyteller . 

so he took on the project , convinced he could make something happen on screen . 

the director ? 

francis ford coppola . 

the book , of course , was mario puzo's the godfather . 

the rest , as they say in showbiz , was history . 

by bringing up the godfather , i don't mean to suggest that robert altman's the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness . 

but the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material . 

can you get any more questionable than john grisham ? 

depends on whom you ask . 

but there's no question that grisham's work grabs people . 

like puzo , grisham is a better storyteller than a writer - unlike fellow hack michael crichton , who is a good idea man but who can't tell a well-constructed story from a can of spam . 

so something in grisham's unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman , who at 73 years old remains one of america's greatest living filmmakers . 

the result is a gripping thriller that , while falling short of classic cinema , deserves its place in the altman canon . 

>from its opening shot to the closing credits , the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread , with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe . 

this terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch . 

witness said opening shot : we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing , undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear . 

we roll over the hills into the town of savannah , then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone . 

right away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises . 

pay attention , boys and girls - this shot was not conceived by john grisham , but by altman . 

this is what a great director can do for questionable source material . 

the sports car belongs to rick magruder ( kenneth branagh ) , the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases . 

magruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office . 

outside after the party he meets one of the waitresses , mallory doss ( embeth davidzt ) , just as she realizes her car has been stolen . 

driven by southern chivalry , a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress , magruder offers her a ride home . 

there he learns more about mallory's life than he bargained for . 

her car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon ( robert duvall ) , a ted kyzynski-style whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter . 

magruder , perhaps influenced by mallory's decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him , is sympathetic to her plight , and offers to help her get her father committed - right after he sleeps with her , of course . 

this simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end . 

he succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital , and for a moment all appears well . 

but then dixon's crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup - and suddenly magruder finds himself , mallory and his own children in danger . 

the cops won't lift a finger to help a liberal attorney . 

his only allies are his faithful assistant lois ( daryl hannah ) and his bumbling private-eye sidekick clyde ( robert downey jr ) . 

if this predicament wasn't bad enough , hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos . 

altman may provide the atmosphere , but branagh's performance holds the gingerbread man together . 

an accomplished actor when he isn't directing himself in vanity productions , branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives . 

is his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness , or of egotism ? 

magruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it - and by then it's too late . 

as the plot unfolds , magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are . 

and life is never so bad that it can't get worse . 

if you're familiar with altman's work , you'll recognize several of his signature techniques . 

characters are not introduced in establishing shots , but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent . 

crucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows , making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action . 

dialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style . 

and of course there's my favorite altman technique - the obligatory nude actress shot . 

thanks to altman , here are some of the actresses i've had the pleasure of seeing naked : sally kellerman , julianne moore , madeline stowe , even frances mcdormand . 

and now i can add embeth davidtz , who looks quite healthy in the altogether . 

the naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film . 

is it old-school sexism , or a clever in-joke ? 

you be the judge . 

but back to the picture at hand . 

in the hands of a mere mortal , the gingerbread man would have been a routine thriller , no better or worse than the countless others we've all endured . 

in the hands of a master like altman , it becomes an exercise in existential doom , in its own way far more successful than scorsese's cape fear remake , which tried for the same result . 

what may prevent it from enduring with altman's greatest work is a weak third act - in fact , there really is no third act in grisham's story , so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up . 

but there are true moments of riveting suspense , and great performances by branagh , davidzt and downey jr - more than enough to see you through . 

that polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman , and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back , should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are . 

they probably wanted it to look more like a time to kill . 

and that , my friends , should make you very afraid . 
"
"plot : a rich psychiatrist with a great home life gets his cute daughter kidnapped by some bad guys who want him to extract some information from the mind of one of his nutty patients . 

of course , the patient is not cooperative and the doctor only has a few hours to comply with their demands , before they kill his daughter . 

pretty good premise , no ? 

critique : if you're not a fan of movies packed with plot holes , inconsistencies and yes , even more plot holes , heed my words and skip this hollow thriller . 

and i don't like saying that either , since this film actually had some potential and started off pretty well . 

sure , the story is basically just an amalgamation of ransom , primal fear and nick of time pureed into one , but the whole "" psychiatrist working against the clock "" thing , actually had me engaged at first . 

but it's at about the halfway mark of this movie , that the bottom drops out and all that we're left with are a lot of questions and very few plausible answers . 

we get the overly smart kid who manages to "" pull one "" over on the bad guys . 

we get a weak woman with her leg in a cast beating the crap out of a tough bad guy . 

we get douglas' character , a new york uppedity psychiatrist , suddenly turning into an action hero , with moves and attitude to boot . 

and what about the film's main plot point ? 

why would the bad guys still give a crap about this thing after 10 years , and even more so , why would they only give the shrink until the day's end to do his part ? 

 ( you waited 10 years , what's another few days ? - or why not set up another heist instead ? ) . 

i'll tell you why , it's because we wouldn't have a ( bad ) movie otherwise , that's why ! 

and many , many more . 

ugh , whatever the case , it was just about the time that douglas' character suddenly removed murphy's character from the mental home ( and how come she went with him so nicely ? 

i thought she didn't trust him ) , that i turned to my buddy and asked when the movie had turned into a joke . 

and a few bogus chase and action sequences later , we were left with a long-winded ending that did little to answer any other questions i might've still had , and actually brought up even more contradictions . 

badly put together , this movie features some decent acting , some nice cinematography and an initially interesting premise , but loses it all in a haze of plot miscues which ultimately leave you with little care for anyone . 

in fact , if it wasn't for brittany murphy's excellent portrayal of a traumatized teen , jennifer esposito's embarrassing performance as a police woman ( yeah , right ! 

watching her delivering lines was the funniest part of this flick- but it wasn't supposed to be ) and michael douglas' cool "" regular guy "" part , there would be little reason to remain seated until the end of this picture . 

incidentally , can anyone please give me one good reason why esposito's character was in this movie in the first place ? 

she was completely superfluous . 

and on top of all that , by the end of this flick , the director seems to have realized how dumb the audience must be to have bought most of the garbage that he'd been shoveling out for the hour and a half prior , and decides to add insult to injury by flashing back to an earlier character's death when one of the bad guys dies , just so we know ( as an audience ) , that the two are interrelated somehow . 

ooooh , thanks , mr . fleder . . . i 

appreciate the spoon-feeding , dude . . . yum , 

yum . . . but 

how about explaining every other plot point in your film that made no sense ? 

whatever . 

either way , i don't give a rat's ass because this movie is a dog and that's unfortunate because it actually did have some good points going for it . 

see it if you like dumb thrillers . 

incidentally , if you appreciated along came a spider , you will likely enjoy this film as well . 

they both start off with interesting premises , only to toss all logic and sense out the window about halfway through . 

where's joblo coming from ? 

along came a spider ( 4/10 ) - girl , interrupted ( 5/10 ) - kiss the girls ( 7/10 ) - primal fear ( 7/10 ) -- seven ( 10/10 ) 
"
"i wish i could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of a sports film . 

i bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying , "" it would be a very light comedic version of any given sunday , and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of gene hackman as the tough but determined coach . 

throw in that hunk of a guy keanu reeves and a cast of wacky characters and poof ! 

we'll have a hit on our hands ! "" 

the replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film , a mishmash collage of one-dimensional characters , rampant stereotypes of cultures and races , cliched emotional statements of purpose , and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography . 

the story is loosely based around the pro football players' strike in 1987 and a rag-tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels . 

keanu reeves stars as shane falco , a has-been football college player looking for redemption . 

gene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers . 

rounding out the cast includes swingers' jon favreau , 7-up pitchman orlando jones , gruff owner jack warden , and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters : the drunken welshman , the overweight sumo wrestler , the black convict , the violent cop , and the dumb , dumb cheerleaders . 

this bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays , gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is , keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field , and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from denny's . 

the usual things happen like clockwork . 

the hero rises from the ashes of failure , the team comes together in unity , the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest , the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap , and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax . 

it's also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks . 

howard deutch , who was behind the camera for two of the best films of '80s - pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful , has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes . 

obviously the problem is that without a good script , any director will fail in the end . 

sports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory , gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds , the rise and fall of gallant heroes , and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life . 

the replacements offers none of this . 
"
"as i write the review for the new hanks/ryan romantic comedy you've got mail , i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet . 

i am also aware that i have just spent the last 2 hours watching the world's biggest paid commercial for america online . 

and i wonder : is that so bad ? 

well , the commercial part is . 

as for the movie , well , as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan , i think i'll be okay . 

to paraphrase james berardinelli , whose reviews i admire very much , tom hanks and meg ryan can act . 

they are both wonderful , but for all of hanks' glorious work in serious films , such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan , and his glorious triumph in philadelphia , i like him best when he's suitably obnoxious . 

tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when he's going to get the girl : the only question is how ? 

meg ryan , america's high school sweetheart , can act . 

she's had a handful of memorable performances , including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally ( i must not mention what she does , due to the , well , um , you get the idea , and if you don't , get the movie-- fantastic ) . 

but , i like her best when she's , well , perky . 

she is so adorably perky/cute that together with hanks , they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime . 

some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples , but i don't really know . 

all i know is that i just like them both . 

they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that's really hard to resist , and i'm not going to even try . 

they're just really , really cute , sweet , and charming . 

hanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron , who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle . 

here , the setup is a little different . 

kathleen kelly ( ryan ) owns a small children's bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago and passed down to her . 

she is successful , beautiful , and dates a well-known columnist with very radical idea ( kinnear ) . 

she is also having an affair , of sorts . 

you see , kathleen , with the handle shopgirl , is secretly emailing ny152 . 

they have a strictly un-detailed relationship : there are no specifics , and they have no idea who each other is . 

ny152 happens to be joe fox ( hanks ) , a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega-bookstores , run by his father ( coleman ) . 

fox books has decided to open a store on the west side , right across from a little children's bookseller named "" shop around the corner "" , run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly . 

every morning , these two email each other silly , and every day , they fight "" to the death ! ! "" . 

it's a charming premise , and one that works nicely , balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have . 

it also has the great sense of being a classic romance : there is no "" let's have sex tonight "" mantra , if you'll excuse my bluntness . 

this is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love . 

hmm . well , the movie goes through twists and turns , having some sad moments and happy ones , until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan "" hook up "" , to use modern terminology , and kiss their way into happiness . 

you know it's going to happen , the question is now ? 

thankfully , ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey , kinnear , chappelle , and a host of others , including a great scene involving brothers , aunts , and two sweet kids . 

it's all cute and wonderful , and for all of the idealism , it makes me feel good . 

hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is . 

he is , i believe , america's greatest actor . 

does he show it here ? 

nah . 

but he's still tom hanks , and she's still meg ryan . 

which is what this movie boils down to . 

it's pure confection . 

all the bits about the godfather , the jokes , the superb script , it's all really sweet . 

there are some immense flaws , like pacing . 

the last third of the movie really doesn't work as well as i would have liked , and for a romantic comedy , it's slow . 

once hanks knows the secret , it gets really slow . 

i even looked at my watch a couple times , to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for , so that i could get home at a reasonable hour . 

the other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated . 

e-mail ? 

when my kids are my age , i don't know what we'll be using . 

but hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody , and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history . 

they just work together , and it's nice to see . 

it gives you , well , a smile . 

the script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious , and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake . 

i was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was . 

i've always believed that movies are very powerful , very powerful indeed . 

you see , mankind has three abilities he needs to survive : the ability to think , entertain , and procreate . 

movies can definitely do the first two , and as for the third , well , i'd rather not think about that . 

i always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint , and that films that entertained you were good , because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for a night . 

and i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had . 

hanks was the driving force behind one of the year's best films in saving private ryan , which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world . 

he's also half of the glue behind the year's best example of pure entertainment . 

tom hanks and meg ryan are magical , as is this movie . 

it's a sweet , lovely affair with a technology twist . 

it may be a long commercial , but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face . 
"
"felix ( sami bouajila , "" the siege "" ) lives a contented life with his boyfriend daniel ( pierre-loup rajot ) in the little town of dieppe in northern france . 

when he is laid off from his job , after discovering the address of the father who abandoned him before he was born , he decides to journey to marseilles , in the south , to find the man he never met in "" the adventures of felix . "" 

writers/directors olivier ducastel and jacques martineau made their debut with the musical comedy "" jeanne and the perfect guy , "" embracing that typically american genre . 

their second effort , "" the adventures of felix , "" once again borrows from america with a tale of a young man who hits the road to find himself . 

felix is happy with his life in dieppe , but when the ferry company he works for falls prey to the economics of the chunnel , he is out of a job and at loose ends . 

when he goes through his late mother's papers he learns that the father he never knew is living in marseilles , hundreds of miles away . 

felix makes the snap decision to journey to the south , puts together a supply of "" cocktails "" for his hiv virus , kisses daniel goodbye and heads off on foot . 

he refuses to use trains and wants to avoid big cities as he hitchhikes across france to find his destiny . 

along the way , a series of chance encounters with various strangers teaches felix that family is not always made up of blood relations . 

on the road , he witnesses a race-related mugging that turns into murder and , frightened for his own safety , runs away without telling the police . 

following this harrowing experience , he has his first chance meeting that begins the unconscious construction of his ideal family . 

his journey brings him to rouen , and the film's first title section , "" my little brother , "" where he meets jules , a young art student who becomes smitten with felix . 

they steal a car and develop a chaste , brotherly affection before felix must move on . 

he next meets elderly mathilde ( patachou ) , in the chapter titled "" my grandmother , "" and soon learns that she , too , has a fondness for the same tv soap opera that felix has grown addicted to . 

she wants him to stay with her , but he must continue on his way to find his father . 

in the weakest chapter of felix's road trip , titled "" my cousin , "" he meets a railroad worker ( philippe garziano ) and has a brief sexual encounter before heading off , once again , toward marseilles . 

he next helps a stranded lady motorist , isabelle ( ariane ascaride ) , and shags a ride with her and her three kids ( each with a different daddy ) in the sequence titled "" my sister . "" 

he is torn by the inner turmoil of not going to the police about the murder he witnessed and isabelle comforts him just as a sister would . 

on the final leg of the journey titled "" my father , "" he meets an older man , a fisherman ( maurice benichou ) , who enlightens him about the real facts of life and family while they fly felix's kite , just like a father and son . 

 "" the adventures of felix "" has a number of things going for it as we follow felix on his journey of discovery . 

first and foremost is the charming performance by sami bouajila as felix . 

he is a likable guy , fighting his hiv with his doses of "" cocktails , "" and lights up the screen as he makes the long walk , often with dance and song , to find his father and himself . 

as he encounters each member of his new family , promising each that he will send a postcard when he arrives at his final destination , he grows a little bit more spiritually and emotionally . 

bouajila does a terrific job holding center stage on the screen . 

the cast of characters making up felix's new-found family are nearly as charming as the star , each in their own way . 

patachou , especially , is wonderful as the grandma character and a kindred spirit to felix . 

ariane ascaride , along with her kids , gives a perf that really makes you think of her as the sister that the young man never had . 

only the "" cousin "" chapter lacks the emotional depth of the rest and feels like a perfunctory addition to felix's "" family . "" 

 "" the adventures of felix "" does not reinvent the road movie , but it does provide a charismatic telling of a young man's journey to find himself and , to his surprise , his discovery is dramatically different than he expected at the beginning . 

it helps that cinematographer matthieu poirot-delpech's crisp lensing compliments the story perfectly as felix moves across the french countryside . 

i give it a b+ .

"tarzan chad'z = good ) 1999 , g , 90 minutes [1 hour , 30 minutes] [animated - adventure/drama] starring the voices of : tony goldwyn ( tarzan ) , minnie driver ( jane porter ) , lance henriksen ( kerchak ) , brian blessed ( clayton ) ; written by tab murphy , bob tzudiker , noni white ; produced by bonnie arnold ; directed by chris buck , kevin lima ; based on the story `tarzan of the apes' and characters created by edgar rice burroughs . 

seen july 4 , 1999 at 7 : 15 p . m . at crossgates cinemas 18 ( guilderland , ny ) , theater #9 , by myself for free using my hoyts season pass . 

[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture and seats] 

title : `tarzan' beautiful to look at , easy to follow . 

review : disney continues its trend of producing animated summer blockbuster movies meant mostly for children but with enough wit and charm for adults to be interested and at least entertained by the story . 

the basic premise is the same as every other `tarzan' story : a boy is raised in the african jungle by gorillas and becomes one himself never really understanding ( or even noticing ) that he's human and is a lot different from the animals he befriends . 

the first third of the film shows how tarzan comes to be adopted by kala ( voiced by glen close ) , a female gorilla who lost her own child in a classic case of darwanism . 

her mate , kerchak ( henriksen ) , is a mean , conservative leader of the pack of gorillas who make up tarzan's extended family . 

he refuses to acknowledge tarzan ( voiced by alex d . linz during the childhood scenes ) as a son and often has to hold himself back from killing tarzan after he continually does dangerous , wild things that are the result of his own childish instincts . 

i have a feeling children will quickly be able to identify with tarzan since all he really is is just a kid who wants to have fun and it's funny how the adults fail to comprehend this . 

later , as the story transitions from tarzan as a child to a full-grown man ( voiced by goldwyn ) , he is encounter by a party of three humans from england : jane porter ( driver ) , a beautiful woman who is something of a zoologist and an artist , her father prof . archimedes q . porter ( voiced by nigel hawthorne ) who is also a scientist ; and their slick and cunning , yet barbaric safari bodyguard clayton ( blessed ) . 

it's easy to tell where the story is going at all times but the screenplay doesn't seem like it was written hastily nor dumbed down for children's enjoyment . 

sure there's a lot of cliche stuff here , like clayton's smugness and diabolical manipulation of tarzan and jane ; the goofy supporting characters ( voiced by rosie o'donnell [in full brooklyn accent ! ] and wayne knight - `hello newman ! ' ) . 

there's also a lot of fun action such as tarzan's swinging through the jungle on vines and sliding down and around tree branches and trunks . 

it's just like skateboarding really fast and doing all sorts of tricks ( those mcdonald's commercials really prove this point ) . 

ultimately , you get exactly out of `tarzan' what you expect . . . 

and i mean that as a compliment , so have high expectations . 

pros : animation and sound are a feast for the senses , story is lighthearted , breezy and not dumbed-down , no stupid sing-along songs to get stuck in your head . 

cons : surprisingly violent , should have been rated pg . 

young children may not understand some of the more adult themes ( parents , be ready to have some heavy questions thrown your way ) . 

running time is a bit short . 

would you recommend this to friends ? 

not to my friends , but to the movie-going public i would . 

score : or with no 0 rating ) . 
"
"first impressions : critically , a close-to-awful film , but money-wise , it has been doing ( and will continue to do ) great . 

a sometimes-funny film that sags and lags and oftentimes gets boring . 

an orginal plot that grows old real fast . 

one of the only 90 minute films that i've gotten bored through . 

men in black has defied the odds . 

when i first saw that the flick was 89 minutes long , i thought maybe that this was a poor attempt at an independence day type film that just ran out of gas . 

however , i now realize that not only did men in black run out of gas , but the film in 90 minutes manages to show off a very original idea ( which summer audiences have embraced ) that becomes old about 25 minutes into the movie . 

tommy lee jones and will smith play two "" government "" agents who are responsible for keeping order in alien society . 

the ridiculous plot begins when an alien "" bug "" , played weirdly by vincent d'onofrio , who was so great in full metal jacket , lands on earth to retrieve a galaxy that's somewhere on "" orion's belt . "" 

anyway , the basic plot revolves around jones and smith to stop this bug from getting the galaxy , or a higher power will blow up the earth . 

the premise is ridulous , but that is not why i didn't like this film . 

i love original plots . 

this one had an original one . 

but director barry sonnenfeld did something to this film that ruined its plot : he made the film drag and also put in unncessary elements in it that are found in romance films . 

whenever i saw d'onofrio's bug stomp and eat people in the film , it got terribly boring after a while . 

while smith's wise-cracks did fill in the gaps , it wasn't enough . 

and also , i cannot believe the screenwriters elected to have a sub-plot where tommy lee jones missed his former lover because as an alien agent , they can't have contact with any humans really . 

and here i see jones , at a satellite computer , watching his lover plant the garden ? 

a sentimental moment in an alien movie ? 

nice try , but i don't think so . 

it doesn't work here . 

it just makes the movie even more ridiculous and even more boring : we don't only have aliens to worry about , but now we have jones's conscience . 

i came into the movie not wanting to see jones's conscience , but wanting to see a real action movie that had lots of aliens in it . 

maybe it's unfair that i partly judged this movie on what my expectations were . 

nevertheless , even though some parts are indeed funny , the plot in this movie grew old and boring -- quick . 
"
"i can hear the question already . 

what on earth do these two movies have in common ? 

to most people , not a lot , except that both are by renowned directors . 

as i saw them , however , both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers . 

but oh , how differently the packages affect their films . 

while "" everyone's "" production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special , jane campion's imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous and uninvolving laura jones' script is . 

i left "" everyone says i love you "" not remembering a lot about who loved whom , but its infectious happiness put a grin on my face . 

i left "" the portrait of a lady "" not remembering a lot about who loved whom , and i could have cared less . 

 "" everyone "" features nothing allen hasn't done before storywise . 

woody is again desperately in love with a beautiful woman ( roberts ) , and against the odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrong--again . 

similar situations happen to his family and friends . 

some of the more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back to his "" early , funny "" films . 

the scenes between tim roth and drew barrymore could have come out of "" take the money and run , "" his directorial debut . 

however , nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this one-of-a-kind display of sheer good spirits . 

in fact , in this movie , the feeling itself is what's most important . 

yes , the movie would have been better--among his very best , i think--if it had a meatier story . 

but what it lacks in substance it makes up for in feeling . 

and what better way to express feeling than through music ? 

love is often best expressed in a song , and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight to the heart . 

some are a tad too goofy , such as the number where a lot of ghosts prance around in a funeral parlor , but i admired allen for even putting them in there . 

it also helps that as usual , allen has a top-flight cast working with him . 

their singing voices range from quite good ( goldie hawn ) to not quite good ( allen ) to literally unlistenable ( barrymore , whose real voice was dubbed by a professional ) . 

but while their vocal abilities differ , all the actors do a great job of putting joy up there on the screen , and making it rub off on the audience . 

granted , some people will simply never accept characters singing in movies , but for those attuned to it , this film should work wonders . 

jane campion , too , has a top-flight cast working for her in "" portrait of a lady , "" too , but even their considerable skills can do nothing to keep the film from being a stilted , virtually lifeless mess , albeit a visually interesting one . 

campion and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with a great variety of eye-filling images that linger in the mind . 

unfortunately , what didn't linger in the mind for me was the story the visuals were supposed to be reflecting . 

i remember very well shots of a train with its light beaming and shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman , but i can remember very little of what happened between all these people . 

even worse , i don't find myself feeling bad that i've forgotten . 

the problem , i think , lies not with the cast , which seemed to be trying very hard for the material . 

it was the script that couldn't convince me to care about anyone . 

the characters were putting out all kinds of emotion , but i found no reason to connect with any of them . 

i understood that the story was about cold , emotionally vacant characters , but for me to care about them , i have to identify with them somehow and want them to inject feeling into their lives . 

jones' script never simply gave me that opportunity . 

in the end , it almost seemed as if campion was trying to inject some life of her own into the proceedings with her visual flourishes . 

unfortunately , as she kept painting these dazzling pictures , they only served to push me further away from the material and remind me that there was no connection between me and the film . 

in the end , the movie's one strength ended up hurting it . 

so here we have two films with pretty uninteresting plots , and yet i was able to truly enjoy one of them . 

why ? 

with both films , my head cared about neither story , but only "" everyone says i love you "" was able to make my heart sing .

"synopsis : bobby garfield ( yelchin ) lives in a small town with his mirthless widowed mother ( hope davis ) . 

bobby's world revolves around his friends , especially the spritely carol ( boorem ) . 

then one day , a new boarder arrives at bobby's house . 

ted brautigan ( hopkins ) is an enigmatic man to whom bobby takes an immediate liking . 

as the bond between bobby and ted deepens , bobby becomes privy to ted's great secret , an event which will change both of their lives forever . 

review : a small but enchanting movie , "" hearts in atlantis "" easily recalls another king-inspired coming-of-age film , "" stand by me "" , both in terms of its setting and the sentiment it conveys . 

 "" hearts "" is a tribute to the magic of childhood , to those summers when the days seem neverending , and nothing means more than your closest friends . 

unlike "" stand by me "" , there is a supernatural element to "" hearts "" , but although it is key to the plot , it is not prominent . 

like "" stand by me "" , this is a mostly character-driven film , and as such it benefits greatly from superb casting . 

yelchin is very good as bobby , finding a good mix of innocence and resignation . 

more splendid still is boorem , whom i praised highly for her work in "" along came a spider "" and who is simply radiant here as carol . 

and then there is hopkins , who despite playing such a quiet , introspective character as ted , nonetheless commands our attention every time he is onscreen . 

less successful is davis , whose strident elizabeth comes across as overly cartoonish . 

i also found it odd that bobby and carol's other friend , sully ( whose death as an adult sets up the movie's flashback framing device ) , is paid virtually no attention . 

but hicks' direction is lovely without being cloying , and despite the movie's general lack of incident , it never ceases to weave its spell over the audience . 
"
"some concepts seem patently hopeless from the beginning , a live-action version of mr . 

magoo being a prime example . 

the cartoon figure mr . magoo , the bumbling blind man , can be quite funny , but only in small doses and only within the confines of animated images . 

if you think naked gun star leslie nielsen is a dubious choice to play the role of the short guy who runs into walls , you are right , but there is an even more astonishing selection . 

for a director they tapped hong kong's stanley tong , whose resume consists mainly of a handful of movies featuring martial arts expert jackie chan . 

the story , such that there is one , is about a large , stolen ruby , which looks a woolworth reject . 

mr . magoo gets it and , of course , does not realize he has it . 

mayhem then ensues as the bad and the good guys chase each other with mr . magoo frequently oblivious to the fact that anyone is being chased . 

like home alone 3 but without any class , mr . 

magoo can only be described as painfully bad . 

fifteen minutes of it feels like an eternity . 

the movie's humor is pathetically lame , and the pacing is way off . 

when one is stuck in a theater for an hour and a half watching what claims to be a motion picture , one looks for some solace . 

mr . 

magoo provides only three such moments . 

the movie begins and ends with the classic cartoon version of the character , who exudes his usual charm . 

the only other saving grave in the movie itself is angus , the sweet little bulldog . 

angus demonstrates more genuine emotions and a wider acting range than any of the humans in the picture . 

finally , the ending credits contain outtakes of the movie , which have some of the genuineness and spontaneity that the movie badly lacked . 

rather than attempt to adapt mr . magoo to a non-cartoon movie , nielsen makes the strategic mistake of trying to literally be a human version of the cartoon . 

he has trouble sustaining the squinting eyes and the affected voice , and even when he does it comes off as awkwardly unfunny . 

my wife managed to get some sleep during the movie , but i was not so lucky . 

hopefully , this picture will force producers to think harder about which subjects have promise and which do not . 

mr . magoo runs 1 : 37 . 

it is rated pg for comic violence and would be acceptable for all ages . 

my son jeffrey , age 8 , said he thought the movie was good and really funny , but recommends you not choose it if you want an action movie . 

he said he liked home alone 3 much more . 

his friend maxim , age 9 , said that he thought it was good but very silly and parts did not make sense . 

his other friend nickolas , age 8 , said he'd give the movie * * * 1/2 , but that it was really silly .

"bruce willis stars as malcolm , an award winning child psychologist who discovers one night that one of his former patients is still suffering from inner demons . 

the now grown man breaks into his apartment while he and his wife ( olivia williams from rushmore ) are celebrating his award , shoots malcolm in the stomach , then takes his own life . 

almost nine months later , malcolm discovers cole ( haley joel osment , in a brilliant performance ) , another young man afflicted with the same turmoil as his former patient . 

he takes on the child's case in the hope of redeeming himself for botching up the previous one , alienating his wife in the process . 

he soon discovers that they boy can see and speak to the dead , and his life becomes forever turned upside down . 

although the first hour is very slow , the sixth sense turns out to be a very powerful and moving film . 

i was expecting this film to be mercury rising 2 , but was astonished to discover an extremely well plotted out little thriller with an outstandingly satisfying ending . 

you'll find yourself mentally retracing your steps through the film to see if you actually saw what you think you did once the credits roll . 

i must give m . night shyamalan a lot of credit for a brilliantly written screenplay . 

the cast should also be given a lot of credit for making the movie as solid as it is . 

a lesser cast could have made this film a joke . 

bruce willis portrays his character perfectly , balancing his need to help cole and his agony over his strained relationship with his wife skillfully . 

haley joel osment shines as nine year old cole , showing patience in his character that few young actors these days can pull off . 

toni collette , looking markedly different from her pathetic character in muriel's wedding , gives a strong performance as cole's mother , who is trying to cope with both her son's "" illness "" and the passing of her mother . 

finally , olivia williams deftly portrays a woman having to struggle with a husband who's not around and flirtations with a co-worker that could lead to a begrudgingly accepted end . 

it's a shame that they show cole's abilities in the trailer , because the movie takes close to forty minutes to get around to doing the same , so we already know what's going on before most of the rest of the cast does . 

in retrospect though , the forty minute set-up is essential to enjoying the end of the film , so i have fewer complaints now then i did while i was watching the film . 

i'm glad that the run of teen-styled horror films has passed and filmmakers are starting to make more adult fare . 

films like this , the similarly themed stir of echoes , and countless others to be released later in the year should make for a pretty entertaining close to 1999 . 

[pg-13] 
"
"there was a lot riding on this movie . 

everyone even moderately interested in the "" scream "" series was dying to know how it would end . 

what would be the "" final act "" ? 

this is the end of an era for them , a movie which has kept them up nights searching for clues on the internet , talking and tossing around rumors with their equally enthused buddies , and , for kids under 17 , those elaborate plots consisting of buying a ticket to one movie and hopping into "" scream "" while narrowly escaping those menacing ushers who are only a year or two older than themselves . 

no need to worry ; "" scream 3 "" is endlessly inventive and entertaining , a fine epilogue to the series that made kevin williamson a household name , reinvented the horror genre , and continued in the self-referential , post-modern tradition of quentin and co . 

so , how does the story go ? 

as opposed to what some fanatical internet sites would have you believe , sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , now all-grown-up and constantly dealing with her pass in the constantly tormented sector of her psyche , is not living in hollywood fulfilling her dream to become an actress , but rather in upstate california , living , understandably , alone in the confines of fences and vast security systems . 

she works at home as a crisis center affiliate over the phone . 

but that ? ? ? s not where the movie starts off . 

instead , in a tactic that reminded me of the somewhat similar , and conceptually horrifying , sequence in "" eye for an eye "" ( 1995 ) , cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , now a big star , drives home to his girlfriend in traffic when the killer calls , demands the location of sidney ? ? ? s home , and , when he doesn ? ? ? t get it , threatens the life of cotton ? ? ? s girlfriend christine , and cotton can ? ? ? t do anything to stop him . 

the rest of the sequence is particularly clever , setting up a constant throughout the picture : the killer has a high-tech electronic voice-changer that tops that of the first two . 

not only does he sound unmistakably like talented voice-over artist roger jackson ( ha , ha ) , he can now easily duplicate the voices of the lead characters , including sidney , and the returned gale weathers ( courtney cox arquette ) and dewey riley ( david arquette ) . 

at the same time , stab 3 , the third film-within-a-film based around the characters and events of woodsboro and windsor college , has taken a less authentic approach this time around in return to woodsboro ; whereas the account of the first two films was true , the franchise within "" scream "" has now become totally fictional . 

nevertheless , we learn , cotton made an appearance in the movie which is now in production , as himself to be killed off in the first scene . 

so , it seems that the real killer is offing our heroes in the order in which they bite it in the movie ? ? 'either the actor portraying them , or the real thing . 

sometimes both . 

clever , indeed . 

but , who goes next ? 

no one knows . 

three different scripts were penned , we ? ? ? re told , to keep the true finale off the internet ( a nod to the "" scream "" 2 fiasco a few years back ) and no one knows for sure which one the killer read . 

still , all the while sidney stays concealed in her home , only visiting dad for the first half-hour of the film , while also having horrifying visions of her mother , which takes us back a bit to sidney ? ? ? s fear of becoming what her mother was ? ? 'or , at least , what her mother was secretly . 

when sidney finally ventures out to hollywood as the murders become more prevalent , she ? ? ? s chased onto the set of stab 3 , wandering through "" woodsboro , "" written and directed as an odd , surreal , nightmare indeed , this is one of "" scream 3 "" ? ? ? s finest moments . 

okay , over the years , i ? ? ? ll admit that i ? ? ? ve become quite the "" scream "" fan . 

no , i don ? ? ? t have the ghostface costume or the director ? ? ? s cut laserdisc , but i often find myself compelled to pop in the dvd of either member of the preceding duo , and can get quite caught up in the dramatic element of these films ( yes , i said "" dramatic element "" ) , sometimes debating with family and friends the possibilities and endless theories that have become quintessentially affiliated with "" scream "" . 

throughout the film , though , i noticed a much more subtle approach than the other two films . 

granted that there ? ? ? s stabbin-a-plenty going on throughout , but there ? ? ? s considerably less blood , less gore . 

honestly , i like this approach . 

it ? ? ? s more classical , more rebellious , constantly demonstrating the capable direction of wes craven . 

he knows when to hold back and at the same time makes the movie ooze with energy , illustrating the delicate poise flowing from his years of experience . 

some critics have noted that "" scream 3 "" seems to take itself more seriously this time ; maybe so , or maybe screenwriter ehren kruger ( arlington road ) , who took over after williamson had scheduling conflicts , saw an opportunity for true irony ? ? 'maybe even a little bit of satire ? ? 'if the film worked in a few more clich ? ? s . 

what puts a damper on this otherwise exceptional and creative film , i ? ? ? m afraid , is the ending , or , rather , the identity of the killer . 

it does the job , i guess , accomplishes what it should , bringing the three films full circle , but upon my first viewing it seemed rather dissatisfying because it appears a little too contrived , too arbitrary ; after a second viewing , which i endeavored upon due to this recurring disapprobation , the killer ? ? ? s identity still seems a little too random , but his motivation came across more sound this time around , and the eventual conclusion was ultimately more satisfying . 

all in all , "" scream 3 "" does not fall victim to the most lamented principle of a trilogy : it is not the worst of the films . 

as a trilogy , "" scream "" was a lot of fun ; refreshing , humorous , offbeat . 

almost sad to see it go . 

but then , it does seem best to quit while you ? ? ? re ahead , and "" scream 3 "" does a fine job of providing closure to its characters . 

for now , "" scream "" holds the title as the finest series of horror films to be committed to celluloid . 

not too shabby . 
"
"with many big-budget science fiction films , great ideas are often wasted by bad scripts , cheesy plot twists , and , terrible acting . 

the fifth element , the abyss , and godzilla had great concepts squandered by bad acting , writing , or both . 

at first glance , the matrix , larry & andy wachowski's sci-fi/kung-fu/shoot-em-up spectacular , looks like a prime candidate to join the list of high-concept bad movies , especially with dopey keanu reeves in the leading role . 

but despite high levels of cheese and gaudy dialogue , the matrix works . 

it's an uncanny blend of action and surreal fantasy that borrows from dozens of other films ( most obviously the terminator films , star wars , and total recall ) , but remains refreshingly original and interesting throughout . 

reeves plays neo , a computer hacker who stumbles into an initially bewildering set of encounters with "" trinity "" ( carrie-anne moss ) , a rival hacker who has supernatural powers and stunning good looks , a unseen , omniscient cult figure known as "" morpheus "" ( lawrence fishburne ) , and a trio of creepy men in dark suits who act like irs agents from hell . 

neo quickly learns that the world he has known all his life is not what it seems . 

moreover , he discovers that the grim , bleak world he is introduced to has been waiting for him to save it . 

neo is reluctant to assume the role of messiah , with grave doubts that he is actually "" the one "" prophesized to come and save the world . 

reluctant or not , what follows is a mix of hong kong-style slow-motion shootouts , surreal dream sequences , high speed chases , and comic book kung-fu fights . 

the film also raises interesting philosophical questions about reality . 

how exactly do you know what is real and what is in your mind ? 

and if the real world were much harsher and grim than a fantasy one you were living in , would you want to face the true world or continue to live in a more comfortable illusion ? 

unfortunately , the matrix doesn't provide many answers to the questions it raises , but at least it puts some ideas behind all the explosions , shoot-outs , and flying roundhouse kicks . 

perhaps stealing the entire show in the matrix is australian actor hugo weaving , who plays agent smith , the leader of the creepy agents in sunglasses and suits who seem capable of being anywhere and doing anything to stop neo and friends from destabilizing the matrix . 

weaving's stony appearance , deadpan voice , and chilling comments put a grim human face on the haunting , evil technological force that controls the matrix . 

like robert patrick as the shapeshifting t-1000 terminator in terminator 2 : judgement day , weaving is more frightening than any monstrous alien or homicidal robot because , despite his power and seeming invincibility , he looks ordinary , even scrawny . 

weaving embodies his role with a memorably chilling presence . 

the film features some truly breathtaking special effects and stylish cinematography . 

it seems to be deliberately kitchy , with stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping that reportedly required months of martial arts training by the actors . 

in a few scenes , the posing and posturing is unintentionally funny . 

just seeing keanu reeves engaging in serious kung fu is a bit jarring . 

however , with the comic-book style and tone of the film , you can sustain willing disbelief long enough to enjoy the ride without losing patience . 

the matrix isn't a classic . 

its open-ended and confusing conclusion raises more questions than it answers . 

it fails to resolve many of its own plot twists and philosophical questions . 

it also relies on some conventional sentimentality to save the hero - the kind of shmaltzy feel-good goo that most of the film avoids . 

reportedly , the producers have high hopes for the film being the first in a trilogy and have already begun work on the story for the sequel . 

unfortunately , audiences deserve a little more than a vague sense that the story will continue in the future . 

the matrix is an fun , enjoyable diversion , like a big puff of cotton candy at a carnival . 

just don't be surprised half an hour later when you still feel a little hungry . 
"
"at the outset of swordfish , john travolta's gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today . 

basically , he says , it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers . 

how ironic , as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture . 

swordfish is loud , violent and amoral . 

it has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life . 

and how does travolta's gabriel plan to do this ? 

by robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out-terrorize terrorists . 

swordfish is a very cynical movie . 

it relies on an audience's perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non-human , faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration . 

the movie's plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down , you'd actually see how ridiculous it all is . 

this is a live-action road runner cartoon , moving so quickly that it's over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions . 

the storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson ( hugh jackman ) , recruited by gabriel to crack the government's computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his anti-terrorist campaign . 

talk about whacked-out patriotism . 

my objections to swordfish are many . 

the body count is high , but that is expected in a movie of this sort . 

it's becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers , police officers and government agents blown to bits . 

another example is the family dynamics between stanley , his 10-year-old daughter and his ex-wife . 

stanley , though having served time in prison for hacking , is shown as a loving and caring father , forbidden by his ex to see his little girl . 

audience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband's adult films . 

thus when she is found murdered late in the movie , neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve . 

in fact , subconsciously , many in the audience are probably glad she was killed . 

then there is the sequence involving one of gabriel's henchman holding a gun to the head of stanley's daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel . 

children as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich ? in recent films . 

there is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them on-screen victims as well . 

yea , it's only make believe , but that doesn't mean you have to tolerate it . 

travolta is cool , deadly charming and flamboyant as the near-crazy gabriel . 

his character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and face/off . 

jackman looks dour through most of the proceedings . 

his only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database . 

his sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate . 

halle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriel's assistant , while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel . 

swordfish plays like a comic book with a larger-than-life character in gabriel . 

viewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain . 

and maybe that is the movie's underlying flaw : there is no real hero to speak of , only those doing their upmost to survive . 

and that is not enough . 

this is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water .

" * * * the following review contains some harsh language . . . 

but what did you expect when you clicked on this title ? 

 * * * 

cast : kristen holly smith , danica sheridan , alex boling , michael dotson , sonya hensley , janet krajeski , sabrina lu , dionysius burbano , calvin grant , jeff b . harmon written and directed by : jeff b . harmon running time : 97 minutes 

 "" the thought of losing you makes me all vomity inside . "" 

--- blatz balinski ( danica sheridan ) laments the fact that her lesbian lover , april ( kristen holly smith ) , has just received a telegram from her ex-fiance . 

isle of lesbos is an incredibly offensive musical comedy about april pfferpot ( smith ) , a resident of the small town of bumfuck , arkansas who is about to get married to high school sweetheart and football hero dick dickson ( michael dotson ) . 

when april gets extreme cold feet she runs home , sticks a gun in her mouth , and pulls the trigger . 

instead of killing herself , she is magically transported through her mirror into the isle of lesbos , an alternate dimension where lesbians rule and no men are allowed ( except for lance , the homosexual toilet cleaner/slave ) . 

april loves her new home and friends , but dick and her parents are not so ready to give her up . 

mr . and ms . pfferpot ( director jeff b . harmon and janet krajeski ) decide they need medical help so they enlist the aid of dr . sigmoid colon ( also jeff b . harmon ) , who claims he can cure homosexuality . 

in actuality , dr . colon is homosexual as well and begins his special "" treatment "" on dick dickson ( unbeknownst to dick ) . 

when april turns down dick's demand for her to return to bumfuck , he decides to take matters in his own hands and attack the isle of lesbos rambo-style . 

instead of leveling the place he falls in love with lance ( alex boling ) and the two of them , along with april and her lover blatz , get married . 

 ( note to the filmmaker : why did the character of lance make asides to the camera followed by silence that i'm assuming was inserted for the purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience had subsided ? ) 

april's parents , feeling like there is no recourse , call in a favor to president clinton and send a nuclear bomb ( whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer ) their way . 

the bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the "" circuitry "" and they re-wire it and send it back to washington d . c . , destroying it . 

mr . and ms . pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own . 

i'm not sure if writer/director/co-star jeff b . harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs . 

either way , he manages to present some of the most offensive material i have ever seen in a movie . 

the film opens with a preacher running a small african-american child out of town , and then later moves on to the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan ( during a jaunty musical number ) , preceded by remarks about "" gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others , such as the jews "" . 

if harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be , then i apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film , but it is presented so mean spiritedly that i can't help but feel like he had some serious intent . 

as for the entire central theme of the movie , i'm afraid that it's one that i just don't get . 

i tried to keep an open mind while watching it , but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes . 

it was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society . 

how does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of non-acceptance ? 

i'm not prone to judging anyone and i believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society , but don't force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren't going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me . 

again , maybe i'm missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make , but if so , i think it could have been handled a little more tactfully . 

as far as musical comedies go , isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical , but a good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy . 

despite the disturbing visuals , "" mom and apple pie "" stuck with me for the rest of the day . 

speaking of disturbing visuals , "" wedding bells ain't ringing "" could have been a decent song , but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying . 

 "" i'm a lesbian "" ( which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular ) is also pretty good , but a good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms . smith . 

it's mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based . 

the other performers are decent , save for the rosie o'donnell like performance given by danica sheridan . 

i have no inherent problem with her character ; it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired . 

one particular musical number , "" lesbian rock "" , was one of the lowest points i have ever experienced in my film-going life thanks to a strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan . 

the film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll . 

the remainder of the running time is padded out with a few more songs ( "" lesbian rock "" included ) and the ridiculously presented anti-nukes message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it a feature length film . 

once the "" isle of lesbos reprise "" was reached , i felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all . 

why was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end ? 

isle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www . indie-underground . com . 

the transfer is pretty clean ( and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent ) and the film is letterboxed at approximately 1 . 85 : 1 . 

in many respects , isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential ( like a rocky horror for the new millennium ) . 

this film is by no means my cup of tea , but i know there are those out there who will enjoy it . 

if you think it might be for you , then by all means seek it out . 

i , on the other hand , will be cleansing my palette with a good action film like gladiator . . . 

wait . aren't gladiator films considered to be . . . 

oh , never mind .

"what is a scary movie anyhow ? 

is it a movie where a person gets ripped to shreds ? 

is it where a person is being chased by some damned teenager who wants revenge ? 

possibly its some guy with a hook who wants to know what you did last summer . 

what ever happened to horror movies , where the horror was in the atmosphere , and in the characters . 

movies like "" halloween "" and "" psycho "" which revolutionized horror genre forever , but wait in 1973 came a movie based on the bestselling book by william peter blatty , entitled "" the exorcist "" , the movie opened to rave reviews , and scared audiences to death , now in the year 2000 "" the exorcist "" comes back to the big screen in a version you've never seen complete with six channel digital surround sound , and fifteen minutes of new footage never before seen as long as a new ending . 

chris mcniell is an actress living in georgetown washington with her twelve year old daughter regan . 

while working on a new film , chris still stays close to regan , but starts to wonder why her bed shakes at night , and why regan starts to have convulsions all of a sudden . 

when chris finds out that regan is possessed by a demon , she shuns at the fact of it , but considers getting a priest to help her daughter . 

father karras ( jason miller ) is the man they bring in , his mother has just died , and still in mourning he decides to help this little girl . 

christ , father karras , and their nanny sharon ( kitty winn ) have to sit and wait until a man shows up , that man is the exorcist , and that man will help this little girl . 

excrutiatingly scary , the exorcist is a classic horror film , which twenty seven years later still scares audiences half to death . 

now we get to the experience "" the exorcist "" the way it was meant to be seen in a director's cut which incorpates fifteen minutes of new footage cut by friedkin at the time of the release for content and time , a new ending has been added as well , and adds more of a lighter feeling to the movie , which i prefer the original darker ending more . 

the movie has also been remastered in a wonderful six channel digital sound mix , and is amazing . 

the voices are all clear , the music pours out on you and engulfs you in richness . 

as a director friedkin has been well known for other films , but his standout film is "" the exorcist "" nominated for several academy awards it one a few , but was somehow doubted best picture , best actress ( ellen burstyn ) and best supporting actress ( linda blair ) who at the age of i believe thirteen does a wonderful job of being a little girl , alone , possessed and unable to stop what is going on . 

ellen burstyn i think gives her best performance to date , and can be seen currently in "" requiem for a dream "" to which she is getting rave reviews for . 

jason miller ( jason patrik's dad ) is amazing as father karras , and his performance will be forever embedded in my mind , to me he is the character who makes the entire film float along . 

i was saddened when i saw this film with an audience of mostly younger people to see them laughing at this movie , i in no way , think that this movie is comical , yes some of the stuff regan says is funny , but they were laughing at her head spinning , and the green pea soup , come on people this is some creepy stuff ! 

anyway the re-release of the film has managed to make $40 million dollars , and is still going . 

hopefully one day they re-release it again in twenty years for more generations to come to enjoy .

"martin scorsese's triumphant adaptation of edith wharton's the age of innocence is a stunning film for the quintessential new york filmmaker , the man who brought the streets of taxi driver and mean streets to life . 

it seems like an odd choice for scorsese to do a period piece in the early 1900's , but the fact that he pulls it off so brilliantly is a wonder , and a testament to the greatness of scorsese as a filmmaker . 

this is a gorgeous visual experience that it surely one of scorsese's finest . 

newland archer ( day-lewis ) is a prestigious lawyer who is engaged to may welland ( ryder ) , a somewhat empty and shallow new yorker , who belongs to a prestigious family and is quite beautiful . 

the marriage is one which will unite two very prestigious families , in a society where nothing is more important than the opinions of others . 

on the day that archer is to announce his engagement to may , countess ellen olenska ( pfeiffer ) , cousin of may , walks into archer's life . 

archer is immediately captivated , and finds himself in love with ellen . 

archer is also bound by the limits of new york society , which is an intrusive as any other in the world . 

archer finds himself having a secret love affair in his mind with countess olenska , attempting to keep her in his mind while trying not to lose his social status . 

the film's subject matter may seem alien to scorsese , but the theme is definitely not . 

it is a theme of forbidden romance , guilty pleasures , and the consequences causes because of those actions . 

there is a painstakingly flawed hero , and his choice between the life he wants , and the life he is destined for . 

in truth , it is a film about a society the audience doesn't know about , but wants to find out more , much like the society of goodfellas or even kundun . 

the performances are absolutely breathtaking . 

day-lewis portrays more mental anguish in his face than one man should be forced to take . 

pfeiffer is marvelous as countess olenska , a mix of passion and beauty that the audience would die for as well . 

ryder is probably the gem of the group , for it is her quiet presence that overwhelms the plot , and slowly pushes day-lewis closer and closer to his eventual ending . 

the supporting cast is also wonderful , with several characters so singular that they are indelible in one's memory . 

scorsese definitely has a passion for filmmaking . 

his lavish and sumptuous set design and marvelous recreation of new york is a wondrous sight . 

he literally transports the viewer to another world with incredible imagery . 

his script is also excellent , slow in buildup , with a rapid conclusion and a fantastic ending that has to be seen to be believed . 

it is difficult to make a period piece gripping : scorsese , however , does it beautifully . 

the famous cameras of the legendary director are also everywhere . 

he is patient , but he films everything and anything remotely important . 

the cameras sweep , pan , track , and do more than they've ever done , but they are so subtle , one doesn't realize he's watching all the scorsese hallmarks until a 2nd viewing . 

the central tracking shot is probably longer and more complex than the famous goodfellas shot , but the viewer doesn't notice it , because we want to see more of this gorgeous world . 

there are a few deft touches of filmmaking that are simply outstanding , and joanne woodward' narration is exquisite . 

not a fast film like goodfellas , this shares more in common with kundun than anything else . 

and like kundun , this is a slow-starting film that truly shines , when given the chance to fully breathe and bloom in the end . 

a beautiful film by a director continuing to challenge himself year after year .

"mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival . 

as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival . 

it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time . 

in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry . 

toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart . 

the film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it . 

something else is what he did . 

the film opens with a woman ( played by laura harring ) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life . 

she crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep . 

meanwhile young vivacious betty ( naomi watts ) arrives in hollywood from canada . 

she wants to build a career as an actress . 

betty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow . 

she does not know who the woman is . 

she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is . 

they fix on a name rita for her , but are not sure if this right or not . 

meanwhile local director adam kesher ( justin theroux ) has problems of his own . 

he is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else , cammie rhodes ( melissa george ) . 

these two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong . 

there is also a strange character called the cowboy ( monty montgomery ) adding to the confusion . 

in what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits . 

a lot of mulholland drive starts out fun . 

lynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film . 

he just chooses not to . 

as with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason . 

there are no earthworms , but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches . 

the film is a little long for the subject matter . 

toward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes , clearly not intended for the tv pilot . 

unfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers . 

i will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . 

mulholland drive spoiler warning . 

i have rated this film fairly low . 

you should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film . 

david lynch is in large part a dark satirist . 

most of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside . 

in mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre . 

what he does with this film is ( are you sure you want to read this ? ) 

playing off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on . 

the first 80% of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout . 

then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something . 

the audience expectation is that they will add up . 

but he has given clues that are self-contradictory . 

lynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories . 

in fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke . 

there is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties . 

mad magazine called it a poiuyt . 

other sources called it a tri- pronged u-bar . 

look at small portions of it and makes sense . 

look at the whole figure and it does not . 

this film is , in my estimation , the cinematic equivalent of a tri-pronged u-bar . 
"
"its a stupid little movie that trys to be clever and sophisticated , yet trys a bit too hard . 

with the voices of woody allen , gene hackman , jennifer lopez , sylvester stallone , and sharon stone , this computer-animated yak-fest ( think toy story [1996] filled with used merchandising ) is one for the ant-eaters . 

the main story is the independence of a worker named z ( allen ) . 

he wants more to life than just digging away underground for the colony . 

when he finds out about ``insectopia , "" a mythical place where all insects can run free , z , along with his colony's princess ( stone ) , journey out into the world to find a meaning for life . 

about 15 minutes into the picture , i began to wonder what the point of the film was . 

halfway through , i still didn't have an answer . 

by the end credits , i just gave up and ran out . 

antz is a mindless mess of poor writing and even poorer voice-overs . 

allen is nonchalant , while i would have guessed , if i hadn't seen her in the mighty and basic instinct , stone can't act , even in a cartoon . 

this film is one for the bugs : unfunny and extremely dull . 

hey , a bug's life may have a good time doing antz in . 
"
"all right , all right , we get the point : despite all similarities to the best-selling story , speechless is * not * based on the romance between 1992 presidential campaign rivals james carville and mary matalin . 

in fact , the script was in development well before 1992 . 

still , the comparisons are inevitable , until one realizes a critical difference . 

no , it's not that the speechless twosome are speech writers , not campaign managers ; it's that carville and matalin's story is actually interesting . 

speechless is a limp , poorly structured would-be romantic comedy . 

speechless is set during a new mexico senatorial campaign , where kevin vallick ( michael keaton ) and julia mann ( geena davis ) meet and get romantic one night when neither one can sleep . 

what neither one realizes is that they are on opposite sides of the campaign : kevin is a sit-com writer brought in to punch up the republican candidate's speeches , while julia is the chief speech writer for the democratic candidate . 

at first each one believes that the other has an ulterior motive for the relationship , but eventually they let down their guard and become closer . 

but there are plent of obstacles in the way , including julia's stud-reporter fiance ( christopher reeve ) and a series of stunts which continue to prove that all's fair in love and politics . 

the standard formula for a movie like speechless would have the two principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the end that they're crazy about each other . 

screenwriter robert king completely subverts expectations by throwing kevin and julia into each other's arms in the first fifteen minutes , then developing the antagonism . 

it's a noble attempt to shake things up , but unfortunately it just doesn't work . 

part of the fun of watching sparring in a romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the characters do , but in speechless they already know they're attracted to each other , and we're left with waiting for the campaign to end so they'll admit that they love each other already . 

there is such a herky-jerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even king's sharp dialogue can't prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour . 

inconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis and michael keaton , and with those performances most of their scenes together . 

the problems begin with their initial courtship , which does virtually nothing to establish julia's character and merely establishes that kevin is a wise-ass . 

davis is radiantly beautiful , and keaton is generally entertaining , but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter one bit . 

in a couple of scenes , like a quiet moment sitting at a fountain , they actually achieve some measure of connection . 

for the most part , however , they're just actors spouting lines . 

you keep waiting for a little spark , and it never happens . 

perhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechless's politics . 

the setting seems perfect for a high- energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix , but that's never the tone that underwood is going for . 

he wants a warm , fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaiman's flute-and-wind musical score , and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background . 

it might as well have been a story about rival grocers , and every single character is about as uninspired as he or she could possibly be . 

i was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert king's previous screenplay , the dana carvey flop clean slate , so i had some hopes for speechless . 

but while there is wit in the words , this is a script which was probably much better on paper . 

on screen , it's still paper thin .

"godzilla is a nuclear freak . 

he is a lizard that has been mutated over the years and has become a new species , one that has a foot as long as this bus , and a claw as long as this sign . 

this aquatic creature made its first attack in the pacific islands . 

he tore up a ship that carried dozens of japanese men . 

one survived . 

only he was left to recount the terror that he had seen . 

he was merely able to repeat the words "" godzilla . . . godzilla . . . godzilla "" . 

the film then introduces us to matthew broderick , a biologist who has been studying the fascinating growth of chernobyl earthworms . 

 "" they're 17% larger than they used to be ! "" he proclaims . 

the u . s . military pulls him off this three year project and assigns him to figure out what godzilla is . 

and , boy , does he find out . 

and , boy , does godzilla suck . 

i hate to use such a word in a review , something that is supposed to inform my audience , but i really need to drive this one home and i refuse to use explitives . 

it is unbelieveable to me how the producers of this movie saw the final cut and said , "" ok ! 

it's great ! 

let's show this puppy . "" 

roland emmerich needs a good horse whipping . 

his latest piece of trash makes id4 look like a masterpiece of modern american cinema . 

and if steven spielberg had never made the jurassic park films , emmerich and his team of talent-challenged imbeciles would never have had a clue as to how the creature should look . 

let me give you a few examples of this terrible attempt at filmmaking . 

i plan on giving some things away here . 

belive me , godzilla holds no surprises for anyone with an iq higher than their shoe size , so . . . no 

worries . 

however , if you are looking for that "" first time thrill "" and you refuse to let me do you this favor , by all means , stop reading now . 

a . ) godzilla makes his first ever attack in the pacific islands . 

he next strikes in new york city . 

um . . . anyone have a map handy ? 

b . ) the mayor of new york city is a heavy set individual with parted gray hair and thick glasses . 

his name is mayor ebert . 

his assistant is named gene . 

gene gives ebert a thumbs down at the end of the film . 

i couldn't make this up if i tried , folks . 

c . ) stay with me on this one . . . 

ok . 

godzilla can out run torpedoes . 

hank azaria can out run godzilla babies . 

 ( which look more like jurassic park raptors than the jurassic park raptors . ) 

d . ) the u . s . military , upon realization that godzilla has disappeared after running rampant through the city , decides that he "" might be hiding in a building . "" 

e . ) ( oh yeah , i can go all the way to e . ) godzilla strikes at manhattan . 

manhattan , an island approximately the size of san francisco holds three million people . 

they evactuate to new jersey in about one day . 

no problem . 

f . ) early on , they bait godzilla with fish . 

 ( he likes fish , you know . ) 

the thing is on an island . 

the atlantic ocean is three steps east , but pile a whole bunch of grouper on fifth and 57th . . . oh 

he's gonna come running . 

g . ) you know what ? 

i'll stop with the list now . . . the 

alphabet isn't big enough anyway . 

the dialogue makes me wonder if producer dean devlin had his five year old do a re-write . 

 "" the kid is good ! "" he must have said . 

maria pitillo is looking to become a name in hollywood by starring in this potential blockbuster . 

bad move , maria . 

acting doesn't get much worse than her turn as broderick's ex-flame . 

matthew broderick is a good actor , but you'd never give him a chance if godzilla were the only film of his you'd seen . 

jean reno needs to pick his american films a bit more carefully . 

at times , godzilla seems to be headed toward a zucker , abrahams , zucker film . 

 ( airplane ! , naked gun . ) 

the jokes are indeed that bad . 

but just when you think the filmmakers are having fun with you , they take themselves seriously . 

how dare they ! 

godzilla would have been better if it had only thrown in visual sight gags and fart jokes . 

at least then we would know we were supposed to laugh . 

each and every character in godzilla is beyond stupid and i was really pulling for the beast to kill more of them . 

emmerich did do one thing , though . 

 ( and i've no idea if it was intentional . ) 

he made me sympathize with godzilla . 

his attackers were so damn dumb that i felt sorry for him being pelted with bullets and missles . 

but what made me feel even sorrier for him was that his famous name will always be attatched to one of the worst films hollywood has ever produced .

" "" my name is jack carter , and you don't want to know me "" says our brooding anti-hero ( sylvester stallone ) . 

take his advice ! 

to know this guy is as rewarding as being thrown over a terrace . 

and to watch this film is almost as painful . 

 "" get carter "" is a gloomy looking , unimaginative film that offers no joy . 

jack carter is as tough as tough guys come . 

he works out of vegas as a self-described 'financial adjuster' . 

explaining his duties , he says , "" people make promises and break them . 

i help them remember . "" 

he has a chiseled body full of tattoos . 

he has the weathered look indicative of a man who has seen his share of hard times . 

he speaks in a hushed but menacing tone of voice . 

in other words , this is sylvester stallone acting like . . . sylvester 

stallone . 

and like most of his previous roles , his character is a shallow , one-dimensional thug whose modus operandi is to talk tough , hassle a few hapless people , find out what he needs to know , and then dispense his own kind of justice . 

with the charisma of a pit bull , being tough is all that jack carter knows . 

yet , even tough guys know when to put family first . 

as the story begins , we learn that jack's little brother has died in a car accident . 

the police attribute it to heavy drinking . 

however , jack is suspicious , believing that he was 'taken out' . 

he takes a break from his vegas duties and tries to see if he can find the truth . 

as he pokes around , he runs into several lowlife characters . 

they include a shady business partner , a prostitute , a dweebish millionaire molded after bill gates , and an oily owner of a porn website . 

any one of them may know something about his brother's death . 

all of them have the means of carrying out the deed . 

but don't expect an exercise in sleuthing where well-placed clues lead carter to the truth . 

he's all brawn and no brains , so there are no epiphanies during his investigation . 

instead , he uses intimidation to muscle his way forward , cycling through this circle of suspects . 

flustered with his lack of progress , he cycles through them again and again . 

this all gets tiring fairly quickly . 

by the time the film launches into its final act , we're numb from its pedestrian pace . 

oddly , as a tough-guy thriller , it starves us for action . 

admittedly , there is one nifty chase sequence , but this is related to a tangential and needless plot ( carter's vegas ties send thugs to retrieve him ) . 

the story also fails to generate any kind of emotion . 

stallone has the personality of a slab of stone . 

and the look and feel of the film is perpetually downcast . 

the weather is constantly overcast or rainy . 

meanwhile , most shots take place at night , in dimly lit rooms , or in dark alleys . 

it's just impossible to get stirred about that kind of atmosphere . 

as a result , "" get carter "" amounts to nothing more than a flat thriller , bereft of clever moments and devoid of any excitement . 

you're better off leaving this guy alone .

"when i ponder childhood memories past , one of the things that always springs immediately to mind is watching the "" inspector gadget "" tv show with my older brother . 

truth be told , we were rabid fanatics ; our version of cowboys and indians was chasing each other around our coffee table to the theme tune , alternating who would get to be gadget and who would be stuck playing the part of dr . claw , the inspector's arch nemesis . 

i was never a biggie on nostalgia , but you just can't help but have fond memories of something like that . 

sometimes i even find myself up at 4am watching re-runs of my favorite episodes , trying to recapture some of that sense of wonder i felt as a kid . 

at the very least , i was expecting the new film version of the classic television series to have at least some kind of similar effect on me . 

despite how horrid a film may be , the simple task of rekindling even a slight feeling of nostalgia is pretty tough to screw up . 

so back i sat , with minimum expectations of what the movie would deliver ( let's face it ; exactly how good can a live-action disney film really be ? ) . 

i was wise enough to steer clear from the likes of mr . magoo and george of the jungle ( two previous disney adaptations ) , and i wish to god that i had been sharp enough to skip gadget as well . 

rarely has a movie left me with such an utter feeling of emptiness . 

as everyone else was getting up to exit the screening room after the movie had completed its assault on mankind , i was left sitting there , absolutely speechless and totally dumbfounded at what i had just seen . 

can something this awful truly exist in such an evolved world ? 

right from the beginning , i knew i was in trouble . 

in the opening scenes , each character is introduced as if their sole purpose is to just be , to simply serve as real-life duplicates of their cartoon clones . 

when referring to them , people almost yell in fear that the audience will not catch on as to who a certain character is supposed to be ( "" oh , hi penny ! 

is brain with you ? "" ) . 

creating one-dimensional replicas is one thing ; having mere names take the place of them is quite another . 

the "" plot "" , shall we call it , stays fairly in tune with the original series . 

matthew broderick stars as john brown ( how creative is that ? ) , 

a security guard who is horribly injured by a pack of ruthless businessmen headed by scolex ( why , rupert everett , for the love of god why ? ? ? ! ! ! ) , who himself is transformed into claw by an unfortunate chain of events . 

brown is then rescued and used as a prototype for a new law-enforcement technology wherein he's joined with various machine parts and some nifty gadgets to form ( drumroll , please ) . . . 

inspector gadget ! 

>from here on out , the movie becomes a hodgepodge of stupid dialog and confusing situations ( although , to be fair , my confusion could have been caused by the virtual concussion the film was inflicting upon my fragile mind ) . 

there's something about an evil gadget taking over the city ( his first crime must have been swiping matt dillon's dentures from there's something about mary ) and it all ends with ( what else ? ) a bunch of post-credit nonsense and a cameo by don adams himself . 

to be honest , i wasn't much paying attention to these "" treats "" . 

i was just glad that it was over .

"capsule : annoyingly unentertaining , obvious and paper-thin buddy/cop/drug/sexy-witness movie . 

presence of director michael bay shows none of the talent he demonstrated in the rock . 

i've seen this movie already , i said , as i looked at the box art . 

no , i haven't even seen a trailer for the movie ; i don't even know what it's about , but i can look at the way they're promoting it , and i know i've seen it already . 

i thought : it's about these two cops . 

and they're buddies , sort of . 

they're at each other's throats a lot , but they really do like each other . 

and everyone else in their department hates them 'cause they're hot-shots . 

and they have some kind of diametric opposition in their relationship . 

and one day they're in the middle of cop business as usual when they get mixed up in this plot that involves a really sadistic bad guy with lots of henchmen who can never hit anything with the billions of rounds of ammo they are always carrying . 

and the bad guy is a drug lord . 

and there's a witness , and she's this sexy thing who rubs both of them the wrong way . 

and their supervisor wants their badges for breakfast when they blow up half the town bringing this guy down . 

i only missed the bit about the badges . 

the rest i got dead-on . 

and i hadn't even left the video store yet . 

the cops in this movie are will smith and martin lawrence , and the bad guy is the immensely underutilized tcheky karyo . 

smith plays a cop who has a trust fund and is thus not a cop for the money ; martin l . is a family man ( shades of the now-tired lethal weapon dynamic here ) whose wife and he are at total odds . 

this leads to some strained scenes about lawrence's "" not getting any "" , and some totally unneccesary bits with him skulking around his own house , thinking his partner is now his wife's "" back door man "" . 

not funny ; tiresome . 

bad boys gets some of its incredibly meager selling points from the presence of will smith and martin lawrence . 

will smith is a natural , and i'm happy to see him in movies like six degrees . . . 

and men in black . 

he's funny and charming without trying to be ; he really does seem to be enjoying himself . 

martin lawrence is a different story ; he's so uptight and verbally constipated that sitting through his improvised riffs are a trial . 

movies like this are not about originality . 

i know this . 

they are about style and energy and synergy between actors . 

i know this , too . 

and yet , while watching bad boys , which its glamorous photography and impossibly exact stunt choreography , i felt fed up . 

i'd seen con air , which despite being completely implausible , was still great fun , because it tried however feebly to put some new life into the mix . 

bad boys is a dry run -- and overlong , too , clocking in at just over two hours with a lot more by-play than i felt could be justified . 

i could write this movie . 

you could write this movie . 

many people have . 

many people will continue to write this movie , over and over again . 

other people will buy it from them , and make it , and we will pay money to see it . 

more the fools we all . 

in a terrifyingly prescient line from his book a scanner darkly , phil k . dick once mused that the mcdonaldburger ( as he called it ) would eventually eclipse money as the token of cultural and financial exchange . 

one day we will all just sit in our living rooms and sell the same burger back and forth to each other . 

the same could be said about this movie . 

i have the sinking feeling we're going to see it again . 

soon .

"warren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest , craziest and hard hitting movie in his career . 

based on a story concocted by himself , and also written by beatty , bulworth gives a good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system . 

beatty stars as senator jay bulworth , who's going through a nervous breakdown . 

after hiring someone to kill him , he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about what's _really_ happening in american politics , much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy ( platt . ) 

instead of everyone hating him , the american public love him . 

however , inside his party , more people want to kill him than just the hired assassin . 

and he also strikes a relationship with black girl nina ( berry . ) 

it's remarkable that this film was released at all . 

much more open than the rather subdued primary colours , bulworth barely gives the american politic system a good name . 

the outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny , and also somewhat true . 

it's great that beatty isn't afraid to let loose on a subject . 

talking of beatty , he's excellent in the role of the demented senator , clearing having fun . 

and seeing warren beatty have fun is a rare sight indeed . 

even in dick tracy , he was the most straighten face actor . 

 ( then again , he was the only characters face we could completely see . ) 

the film gives an opportunity for the 61 year old beatty to indulge in some rapping , which he does with gusto ( and also quite well . ) 

and seeing beatty as a 'homeboy' has to be seen to be believed . 

it's nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself . 

second best is oliver platt as the flustered , coke snorting assistant , who goes over the top when he finally snaps . 

halle berry is fine , and sexy , as the intellectual nina , who comes to like the senator . 

also popping up in the supporting cast is paul sorvino wit h a strange accent , laurie metcalf as the exact same characters she's also played , and christine baranski of cybill fame as bullworths wife , who all contribute to the fun . 

and , this being a political film , the ubiquitous larry king makes an appearance , as , * shock * , himself . 

the writing and directing , both by beatty , are above par . 

the direction is very nearly sitcom like , but suits the film perfectly , and both the politics are gangland parts are handled well . 

the script is funny , and the raps are actually well produced and humorous , and quite clever . 

they're not cringe inducing , at least . 

the script makes many points about society in america today , and isn't afraid to make any bold statements about what is a flawed system . 

best of all , the film is thought provoking , but directed and written in such a way that the film feels as light as a feather , and is very entertaining . 

there's also a great rap soundtrack with some well chosen tunes . 

bulworth is a film with many advantages , and few flaws . 

perhaps it could be somewhat embarrassing to see a 61 year old man rapping , but beatty does it so well it's irrelevant . 

in fact , there's very little against bulworth , except for the language which is very heavy , but then again it should be expected . 

bulworth , then , is well worth watching . 

a david wilcock review ? 1999 

 "" you know , for kids "" - norville barnes 
"
"in the interest of being generous , i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black . 

sir anthony hopkins , playing a super-rich media mogul , has gathered his family around him for dinner . 

his oldest daughter ( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing ) , who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake . 

the daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes . 

hopkins , frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in his position would do : he punts . 

whichever one you like , dear , he says . 

and the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do : she cries . 

i liked that scene for two reasons . 

first , the cakes looked really cool . 

second , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act . 

meet joe black is chock-full of odd performances , people doing things for no discernible reason at all , and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot . 

it's easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani , but it's even easier to sleep right through it ( two people on my row managed it quite nicely ) . 

the difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess . 

i know my audience had problems with the movie , because they thought it was a comedy . 

case in point : everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie . 

however , the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani . 

 ( it's not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death , but it makes a certain kind of sense . ) 

it shouldn't take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr . pitt . 

and indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt ) , because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished . 

well , when that happened , the audience howled with laughter , and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous . 

so , if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing-room humor are funny , i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately . 

anyway , the deceased lawyer's body , no worse the wear from its massive injuries , is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role . 

the idea is that death ( given the pen name of joe black , so as not to disturb others ) wants to take a holiday and experience the world . 

if this weren't hollywood , we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death , but since it is , we get scene after scene of fish-out-of-water humor , just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who's wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn't know how to act in our society . 

it also doesn't help that the character of death is written so inconsistently . 

he claims to be on vacation , but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani ( just try to get your travel agent to book that one ) . 

he speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois . 

he knows everything about some characters , nothing about others . 

and as played by brad pitt , he's not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing , he's just there . 

it's as if someone told pitt , "" never mind about acting in this picture , son , just stand there and look pretty . "" 

it's as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie . 

i've used the phrase "" angel of death "" in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt's performance with this year's best angel performance , nicolas cage's in city of angels . 

where pitt is cold and unfeeling , cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows . 

where cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man , pitt is aloof and arrogant . 

cage struck instant chemical sparks with co-star meg ryan , where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani's character is so shallow that she can't see beyond pitt's good looks . 

the movie's other top name is a much better actor , but that doesn't save meet joe black . 

sir anthony hopkins isn't given much better material to work with , unfortunately . 

he plays one of these good-hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood . 

 ( one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins's character more realistically evil . ) 

hopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker , but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world . 

of course , no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder . 

but i have to wonder ( and in this movie , you have a very long time to wonder ) how you or i would act in a similar situation , especially if you or i were a multimillionaire . 

hopkins pretty much goes to the office -- and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation . 

fans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated , i'm sure . 

i stayed awake all the way through meet joe black , and i'm asking myself why . 

movies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest , which is what i'm going to do now . 

go spend time with your family , go volunteer for a local charity , heck , go take a nap . 

don't go see meet joe black , because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death .

"
"ever watch a very young child try and tell a joke that is beyond his , or her , sophistication ? 

it's full of stops and starts and usually , the punch line is ruined . 

i felt the same way watching drowning mona . 

skip a stone across water and you approximate the depth of this attempt at an ensemble comedy . 

there are some slightly successful attempts at humor , but they only serve as window dressing . 

there is a running gag about the town , verplanck , n . y . , being a test town for the then new yugo . 

everyone drives a yugo , differentiating their cars with personalized license plates . 

even the police chief drives one . 

there is a certain sublimeness to the image of a lights and siren decked out yugo skittering its way through the town streets . 

there also is a running gag about one of the characters , jeff , missing a hand and how it occurred . 

it pokes gentle fun at the notion of urban legends . 

it turns out the truth is more horrifying than any legend . 

there are some sight gags that pop up as well , such as mona's tombstone , which reads "" demoted "" , instead of devoted . 

still , the core of the story maintains the flatness of a still pond . 

the lynchpin of the film falls on the redundant and sporadic scenes involving mona ( midler ) . 

each scene with her is the same : scream at someone , hit someone , then scream some more . 

there's no uniqueness or modulation to her or explanation for her meanness . 

anyone off the street could have played the role , such as it is . 

the other characters are walking cardboard cutouts . 

each one is defined by one trait and no further attempt is made at deeper characterization . 

there is a burly , female car mechanic , so of course , there is a forced lesbianism gag . 

mona's son , jeff ( marcus thomas ) is a simpleton , hence you can predict his dialogue before it even plods its way from his mouth . 

chief of police rash ( devito ) likes broadway musicals and loves his daughter . 

there's nothing more to him . 

elle , the chief's daughter ( campbell ) , is bland personified , a dutiful girl with no higher aspiration than to have a child and be married . 

mona's husband phil ( fichtner ) jeckle and hydes from shirking coward to reptilian letch . 

bob ( affleck ) , elle's betrothed , and business partner to jeff , is a mumbling , obvious dullard . 

there is no contrast to any of the characters . 

by having at least one character with some wit , or wits , to serve as counterpoint to the others , perhaps steinfeld's attempt at satirizing a small town infested with ambitionless people might have come off better . 

ostensibly a murder mystery , drowning mona gives you almost all the clues immediately , then lets you sit back and feel superior as you watch the cast of paper people fumble their way to finding the killer , who could be anyone due to mona's loving manner with everyone on town . 

even that aspect of the film fails , throwing in a convenient , ridiculous and unsatisfying wrap to things . 

it's been a while since i walked away from a movie theater in an angry mood . 

what makes it all the more remarkable is that i rarely remember a comedy making me so angry for wasting my time at it's ineptitude . 
"
"if this keeps up , jane austen ( sense and sensibility , pride and prejudice ) may have to apply for posthumous membership to the screen writers guild . 

yet another novel of hers has made the transition to the silver screen . 

mansfield park is a turn of the century ( 18th century going on 19th ) story about love among the classes as well as an examination into proper society and family ties . 

ten year old fanny price ( hannah taylor-gordon , jakob the liar ) , taken from her mother and father and the poverty in which they dwell , is sent to live with her aunt and the privileged class at mansfield park , under the stern patriarchal hand of her uncle , sir thomas bertram ( harold pinter , mojo ) 

spending her days reminded of her lower status , she also invents and writes fanciful stories during her private times . 

fanny eventually grows to become a beautiful , intelligent , and engaging heroine ( quite unlike the original character which ms . austen originally penned in her novel . ) 

writer/director patricia rozema ( when night is falling ) is responsible for the textual changes . 

from a purely dramatic perspective , the revision makes perfect sense and improves the film's audience appeal . 

what ms . rozema has done is to infuse the main character with much of ms . austen's own personality by including excerpts from the author's journals , giving that dialogue to fanny . 

the result is a central character that is immediately appealing . 

as the grown fanny , australian actress frances o'connor ( all about adam ) does wonderfully textured work . 

at times , ms . rozema has fanny address the camera directly to communicate many of the novel's more introspective observations . 

this is a difficult device to work seamlessly into a period film and it is to ms . o'connor's credit that it works as well as it does . 

the central theme which gives the story its legs in an old one . . . 

whether it is better to marry for love or for social standing ? 

fanny has fallen in love with her cousin edmund ( jonny lee miller , plunkett & macleane ) who appears fond of her as well . 

his attentions are soon divided as the stylish and socially acceptable mary crawford ( embeth davidtz , bicentennial man ) enters the picture along with her equally acceptable brother henry ( alessandro nivola , inventing the abbotts ) who eventually sets his romantic sights upon fanny . 

while mary and henry are evidently less than sincere in their affections , their presence does provide the movie and the main characters with the necessary conflict that keeps our interest until the film's appropriately austen-like ending . 

other thematic devices include a awkwardly inserted reference to the source of the wealth of mansfield park . . . 

the slave trade . 

there is also a hint of both lesbianism and incest but neither is carried very far and is soon forgotten . 

the motivation for marriage remains the primary thematic thrust . 

fanny's cousin , maria bertram ( victoria hamilton , persuasion ) is an example of one making a poor match , marrying a well-to-do fool who is able to make her comfortable , but never happy . 

fanny's own mother , trapped in her chosen life of squalor warns fanny by admitting that her situation is due to the fact that she "" married for love . "" 

fanny , given those two terrible examples , and faced with the same choice is understandably indecisive as to which way to lean . 

the spiritual answer , of course , lies in the middle of those two extremes . 

marriage is not a cold , calculating decision based upon self-preservation . 

neither is it a senseless decision made in the warm afterglow of a passionate embrace . 

in the purest sense , marriage forms an insoluble union whereby two people agree to function as one . 

 "" and said , for this cause shall a man leave father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife : and they twain shall be one flesh ? "" 

matthew 19 : 5 [kjv] 

love and logic can be combined . 

god's word contains both . 

so does a marriage based upon his truth . 
"
"funny how your expectations can be defeated , and not in good ways . 

the ghost and the darkness promised ( at least , it seemed to me to promise ) a hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature . 

what it delivered was mystery science theater 3000-level material -- an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters . 

 "" get new jobs ! "" 

was one line , if i remember correctly . 

at the end of the 19th century , col . patterson ( val kilmer , whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr ) is an engineer who has been hired to build a british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda . 

he is having immensely stereotypical problems : the natives are restless , his boss is a jerk , and now two man-eating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off . 

patterson tries to handle the situation himself , incompetently , and then turns to charles remington ( michael douglas ) , a hunter of world reknown ( or something like that ) . 

the movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions , they should have gotten top billing and co-starred with siegfried and roy . 

they are nigh-invulnerable , as one comic book put it , and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature . 

give me a break . 

the movie hasn't got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas ; it's just trying to find convenient ways to stall us . 

even the lion hunts themselves are idiotic . 

get this : remington's big plan is to build a large scaffold-like structure in the middle of the savannah , sit on it , and wait for the lion to show up . 

he does this , and then gets knocked off by a bird . 

by the end of the movie , the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand . 

the acting is forgettable . 

douglas does a good job of portraying a relatively cracked fellow , but it's nothing he hasn't done before . 

kilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else , somewhere else , and the rest vanish into the cinematography . 

the camera , by the way , sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most of the lion attacks are incoherent . 

what did i expect from this movie ? 

i dunno . 

some real excitement , i suppose . 

a sense that there were formidable forces on both sides of this equation . 

no such luck . 

i dug out my tattered copy of hemingway's "" the short happy life of francis macomber "" and read that to get the taste of this movie out of my mind . 
"
"it's not a bad thing to update old stories . 

it's done all the time in the oral tradition . 

the difficulty with this film is not that the tale has changed , it's that it's dry . 

the new cinderella , danielle ( drew barrymore ) is not sitting around waiting for her prince to come . 

she's a woman of the late twentieth century albeit situated in sixteenth century france . 

when her father dies , she stays on in his house even though she is mistreated by her wicked stepmother rodmilla ( anjelica huston ) . 

she works by day , but reads sir thomas more by firelight at night . 

although the story is updated , you know the plot . 

danielle meets prince henry ( dougray scott ) , goes to a ball disguised , is later found out and they live happily ever after . 

the movie is often like watching a filmed play . 

theater in real life is engrossing . 

theater on the screen is usually lifeless . 

there doesn't seem to be much going on . 

the camera can be a star of films . 

here it's a co-conspirator . 

danielle's convictions are compromised . 

a socialist and a feminist , she pretends to be royalty to get her man . 

a kind woman , her last act in the movie is one of revenge . 

the most enjoyable characters are the most cartoonish . 

the fairy godmother stand-in , leonardo da vinci ( patrick godfrey ) is fun to watch as the eccentric old man who advises danielle . 

huston is enjoyable in her over-the-top wickedness . 

in all fairness , my companion loved the film . 

maybe it's one of those "" chick flicks "" that men don't like . 

it is certainly a date film . 

nearly the entire audience was couples . 

oh well , maybe it's good for something . 
"
"lengthy and lousy are two words to describe the boring drama the english patient . 

great acting , music and cinematography were nice , but too many dull sub-plots and characters made the film hard to follow . 

ralph fiennes ( strange days , schindler's list ) gives a gripping performance as count laszlo almasy , a victim of amnesia and horrible burns after world war ii in italy . 

the story revolves around his past , in flashback form , making it even more confusing . 

anyway , he is taken in by hana ( juliette binoche , the horseman on the roof ) , a boring war-torn nurse . 

she was never really made into anything , until she met an indian towards the end , developing yet another sub-plot . 

count almasy begins to remember what happened to him as it is explained by a stranger ( willem dafoe , basquiat ) . 

his love ( kirstin scott thomas , mission impossible ) was severely injured in a plane crash , and eventually died in a cave . 

he returned to find her dead and was heart-broken . 

so he flew her dead body somewhere , but was shot down from the ground . 

don't get the wrong idea , it may sound good and the trailer may be tempting , but good is the last thing this film is . 

maybe if it were an hour less , it may have been tolerable , but 2 hours and 40 minutes of talking is too much to handle . 

the only redeeming qualities about this film are the fine acting of fiennes and dafoe and the beautiful desert cinematography . 

other than these , the english patient is full of worthless scenes of boredom and wastes entirely too much film . 

 , 
"
"if the current trends of hollywood filmmaking continue , we are probably five or six years away from the moment when the 1980s would become the next golden age of movie nostalgia . 

although some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories ( mostly in ironic way , like grosse pointe blank and romy & michelle's high school reunion ) , some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones . 

until that happens , 1980s would be remembered as the decade of greed , when the revolutionary ideals of 1960s turned into its cruel , materialistic opposite and the money became the only thing that matters . 

contemporary movies are good in illustrating what was bad for the people who had to live in those times . 

one of such movies , one that probably brings the essence of 1980s to the screen , is william friedkin's to live and die in l . a . 

the money isn't just the symbolic motive in the film , it is the major elements of the plot . 

rick masters ( willem dafoe ) is an ex-convict who used his artistic abilities in order to become one of the best counterfeiters in l . a . being too intelligent to fall into police traps , and ruthless enough to eliminate anybody or anything that could jeopardise his career , masters managed to elude law for years and became well- connected . 

richard chance ( william l . petersen ) is a secret service agent , adrenaline junkie whose life gets new meaning after his partner got killed by masters . 

however , his plans of bringing the counterfeiter down meet one obstacle after another . 

finally he sets up a final sting , but his superiors deny him the necessary money . 

being frustrated , and against the reluctance of his new partner john vukovich ( bill pankow ) , he decides to get the money by robbing underworld courier . 

their plan backfires with almost tragic consequences when their target turns out to be undercover fbi agent , but chance decides to carry out his scheme anyway . 

like french connection , one of his previous masterpieces , this friedkin's movie was inspired by real life . 

gerrald petievich , author of the novel that later served as basis for his screenplay , spent many years working as a secret service agent . 

that turned to be useful for the portrayal of that law enforcement agency , not much utilised by hollywood . 

secret service millieu was also cleverly used in order to bring the viewer into the decade of greed ; the beginning scene where the movie's hero works as a part of presidential security detail is a nice opportunity to hear reagan's speech that could illustrate the political and economical notions of those times . 

ultramaterialistic and egotistical view of the world is shared by almost any character in the movie . 

willem dafoe brilliantly portrays dangerous and intelligent psychopath , whose ruthlessness and lack of any moral fibber doesn't seem like affliction in the reagan years ; on the contrary , those qualities actually makes masters socially acceptable . 

compared with him , and all the other side characters that want their "" piece of the action "" , two heroes on the side of law seem like losers . 

instead of being a classical good guy , secret service agent richard chance ( portrayed by william petersen in his most impressive role so far ) is nothing more than a lunatic whose adrenaline addiction and madness work against his better judgement ; his sidekick , who should serve as those "" better judgement "" is a weakling and sentimental fool that gets suckered in the end . 

in such surroundings of moral decay , the not so happy , yet surprising ending doesn't seem out of line ( although the very last shot leaves too much questions unanswered ) . 

the dark atmosphere of l . a . - city of glamour and moral decay - is nicely captured by william friedkin's directing skills . 

the tight and realistic scripts with memorable characters ( portrayed by such capable actors like john turturro , dean stockwell , debra feuer , darlanne fleugel and steve james ) gave opportunity for friedkin to use another gimmick that made him famous in his 1971 masterpiece - great car chase . 

that scene alone , with lot of realism , thrills and surprise twists , is worth seeing the rest of the film . 

the soundtrack , provided by now almost forgotten band "" wang chung "" , is also one of the more memorable of that decade . 

in every case , to live and die in l . a . is one of the rare movies in which hollywood actually tries to tell some unflattering truths about the world and succeeds in it . 
"
"luckily , some people got starship troopers . 

some people knew it was supposed to be silly . 

for those of you who didn't , how could you miss it ? 

from the very beginning , when we see an interactive internet-like promotional video for the armed forces of the future , it should be obvious this film is to be taken lightly . 

i guess without blatant one-liners and home alone style slapstick , some people just don't recognize such goofy humor . 

such a dry approach to such intentionally campy humor must have left some disillusioned . 

first thing to do before seeing this movie - lighten up . 

meet the equivalent of "" beverly hills 90210 "" meets "" mighty morphin power rangers "" . 

four close friends are now graduating high school and are ready to join the armed forces , which , in the future , means fighting for the whole galaxy and not just your country . 

johnny rico ( casper van dien ) is ready to join the infantry , mostly because his girlfriend carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) has enlisted to be a pilot . 

dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) has enlisted as a trooper , and it's possible she's joining merely to follow rico , whom she's always had eyes for . 

if you saw these three on the street , you'd automatically start searching for the fashion designers and photographers , for never has a movie's cast looked so much like the cut-out cover of "" seventeen "" magazine . 

the lone non-supermodel , carl jenkins ( played by doogie howser himself , neil patrick harris ) is the brainiac who gets into the military intelligence division , the top secret department that pretty much leaves doogie - er , carl out of the picture . 

 ( good call - now we can put all our drooling efforts into only the most deserving of characters ) . 

right off the bat , rico becomes the star of the show , far surpassing all the other soldiers and becoming squadron leader in a short period of time . 

but a horrific accident during a standard training exercise ( which follows all to closely to his breakup with carmen ) leaves rico ready to call it quits . 

with his bags packed and his civilian clothes back on , johnny is ready to walk off base and catch the next flight home . 

well sorry , rico suave , but there's no place like home , especially after gigantic alien insects have destroyed it . 

that's right , the planet is being attacked by a colony of arachnid-like alien beings that a can of raid just isn't going to destroy . 

with a sudden change of heart ( and clothes ) , rico is back in the game , following his fellow starship troopers off to fight a mean group of daddy long legs . 

what starship troopers really is , is a spoof of all that it even remotely touches on - the soap opera like love affairs of high school , the love for sci-fi and thirst for gore shared by this same age group , etc . nothing is taken seriously . 

it's almost as much a satire on young adults as clueless , but with its sly and futuristic approach , it's not as recognizably so . 

it's a spoof so subtle that many won't recognize the spoofery . 

if you deem this as sci-fi/action , you're wrong . 

it's sci-fi/action/comedy , with the comedy being on the level of such cult favorites as evil dead 2 . starship troopers just may be on the road to cult status as well . 

gore is a factor heavily brought up in reviews of this film , but the gore , too , is meant to be cheesy . 

yes , it's graphic , but it's also brutally phony , and that's what makes it such great fun to watch . 

not since the old "" mr . bill "" skits on "" saturday night live "" has torture and mutilation been such a joy to watch . 

people were laughing out loud every time a body was severed in half or a head was viciously decapitated . 

perhaps it brings back fond memories of the severities we inflicted upon our sisters' barbie dolls as young children . 

with the actors resembling ken and barbie so closely , it's a good chance this is the case , whether we're fully aware of it or not . 

starship troopers has it's slow parts , but it's truly an alternative to your typical sci-fi/action flick or lame juvenile comedy . 

aside from the intentionally cheesy gore , the special effects are quite astounding . 

when the spaceship passes a meteor , it's quite an awesome spectacle , visually crisp and captivating . 

if you're looking for brainless fun , this is the epitome of your search . 

a beautiful cast , awesome special effects , fast-paced action , campy acting , and a whole lot of gore . 

this is brainless heaven . 

just remember not to think .

"david spade has a snide , sarcastic sense of humor that works perfectly on the tv sitcom just shoot me . 

it also served as a good showcase for him when he co-starred , opposite the late chris farley , in tommy boy and black sheep . 

lost and found marks the comedian's first attempt at going solo in a movie , and it also reveals that when spade doesn't have a reliable back-up system , his brand of humor seems more desperate than one may expect . 

david spade is not the problem with lost and found . 

he plays dylan ramsey , the sweet main character , to the best of his abilities . 

the story revolves around dylan's obsessions with his beautiful new neighbour , lila dubois ( sophie marceau , from braveheart ) , and her terrier named jack . 

dylan believes that the best way to a woman's heart is through her dog . 

and so he kidnaps jack , planning to stage a fake rescue , in hope to win lila over . 

there are three good things about lost and found . 

the first is spade . 

the second is sophie marceau , a lovely actress who's been planted into the wrong movie . 

lastly , there's the dog , who is used here in a similar context to puffy from there's something about mary . 

unfortunately , director jeff pollack finds more humor in putting jack through a cycle in the drier than he does with simply making him look cute . 

this kind of physical humor is dead . 

pollack does everything but beat the poor pooch with a baseball bat to get laughs , and this procedure is cheap , unfunny and resoundingly cruel . 

this is where i start to get fuzzy . 

also in this unusual blend is ( apparently ) a sweet-natured love story between dylan and lila . 

given the mean-spirited comedy that the movie is obviously striving for , i found this hard to swallow . 

and , why does dylan even deserve someone like lila , after kidnapping her precious dog and putting it through such pain ? 

predictably , lost and found opts for a happy ending , one that feels so sentimental , gooey , and rings so false that it sets off a siren in your head that makes you feel a bit cheated . 

david spade ( who also co-wrote the movie ) tries hard , so very hard , to make this project amusing . 

there are some choice scenes that are quite funny , but the movie is only sporadically funny . 

patrick bruel plays the stock character of rene , the pompous jerk who also wants to win lila over , with his good looks and money . 

jon lovitz and martin sheen are welcome additions in two tiny supporting roles . 

despite a few positive attributes , lost and found just doesn't work . 

if you're searching for an enjoyable romantic-comedy , you could do far better than this obvious , misguided failure that shows a blatant disregard for what it's trying to present .

"this british import follows the ( mis- ) adventures of a group of heroin crazed scottish youths . 

there is marc renton ( who narrates ) , spud ( the dim-witted one ) sick boy ( the sean connery obsessive ) , and begbee ( the violence obsessive ) . 

powered by a top rate , but not top name soundtrack ( iggy pop , sleeper , elastica , lou reed . . . ) the film follows renton who gets clean , gets back into heroin and gets clean again . 

some of the wit in this movie is sharp and pulp fiction-esque , and some is just dumb & dumber gross ( the bed sheets ) and stupid ( the bb gun ) although the film starts out on a comic note , it takes a sharp term in the middle , and becomes almost depressing . 

the film is based on an irving welsh novel bearing the same title . 

i can honestly say that this is one of the best movies i have ever seen . 

it is an obscure gem that has been over shadowed in the us by such movies as mission impossible and id4 . 

the film is hard to follow with the heavy accents of the actors . 

this is a very original film , as far as films go today . 

it definetly deserves multiple viewings ( partly because of the slang and accents ) jeremy dennison mr . orange@centuryinter . net

"american pie 2 is filled with laughs . 

but they are mostly cheap ones built primarily upon sexual degradation and adolescent humor more fit for a locker room than a movie theater . 

i'm no prude and i admit to laughing along with everyone else at the preview screening to this sequel to the 1999 hit comedy . 

but the laughs are built on discomfort and embarrassment , not on any intrinsic humor from within the story itself . 

what separates american pie 2 from its predecessor is heart . 

of the original , i noted it was "" a warm , pleasant outing about the travails of growing up . "" 

well , the quartet of chums - jim ( jason biggs ) , oz ( chris klein ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) - have grown up . 

at least they are a year older , but don't seem any wiser . 

fresh from their first year of college the quartet , along with the obnoxious stifler ( seann william scott ) , rent a summer house by the lake in order to attract girls in an attempt to score . 

as usual nothing goes right until the last reel . 

but what we are left with is five guys spending nearly two hours drooling over various young women . 

and american pie 2 is rather degrading to women . 

for the most part , they are not shown as individuals . 

they are nothing more than potential recipients of over-active , raging hormones . 

it is telling that the most normal couple , oz and heather ( mena suvari ) spend the bulk of the film trying to have phone sex - she's overseas on an exchange student program . 

despite having been to college , jim is still klutzy and awkward , unsure of himself around the opposite sex . 

most of the pratfalls and humiliations are heaped upon him , including a painful episode involving an instant glue-like substance . 

also uncomfortable to watch is a sequence involving three of the lads with two young women roommates , whom the boys suspect of being lesbians . 

it is offensive and plays upon outdated , adolescent stereotypes to generate laughs . 

the first film , despite some raunchy moments , had an innocent charm to it . 

the sequel is more cynical . 

it knows what its predominantly male audience members want and unabashedly gives it to them : the many mentions of finch's encounter with stifler's mom becomes a tiresome running gag throughout as does eugene levy's return as jim's well-meaning , trying-to-be-hip dad . 

the only performer who is actually given some new , fresh material is alyson hannigan as michelle , the band geek from the original . 

in the sequel , she imbues her character with vulnerability , wisdom and maturity . 

american pie 2 is a pre-sold commodity that will earn several million at the box office . 

it is a shame , though , that in its rush to rake in some bucks screenwriter adam herz , who also penned the original , could not have set his sights higher . 

american pie 2 is funny , but it's still a comedown as well as a letdown .

"i'm a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson's work . 

he always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain . 

with teaching mrs . tingle , his directorial debut , williamson has reached the end of his rope . 

what used to be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here . 

the components are all there , including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to . 

but where are the thrills ? 

the laughs ? 

both are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge . 

and what a shame that is . 

i loved the scream films - heck , i even enjoyed the sci-fi goofiness of the faculty . 

kevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office . 

teaching mrs . tingle , a black comedy that will leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers , may put an end to his reign . 

or perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties . 

i still have my faith , but i fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo of the past . 

the title character of his pet project is a vicious , uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously over-the-top by british actress helen mirren . 

mrs . tingle is basically every student's worst nightmare : a heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most hard-working of her pupils . 

the principal ( michael mckean ) is horrified of her , and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members . 

i enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way . 

mirren's performance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink . 

in other words , it's a poor substitute for williamson's best work . 

the plot is a big problem here . 

material that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the director . 

the likable katie holmes plays leigh ann , an over-achiever hoping to get a college scholarship . 

but typical mrs . tingle says her history project , which she worked on for countless hours , is laughable . 

later on while studying in the gymnasium , a classmate ( barry watson ) offers her a photo-copied duplicate of mrs . tingle's final exam . 

leigh ann's best friend ( marisa coughlan ) encourages her to use it . 

alas , the old hag herself finds the three scheming , and snatches the test , and prepares to talk to the principal in the morning . 

in the morning . . . 

how convenient ! 

the three students head to mrs . tingle's house , attempting to set the facts straight and clear leigh ann's name . 

things get out of hand , and the teacher gets knocked unconscious in a tussle . 

the plan is to tie her to a bed and try to get some reasoning out of her . 

of course , not everything goes entirely to plan . 

besides pointless sub-plots involving the football coach ( jeffrey tambor , horribly wasted ) , there is little by way of actual progress . 

there is no urgency to the situation ; little tension or laughs are involved . 

the humor is completely inconsistent . 

after many of the jokes , the theater was so silent i could have heard a fly sneeze . 

you continue to await some momentum in the story , something that could possibly revive the slow pace . 

a moment like that never arises . 

williamson also does a handsome job of wasting some of the key supporting players , including the talented mckean and larry sanders' vet tambor . 

and the beautiful vivica a . fox has one lifeless scene as a caring guidance counselor , and then williamson disposes of her character entirely . 

on the plus side , holmes and coughlan are admirable ( with the latter giving a frighteningly believable exorcism impression ) , and molly ringwald has an amusing cameo appearance as a substitute teacher . 

while everything is pretty lifeless , teaching mrs . tingle remains watchable . 

there are a few promising ideas that pop up now and again , but anything remotely interesting is squandered by the inane script . 

mirren is easily the best reason to keep watching . 

she is convincingly evil and fun to watch , but even her gifted delivery can't save individual scenes that flounder in boredom . 

if there is one word for the movie surrounding her , it would be `disappointing' . 

basically , kevin williamson is his worst enemy here . 

his uneventful direction prevents any aspects of his screenplay to be appreciated ( not that his writing here is especially good ) . 

we will see , when rookie screenwriter ehren kruger writes the third installment in the scream franchise this christmas , whether williamson is for real . 
"
"trekkies , roger nygard's energetic and hilarious documentary , brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions . 

the beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and non-fans alike . 

 ( the film generally writes off the trekkies vs . trekker polemic as not worth arguing about . ) 

the good-spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable , loud giggles , yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and a certain awe . 

denise crosby , who played tasha yar on "" star trek : the next generation , "" serves as the host . 

in the opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary ( oed ) . 

 ( the oed cites a february , 1976 caption in the "" new yorker "" as the first recorded usage of the word . ) 

unless you've been to the conventions , i posit that you have no idea of the dedication of some of the fans . 

one pointed out , apologetically , that the stripe on his new uniform was slightly inaccurate . 

others talked about how many star trek conventions they had attended , several dozen being typical and hundreds not unheard of . 

my personal favorite fan is sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams . 

arguably the most famous of all the trekkies , she wears her uniform every waking hour as many die-hard fans do . 

her claim to fame is that , as a juror on the whitewater trial , she wore it in court as well . 

 "" every day i would walk past the reporters with a vulcan-like stoicism , "" she says , describing her way of dealing with the crowd of reporters who became obsessed with her obsession . 

she doesn't quite understand all of the uproar . 

 "" i'm an officer of the federation 24 hours a day , "" she reminds us . 

her fealty to her hobby approaches that of a religious faith . 

along with the laugher the show evokes , there is an equal measure of sincere appreciation for people with such loyalty . 

and their infectious joy provokes a certain envy of their enjoyment . 

few other avocations could give this much satisfaction . 

these people are having the time of their lives . 

 ( for the record , i'm not a star trek fan although i have seen some of the movies . ) 

the film interviews the various star trek series's stars as well as its fans . 

the stars had thought the convention idea was a lark and would soon fade , but over twenty years later , the conventions are still going strong . 

filled with anecdotes , the show talks about the happenings at the various conventions . 

at one , the actor who plays q was so sick that he thought he would have to cancel . 

after appearing briefly , he drank some water and left . 

they decided to auction off his half-empty glass , joking that it had the "" q virus . "" 

the guy who won the bidding immediately drank the water and screamed to the crowd that he now had the q virus too . 

with dedication comes a certain amount of stupidity . 

not just flitting among people , the documentary takes the time to let you get to know the trekkies . 

one guy is a trekkie cross-dresser , another dresses her cat , and then there is the dentist . 

the dentist has his entire office made up to look like a star trek set . 

he , his oral hygienists , his receptionist , his wife , and his kids wear the outfits all of the time . 

it appears that his workers are permitted to take them off when they go home , but not his family . 

for variety , he and his family do change characters from time to time . 

he says his patients like it . 

well , there was this one complainer , but he had a problem with his bill anyway . 

there are summer schools for klingon with ph . d . linguists to teach the language . 

hamlet is now available in klingon , albeit perhaps not at your local bookstore , and they are working on translating the bible . 

they even sell united federation passports that are real enough that trekkies have used them to fool customs , even u . s . customs . 

the movie bogs down only briefly when it tries to argue the series's larger meaning about diversity and humanitarian concerns . 

sandwiched in-between the levity , the switch in tone doesn't work . 

the incessantly up-beat film ends with a singing elvis impersonator . 

he fits right in . 

trekkies runs a breezy 1 : 26 . 

it is not rated but would be pg for brief sexual references and would be fine for all ages . 
"
"lisa cholodenko's "" high art , "" is an intelligent , quiet drama . 

its strongest quality , aside from the top-notch central performances , is the perceptive way in which the film , also written by cholodenko , observes its characters . 

they are all flawed people , some more troubled than others , but they are not judged . 

judging the characters in this picture would be a creative misstep on the filmmakers' parts , because no one , no matter how bad off they are , deserve to be negatively judged if they are involved in some serious problems that they cannot break free of . 

syd ( radha mitchell ) , a 24-year-old woman living with her longtime boyfriend james ( gabriel mann ) , has recently been awarded an ideal job at the high-profile photography magazine , "" frame . "" 

she very much enjoys where her career is headed , but is often not taken very seriously by her managers , who are always giving her petty jobs to do , when she knows she could be doing more important things . 

one night , while taking a bath , syd notices a leak coming from the apartment above hers , so when she goes up there to inform them of it , she meets lucy beliner ( ally sheedy ) , a thin , worn-out , and unhappy woman , who lives with her drug-addicted german girlfriend , greta ( patricia clarkson ) , a pathetic former actress who is usually so out-of-it that she often is in and out of conciousness . 

syd quickly strikes up a conversation with lucy , and discovers that she used to be an acclaimed photographer ten years before . 

lucy claims she doesn't want to get back into the profession , but syd manages to convince the "" frame "" editors to do a piece on her work . 

all the while , syd begins to grow deep feelings for lucy , even though she has never previously been attracted to a woman , and lucy starts a battle with her personal demons . 

 "" high art , "" is such an effective motion picture because it is never suger-coated or idealized , but instead an honest and convincing portrait of a handful of unhappy people whose lives are going nowhere , while syd's luck begins to rise . 

the film in no way is about lesbianism , but about love , which was a refreshing change of pace from the usual stereotypical portraits of homosexuality . 

as lucy and syd grow closer and closer together , we really do believe that they are falling in love with each other , even if the relationship might be doomed . 

with this picture , ally sheedy's star has risen once again , thanks to her touching , nearly flawless portrtayal of lucy , a woman who , in the course of a decade , has found her life consumed almost entirely by drugs , which has taken away her once-blossoming career . 

her characted really is tragic , and one particular scene involving lucy and her mother , in which lucy admits to her that she has a drug problem , and her mother matter-of-factly responds by saying she can't help her , is heartbreaking . 

although not autobiographical , sheedy has had drug problems in her past , and i suspect she brought that knowledge of already being in lucy's footsteps to her role . 

also very good is radha mitchell as syd , who previously starred in the slight 1997 australian comedy , "" love and other catastrophes , "" wh caught me by surprise with her performance . 

easily being able to pass as christina ricci's older sister , mitchell obtains the same natural charisma that has made ricci so popular recently . 

as accurate as almost every detail is in , "" high art , "" i wish the relationship had been more tightly written involving syd and james , who , played by gabriel mann , is left with a throwaway role . 

by the time he finds out about syd and lucy , he disappears from the film , and i wish there had been another scene where they confronted each other . 

this is a very minor fault , however , in a film that is full of riches . 

although many of the characters are stuck in a hopeless pit of despair , syd and lucy are intelligent people who recognize their problems . 

the character of dominique ( anh duong ) , the "" frame "" editor who decides to give syd a chance with her ideas , was also written to be far more mature than expected . 

and the one sex scene in the film was beautifully and originally done . 

for once , it did not invlove steaminess , or violent sexual activity , or gratuitous nudity , but focused on the actual characters , who love each other , and their insecurities involved in making the decision to actually have sex . 

 "" high art , "" which won the screenwriting award at the 1998 sundance film festival , marks the superior feature film debut of cholodenko , as well as sheedy's strongest , and best , role to date .

"this is not a simple plan about finding a plane load of money and getting away with the cash . 

this is more about a parable of greed , and how money can become the bane of your life . 

yes , there are elements of ? fargo' here ( the snow and cold ) , although not as vivid in the blood and gore department . 

it shows how greed can set of a chain of events leading to death and the destruction of lives . 

and how at the end of the day , the things that matter most are love , truth and honesty . 

although in one sense it may seem tedious , making a movie about the ugliness of greed ( not box office material ) , it does become tedious , not because of the morale ending , but because one expects the movie to end that way . 

this becomes apparent after the first murder to cover up the crime , the rest of the movie just spirals downward from there . 

the characters in this drama are a mixture of simple and intellectual folk , brothers and friends , who all fall prey to the avarice of money . 

they should have perhaps thrown in someone sensible , level headed and not affected by greed to give the party more balance . 

commendable is the exceptional performance of billy bob thornton , whose portrayal of the simpleton brother was masterful . 

bill paxton also gives a powerful performance as the greedier younger brother , whilst bridget fonda is convincing as the greediest wife , who indirectly causes the most problems . 

fill a room full of greedy people and several million dollars , and you will end up with a simple recipe for a blood bath . 

it's not a simple plan , when you shoot everyone you love for money , unless you're the menendez brothers .

"ingredients : starving artist lusting after a beautiful woman from his childhood 

synopsis : great expectations ( 1998 ) is a modernized version of a charles dickens novel . 

in the original charles dickens classic an orphan boy named pip learns about life through his friendship with an escaped convict , his relationship with a bitter old lady named miss havisham , and his hopeless lifetime infatuation with havisham's snobbish adopted daughter , estella . 

the gist of the story is that an anonymous benefactor sends pip to london for pip to become an upper class "" gentleman . "" 

pip leaves for london with "" great expectations "" to be groomed into a gentleman so that he can one day be classy enough to marry estella . 

but life has a way of complicating things . 

pip becomes an arrogant s . o . b . 

until he learns just who his secret benefactor is . 

in this new 1998 version of great expectations a poor florida lad named finn ( ethan hawke ) with a talent for drawing has an early memory of helping an escaped convict ( robert de niro ) . 

but soon the focus of finn's life becomes romance , as he develops a lifelong infatuation with estella ( gwyneth paltrow ) , an upper crust girl with some psychological and emotional issues due to being raised in a dysfunctional environment . 

estella was raised in wealth by ms . dinsmoor ( anne bancroft ) , an eccentric , aged and embittered , man-hating single aunt whose groom left her abandoned at the altar on the day of her marriage . 

this causes estella to 'fear the daylight' of relationships , but finn thinks it's just a case of snobbery . 

when finn becomes a young man , an anonymous benefactor sets finn up in new york with the connections and publicity to be groomed into a famous artist . 

finn leaves florida with "" great expectations "" to be a successful artist so that some day he might become classy enough to marry the snobbish estella . 

what will happen to all of finn's "" great expectations ? "" 

opinion : if you're looking for a romance with a happy ending , look no further ; you've found one here . 

ethan hawke is romantic lead . 

 ( he romanced winona ryder in reality bites . 

he romanced julie delpy in before sunrise . 

he romanced uma thurman in gattaca . 

now in great expectations he gets to chase gwyneth paltrow , a rail-thin blonde . ) 

hawke plays a lovestruck , earnest and unchanged finn throughout the film . 

meanwhile paltrow portrays estella as alternating between infuriating tease and ice princess ; estella's whole purpose is to get men to fall in love and then hurt them rather than become intimate . 

anne bancroft goes a little overboard as the deranged and pessimistic ms . dinsmoor , while robert de niro carries off the convict part suitably . 

the difference between the classic dickens novel and this 1998 adaptation is that the dickens novel is ripe with deep and timeless themes about class struggle and love , whereas great expectations ( 1998 ) is more artsy , less complicated story about a 1990s artist dealing with a lifetime tease . 
"
"when i saw the trailer for this film , i laughed harder than i had in quite some time . 

while i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it , i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good . 

i'm happy to say that there's something about mary is not one of those trailer let-downs . 

in fact , watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours . 

the film opens up in flashback to 1985 , at a high school in cumberland , rhode island . 

ted stroehmann ( ben stiller ) is a social reject who can't seem to get a date to the upcoming prom , until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren ( w . 

earl brown ) , who's being harassed by one of the school jocks . 

it seems warren's sister is the campus queen , mary jensen ( cameron diaz ) , who is impressed with ted's willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother , despite a very real chance of getting beaten up . 

mary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom . 

ted was just flattered that she even knew his name . 

unfortunately , prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper ( at which every man in the theater will wince ) , and is sent to the hospital . 

fast forward to the present , where ted has cleaned himself up , now writes for a magazine , but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years : mary , whom he hasn't seen since that fateful day . 

with the help of his friend dom ( chris elliott ) , ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy ( matt dillon ) to track down his only love . 

however , when pat finds mary , he falls for her too , and soon the both of them are competing for her affections . 

there's something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly , who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin . 

not exactly intelligent comedies , they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co-workers to think you had such a great time watching them . 

with their current film , the farrelly brothers have come up with something you'll not only enjoy , but also won't mind talking about the next day at the water cooler . 

the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles , from the subtle to the ridiculous , and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some ( seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers' last two films ) they almost all work . 

i have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on . 

one minute you'll be laughing at something ted says , and the next you'll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary's apartment . 

one of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller . 

he is perfectly cast in the role of ted , because he's a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation . 

ted's a nice fellow and tries to do his best , but for some reason or another things just don't always work out . 

it's comical , but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top . 

actually , i've liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid-eighties . 

the film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise/paul newman film the color of money , entitled the hustler of money . 

in it , stiller played wince ( not vince ) who is taken under the wing of an older man ( played by john mahoney ) to become a big-time bowling hustler . 

it was parody at its finest , more of which showed up in the short-lived "" the ben stiller show "" on the fox network in late '92/early '93 . 

like "" the critic "" ( which aired on abc , then fox ) , i still mourn that show's cancellation . 

cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film , although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates , and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper-thin at times . 

however , diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm , that you can still see why she's got guys just falling over each other to be with her . 

heck , i even found her laugh to be cute , even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week . 

my girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn't change , and you know , it's really true . 

he and ralph macchio must hang out or something . 

maybe they live in dick clark's pool house . 

anyway , here's another good piece of casting , as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into mary's heart . 

the supporting performances are also good . 

chris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss ( yes , check it out next time ) , and less annoying than in cabin boy . 

lin shae , who plays mary's neighbor magda ( and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin ) , provides some good laughs , especially in scenes with her benji-like dog , which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film . 

lee evans , as mary's friend tucker , displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist . 

the farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j . strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren't any noticeable times where the film drags . 

the only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes . 

they appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot-relevant information right toward the camera . 

it's a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film . 

after that it got a little annoying , and it's unfortunate that those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow . 

fortunately , filled with sight gags , humorous lines , and solid comedic acting , there's something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater .

"summary five liberal iowa graduate students share a house and carry on a tradition of a large sunday dinner . 

for a year now they have been inviting a guest for dinner and discussion . 

on this occasion one of the roommates , pete ( ron eldard ) , brings home a stranger who picked him up when his car broke down . 

the stranger is zack ( bill paxton ) who appears like a decent enough good samaritan . 

nothing could be further from the truth . 

after some dinner conversation it appears that zack is , among other things , a racist "" you know my grandfather once said that if he knew you coloreds were going to be so much trouble we'd have picked the damn cotton ourselves "" , and an anti-semite . 

an argument escalates at the dinner table and leads to violence . 

after zack assaults marc ( jonathan penner ) and pete , zack is killed . 

the roommates are at odds with what to do . 

marc , pete and paulie ( annabeth gish ) immediately wish to call the police . 

luke ( courtney b . vance ) and jude ( cameron diaz ) suggest something different . 

after more discussion they agree to dispose of the body and cover it up . 

they do not want to be sent to jail for what they feel was a justifiable homicide . 

when it is done the roommates realize that it was easier than they thought . 

so easy in fact that they decide that every sunday their dinner guest would be someone who opposes of their views . 

if they all agree that the guest deserves to die , they will poison them and bury them in the back yard . 

the back yard fills up rather quickly , its' victims including ( among others ) a right to life extremist , an anti-environmentalist and a homophobe . 

by the time the roommates get to their tenth victim they begin to question their methods . 

are they giving the guests a chance ? 

are they even giving them good food anymore ? 

this film is what i like to call a "" hidden treasure "" . 

this film is such a pleasant surprise . 

a well written , devilish satire that is funny , sexy and original . 

this film should be a hit , but i guess the fact that it apparently had no marketing wouldn't give it much of a chance . 

i had never heard of it until i saw a copy at my video store . 

stacy title does a wonderful job directing . 

she somehow finds the time to give all of the characters enough screen time to develop a distinct personality . 

>from the five members of the house to other key characters including sheriff stanley ( nora dunn ) , the local law closing in on the truth , and the dream dinner guest , norman arbuthnot ( ron perlman ) , a rush limbaugh clone who should be the roommates easiest kill . 

perlman gives the films' best performance . 

he finds the right note as the right wing big mouth who simultaneously offends and gains followers , and may just inadvertently talk his way out of death . 

the other actors are convincing as well , as all of the roommates deal with their murderous ways . 

some of the characters appear to be heading down the road towards insanity , while others grieve their decisions . 

when friends ask me to recommend a movie , this is usually the first one i think of . 

i am not saying that this is my favorite movie ( although it is in my top ten ) , but because the film was such a wonderful surprise , i have a fondness for it . 

i also try to recommend films like this : ones that have not been seen by many people , but should .

"when i first heard about scream in 1996 , i was told that it was a spoof of horror movies . 

from the master of the horror himself , wes craven , it ridiculed the cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them , by making the teenagers do what they know they're not supposed to do when a serial killer is stalking them ( don't run up the stairs when you can easily go out the front door , never say "" i'll be right back , "" etc . ) . 

when i first heard this description , i figured that it was an easy way out of making a bad movie . 

how hard is it to make an extremely terrible film but claim it is actually a mockery of other bad movies . 

was this wes craven's remedy from making "" real "" bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn ? 

it just seemed cheap to me . 

then i actually saw the movie and the first twenty minutes , involving drew barrymore and a nail-bitingly intense phone conversation , completely changed my attitude . 

scream is not only a clever parody of your standard horror flick , it's also a pretty scary movie . 

if you've seen a million of these kinds of films , you know exactly what is going to happen . 

this is part of the fun of watching scream . 

the movie reminds avid horror fans how similar and repetitive the genre is and it also reminds them how great a guilty pleasure it can be to watch pointless and predictable violence to innocent , attractive teenagers . 

to those who rarely see these types of movies , scream is a thrilling unpredictable ride that could be mistaken as a serious slasher film . 

there's nothing wrong with that misjudgment though . 

i have witnessed viewers from both sides of the audience , the newbies to horror and the fanatics . 

their opinions on the film were so different but both very positive . 

from these varied reviews , i am convinced that scream has not only revived the teen horror movie and the normal teen romance movies but also the hilarious parodies of these and other categories . 

films that both deride and celebrate genres like galaxy quest and the big hit would not have existed , in my opinion , if it was not for the outstanding success of scream . 

the low - budget 1996 gem may , alongside pulp fiction , be the most influential film of the 1990's . 

this influence may exist to the chagrin of some moviegoers who despise movies like teaching mrs . tingle or television programs such as dawson's creek but to others such as myself , we congratulate the movie that has opened new doors for excellent young actors , screenwriters , and directors . 

scream is also an extremely funny movie thanks to its quickly-paced script by kevin williamson . 

within the film are characters who tell other characters , as well as the audience , the basic rules and cliches of a horror movie . 

mainly from the rants of randy ( jamie kennedy ) and stu ( matthew lillard ) , we are reminded not only of the obvious and hilarious rules but also some of the more subtle stereotypes that when thought over are mostly true as well ( the virgin always survives ; have sex and you're dead meat ) . 

not only are we treated these rules on a plate but also the rules are referenced to a number of different films and actors . 

the script feels like an obsessive essay from a college film geek who has nothing better to do but find every little blunder from every little film for his own self-satisfaction . 

in this case , williamson finds these errors for the audience's satisfaction and amusement . 

i hear there is a new movie coming out called scary movie which is a spoof of scream , which is a spoof of scary movies . 

i will certainly see the film but i have the feeling that this parody will be more obviously ridiculing the genre rather than scream's perfect subtlety . 

however my last gut feeling about this stuff , scream , was dead wrong . . . 

so who knows . 
"
"a backdrop of new year's eve in 1981 would seem to lend itself to a great party movie . 

the decor possibilities are endless - disco balls had yet to migrate into the dark corners of the attic , big hair was worth its weight in aquanet , and the louder the fashion , the better the look . 

but despite this setting , these details and a soundtrack that includes some 40-plus irresistible hits from the early days of the me decade , something is inherently wrong with "" 200 cigarettes . "" 

a better title for this nostalgic mess would be "" 50 missed opportunities . "" 

what is it that makes this retro-comedy such a downer ? 

it's certainly not the cast , which includes enough hot , young talent for several movies . 

there's courtney love , cementing her reputation as a serious actress ; christina ricci , hot off her shoulda-been-nominated turn in "" the opposite of sex "" ; paul rudd , who gets even more appealing with every role ; kate hudson , inheriting some fine acting genes from mom goldie hawn ; and affleck brothers ben and casey , two of the best things about "" good will hunting . "" 

perhaps the question is this : what drew these and other immensely talented actors to such a dreary project ? 

maybe it looked good on paper . 

 "" 200 cigarettes "" is composed of a series of vignettes , as various characters make their way through new york's festively decorated east village to a holiday bash thrown by a jittery bundle of nerves named monica ( martha plimpton , all dressed up in her best cyndi lauper ) . 

among the potential guests are likeable cad kevin ( rudd ) and his best friend lucy ( love ) , busy bickering over his recent break-up , and a clumsy but seemingly charming bartender ( ben affleck ) who opens his mouth only to spew forth bad pick-up lines . 

more subplots - _many_ more - dot the big picture , but those listed above are the only ones worth noting in a positive light . 

all the other story tangents are as frazzled as a cokehead trying to solve a rubick's cube . 

ricci and gaby hoffman grate as two ronkonkoma gals ( the kind that have trouble pronouncing hard consonants ) out to have a high time in the big city . 

infamously acerbic comedienne janeane garofalo is wasted in what amounts to a several-scene cameo . 

hudson , as a pretty-in-pink klutz recently devirginized by a reprehensible ladies' man ( jay mohr ) , trips , pukes and gets smeared with dog poop . 

are we laughing yet ? 

the film boils down to a mixture of the good , the bad and the gaudy , with the latter two overtaking the former . 

game performances - especially by love , rudd and plimpton - are almost shot down by the bizarrely colorful parts and a constantly roving focus , here a combination that mostly sputters when it should crackle . 

too many sidetracks rate as uninteresting and have little payoff until a lengthy final montage where we find out many of the performers served as one night stands for each other . 

if this is "" 200 cigarettes , "" then get me 200 nicotine patches . 
"
"of the major horror sub-genres , vampire movies are easily the most adaptable . 

think about it . 

frankenstein movies haven't changed all that much because they still need that mad-scientist-in-bavarian-castle setting . 

if you made a frankenstein movie today , you'd have to have the monster be a virus or something -- and outside of michael j . fox , there aren't any actors that could play a virus convincingly . 

movies about mummies would still have to be set in egypt . 

there's not much you can do with werewolves except take them to london or paris , unless you want to have a teenage werewolf or something . 

 ( and there's that michael j . fox thing again . ) 

but you can have vampires do anything , and you can place them in any genre you want , just about . 

you can have traditional vampire movies ( bram stoker's dracula ) or have the anne rice version ( interview with the vampire ) , or play it for laughs ( vampire in brooklyn ) . 

you can put vampires in locales from sunny southern california ( the lost boys ) to squalid mexican dives ( from dusk till dawn ) to your local high school ( buffy , the vampire slayer ) . 

were it not redundant , you could have a movie about a law firm full of vampires . 

any day now , i expect we'll see a movie about a vampire third baseman who has to decide whether to play a day game in order to break the home run record . 

or , you can insert the vampire legend into a hong kong action movie -- and when you do that , you get blade . 

wesley snipes has the chow yun fat role in this movie -- the silent , expressionless hit man who destroys everything in his path . 

in this case , the everything happens to be vampires that explode into cgi shards instead of dead , bleeding corpses . 

snipes has less to say here than as the fugitive in u . s . marshals , but does a demonstrably better job here as a half-vampire wreaking vengeance on the bloodsuckers . 

blade is a silent , brooding presence , laying waste to vampires without a shred of remorse . 

he is as cold as his silver-bladed sword , as single minded as his garlic-filled bullets . 

yet , he's not without quirks : blade drives a battered muscle car and has to glean rolex watches from his vampire victims in order to stay solvent . 

like any good hong kong movie , blade is heavy on the chopsocky action . 

for some reason , blade spends a lot more time using his kung fu artistry than using the traditional anti-vampire weapons of garlic and silver . 

 ( blade dismisses a man-portable arc lamp as being too heavy , although it looks to be a more efficient tool to dispatch vampires . ) 

unfortunately , the guiding hand of john woo is absent from this film , relegating blade to the status of the replacement killers , which it most strongly resembles . 

the replacement killers is the last movie i saw that i didn't review -- mostly because it made no impression on me , and i couldn't remember anything other than noise , violence , and the intensity of fat's performance . 

blade has a little more going for it , and has the vampire myth to draw from -- but other than that , it's the same kind of movie -- exciting , with well choreographed action scenes , but with no resonance . 

with a stronger villain ( stephen dorff is ( pardon the pun ) curiously bloodless as the head vampire , leaving us to wonder what denis leary might have done with the role ) , a wittier script , and a strong supporting cast , blade might have been able to rise beyond the level of commonplace summer entertainment . 

as it is , blade is an average action movie that serves to do nothing but remind us that the summer movies just keep getting dumber and the vampire movies just keep multiplying .

"plot : a little boy born in east germany ( named hansel ) loves the american music . 

one day , he gets the opportunity to meet and marry an american g . i . , but first , he must get a sex change ( enter hedwig ) . 

once married , the two move to the states , but quickly thereafter , get a divorce . 

at that point , hedwig starts writing music and meets another confused boy , who soon turns into a star . 

that boy also turns his back on hedwig , and it isn't long before hedwig puts together his/her own band and tours the states via seafood restaurants . 

this is the story of his/her life , told via flashbacks and musical numbers . 

critique : an artsy-fartsy musical with great songs and a superb performance by john cameron mitchell , doesn't really come together as a whole , with over-the-top symbolism , incoherence and too much pretension to retain my interest all the whole way through . 

in fact , this isn't so much of a realistic , articulate , behind-the-scenes look at the rise of a rock 'n roll star , as it is an ambiguous , overly poetic and incomprehensible struggle of a man , his sexuality and his identity as a whole person on this planet . 

i guess that i was expecting the former going in . 

the film is somewhat interesting to a point , but i was personally never able to involve myself too much , as the basic symbolic and incongruent nature of the film left me feeling cold and distant . 

but it is definitely tuned to a certain type of audience . 

chances are that if you are a fan of the wall , the rocky horror picture show or even priscilla , queen of the desert , the elements tangled in this movie will likely strike your fancy ( some of the characters in this film even ask the audience to sing along at some point , and provide the lyrics of their song , on-screen ) . 

well , i personally don't care for those films , and didn't really get into the whole "" show "" atmosphere of this movie either . 

i guess i might've looked at it all too literally , but like i said earlier , i just didn't care enough about the characters to delve into the "" so the butterfly represents his freedom ? "" 

side of things . 

all i know is that the film left me with many questions unanswered and didn't make me feel any more fulfilled . 

what was hedwig's relationship with that other member of his band ( with the beard ) ? 

what happened with hedwig and tommy gnosis at the end of the movie ? 

 ( was that an actual sequence or a fantasy ? ) 

what ever happened to the lawsuit ? 

and more . . . 

all of which were part of the film and interested me somewhat . 

if the only idea behind the film was for the main character to uncover his/her sexuality , then that's one thing , but as many of the relationships and situations presented themselves in this movie , i wanted some resolution to those pieces as well . 

i didn't get it . 

the film's humor also didn't tickle my funny bone either . 

then again , i've seen many a film in these art-house theatres in which patrons are rolling down the aisles with laughter , while all i see is a tiny bit of whimsy on the screen . 

some of these films are also better enjoyed with the added "" atmosphere "" of a plant called marijuana , and i can certainly see how this movie ingrains within itself some nifty visual elements , in order to jazz up that experience . 

but being sober as i was and expecting a coherent , funny , musical with a transsexual twist , i didn't leave the theater very satisfied . 

i came out having watched an existential story of a confused man caught up in a musical lifestyle , wrapped in metaphors , dramatics and more questions than answers . 

i will , on the other hand , definitely hand some props out to the lead in this film , john cameron mitchell , who is also the man who wrote , directed and created the play on which this movie is based , and the tunes , which will likely be enjoyed by anyone who digs the sex pistols , david bowie and the whole 70s glam-rock scene . 

note : btw , it seems as though pretty much every single "" mainstream "" critic in the united states loved this movie from top to bottom ( and thought that it was really funny to boot ! ) , so you might want to take that into consideration yourself . 

but having said that , the main reason that i started this dinky website in the first place was because films like this would sometimes be uniformly applauded by the "" official "" critics , while i , a regular "" joblo "" in the audience , just wouldn't get what all the fuss was about . 

this movie is a perfect example of why i continue to write movie reviews . 

where's joblo coming from ? 

moulin rouge ( 8/10 ) - grease ( 8/10 ) - everyone says i love you ( 5/10 ) - the opposite of sex ( 8/10 ) - dancer in the dark ( 5/10 ) - o brother , where art thou ( 7/10 ) - love's labour's lost ( 8/10 )

"i've never been a huge fan of jeff bridges , but i loved him in the big lebowski . 

the part of jeff "" the dude "" lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind , and the fit is perfect . 

the dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles , a hippie slob on a bowling team with a soft spot for white russians . 

he's enjoying a leisurely soak in the tub when two thugs break into his apartment demanding to be paid for the money his wife owes . 

after much pleading he convinces them they have the wrong guy , but not before they urinate on his rug . 

the dude assumes that these "" collection agents "" were after another jeff lebowski , a famous millionaire who also lives in l . a . so he goes to meet his namesake to ask for enough money to replace his rug . 

the millionaire refuses , but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped . 

he wants the dude to act as go-between for the kidnapers . 

dude and his friend walter ( john goodman ) take on the task , and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers , millionaires , high schoolers , nihilists , artists , pornographers , thugs , and league bowlers . 

comedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres , so take my recommendation as you will : for me , the big lebowski is very funny . 

it is an incredibly successful comedy , the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films . 

not only are the two leads ( bridges and goodman ) funny separately and together , but each supporting character is a refreshing comic figure . 

all the characters end up as the butt of jokes , but the jokes are always deserved and never contrived . 

each person may be a comic caricature , but there is always a respectful self-acceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension . 

the characters are firmly established , and they never change their behavior for a quick , cheap laugh . 

it's not what they do that's funny , it's who they are , which is why the acting is so important , and so successful , in this movie . 

worth mentioning are john turturro as jesus ( that's jee-zus , not hay-soos ) , the greaser bowler who's in a lusty marriage with the game ; julianne moore as the post-post-feminist artist whose work has been described as "" vaginal ; "" steve buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked and ignored by teammates dude and walter ; and sam elliott as the rambling , long-winded narrator . 

aside from the performances , what makes all the characters funny and interesting is the astute dialogue . 

people lose trains of thought , they interrupt , they boast , they repeat themselves , they repeat their friends . . . 

they sound natural . 

taken with fargo , the coen brothers' last film , it is evidence that the brothers are observant listeners and gifted writers . 

ethan coen is not just good at directing actors , he's also good at technical directing . 

he and cinematographr roger deakins created a beautiful world on film . 

perhaps "" beautiful "" is the wrong word ; nihilists , carpet-pissers and thugs are not objects of beauty . 

but the bowling photography and a series of viking/bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed , as though the dude himself were in charge of immortalizing them on film . 

all around , the big lebowski is great , solid comedy . 

outstanding acting , writing , direction and photography all combine to make this a great comic success .

"jay and silent bob strike back can rightfully be subtitled "" kevin smith's greatest hits "" for the film is comprised of numerous references and characters from smith's earlier works including , clerks , mall rats . 

chasing amy and dogma . 

so , be advised : bone up on that cinematic quartet in order to achieve the maximum enjoyment from smith's latest outing . 

kevin smith must be a very likable person because several good sports took a ton of kidding in this feature , most notably miramax , the studio whose subsidiary , dimension films , is jay and silent bob's distributor . 

others deserving accolades include ben affleck , matt damon , directors gus van zant and wes craven and the mighty george lucas . 

this is a laugh-filled , foul-mouthed road film with jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( smith ) hitching to hollywood to sabotage miramax's production of bluntman and chronic , comic book characters based on the two jersey slackers . 

jay's convoluted reasoning is that if the film is shut down , people on the internet will stop insulting him and bob , even though it is not him and bob the people are dissing , but rather their comic book counterparts . 

no matter , the duo begin their long trek hitching rides across the country . 

but first they get some tips from a veteran hitchhiker , played by george carlin , who tells them to follow "" the book "" - the rules of the road . 

of course jay's interpretation immediately gets the duo in trouble with a friendly nun ( carrie fisher ) who offers them a ride . 

jay and silent bob contains enough laughs that the movie's weaker aspects - which include a lame subplot about a girl gang of diamond thieves as well as a buffoonish federal park ranger played by will ferrell - can be easily tolerated . 

really , how can you not laugh at a film in which our heroes are picked up by the mystery van , and jay has a pot-induced hallucination concerning velma and daphne . 

the movie's highlight , though , is near the finale . 

in hollywood , jay and silent bob sneak onto the miramax lot where they crash the set and are mistaken for extras of the latest affleck-damon picture , good will hunting 2 : hunting season . 

here we are privy to a hilarious conversation between affleck and damon in which the two put down each other's careers and film choices . 

and the laughs continue to grow . 

next up is jason ( american pie ) biggs and james ( dawson's creek ) van der beek , the actors chosen to portray bluntman and chronic . 

the pair mistake jay and silent bob for their stunt doubles . 

finally , comes a star wars homage featuring one of the stars of that legendary feature . 

this bit will leave you howling . 

smith's obvious affection for pop culture icons is evident in the way he shoots these scenes and handles his performers . 

he allows them to play it all tongue-in-cheek . 

their fun comes through the screen to the audience . 

it is too bad that this is jay and silent bob's swan song . 

the characters have grown since their supporting role debuts in clerks . 

but smith realizes that times have changed , and he doesn't want his creations to overstay their welcome . 

so smith has provided them with just the right kind of exit , saving the best for last . 

goodbye jay and silent bob . 

at least you're going out with a blast .

in 1940 , walt disney released a filmed experiment . 

fantasia was a blend of two art forms : classical music and animation . 

while it was not immediately popular with the audiences of its day , it has since become recognized as something of a classic . 

according to the program notes , it was mr . disney's intention to have fantasia be a continual work in progress . 

sixty years later , thanks to the ongoing efforts of walt's nephew , a new fantasia is being released . 

it was not only worth the waiting , it is evidence to just how far animation has come during the past half-decade . 

with seven new sequences and one old favorite , fantasia 2000 exhibits an imagination and respect for its art form that is absent from most other feature films . 

like the original , fantasia 2000 will more than likely bore the very young , although there is more narrative appeal in this newer version and the segments appear to be substantially shorter , perhaps a nod to the shorter attention span of the studio's primary audience . 

ranging from the silly to the sublime , each segment is preceded by a short , humorous introduction or interstitial by a guest celebrity host , steve martin ( bowfinger ) being the first and most effective . 

these are quickly forgotten as conductor james levine leads the chicago symphony orchestra through the musical program which , along with the images drawn by the disney team of animators , is thoughtfully and beautifully brought to a stunning synthesis . 

fantasia 2000 is being released exclusively in the giant-screened imax theaters , making for a unique viewing experience . 

there is enough variety in the program to provide something enjoyable for everyone and surely , people will exit the theaters with their own personal favorites . 

for me , that would have to be the jazz age story of four unconnected and discontented people living in nyc who , unknowingly , help each other realize their dreams . 

drawn in the style of caricaturist al hirschfeld and inspired by george gershwin's rhapsody in blue , the music and images are blended perfectly resulting in a product greater than the sum of its two parts . 

children will like the short piece set to carnival of the animals by camille saint-saens . 

here , a goofy looking flamingo irritates the rest of the flock with his yo-yo playing antics . 

they will also giggle as donald duck , playing noah's assistant , tries to load the animals into the ark to the familiar strains of pomp and circumstance by sir edward elgar . 

 ( while the depiction is not biblically accurate , it is entertaining and might be excuse enough to familiarize ourselves with the true record by reading what is written in genesis 7 . ) 

a positive note is that the studio has avoided any segment which is as perversely dark as nihgt on bald mountain upon which the original film ended . 

there are some images based upon fantasy such as the flying whales in respighi's pines of rome or images which have their roots in mythology such as the ethereal creatures which tell the story of nature's cycle of life , death , and rebirth in igor stravinsky's firebird suite . 

but the stories they tell are uplifting , containing nothing too frightening for our younger children . 

the darkest segment , spiritually speaking , actually belongs to the only holdover from the original fantasia , mickey mouse in the sorcerer's apprentice by paul dukas . 

but overall , the emotions evoked from fantasia 2000 are positive ones , being full of hope and promise . 

music has an impact which can be undeniably felt , capable of leading the listener to emotional peaks and inspirational highs simply not attainable through other mediums . 

it is no wonder that the levites , as the priestly tribe of the old testament , were also the appointed musicians . 

if fantasia 2000 is able to introduce a new audience to music which inspires and exalts , it will have done an incredible service .

"billy bob thornton , who had a sudden rise to fame with 1996's sling blade after spending years as a virtually unknown actor and writer , is becoming one of the most versatile - and most accomplished - american actors around at the moment . 

as jacob , the simple but at times very bright loser brother of bill paxton's hank , thornton gives a performance which should leave an indelible mark on all but the most hardened viewers . 

three men , hank ( paxton ) , jacob ( thornton ) and their friend lou ( brent briscoe ) stumble upon a plane wreck which , upon closer inspection , yields a rotting corpse and a bag full of money . 

jacob and lou want to pocket the cash . 

hank , the smarter - and perhaps more naive - of the three , insists on leaving the money for the authorities to find . 

eventually , they agree to keep the cash safe until the plane is found , and then split the money three ways . 

things start going wrong , though , with greed and violence weaving their ways through their plan . 

disaster is sure to strike . 

director sam raimi , of the evil dead and darkman fame , has made an excellent and thought-provoking film , worlds away from the comic horror films which made his name . 

while there are a couple of moments which might remind one of his earlier work , raimi has made an intelligent and mature departure which will hopefully be a sign of even greater films to come . 

scott b . smith's screenplay , based on his novel ( which i haven't read ) is a fine example of escalating tension . 

while it does remind one of danny boyle's shallow grave without the abundance of black humour , it keeps the drama that should really be a part of such a story on morality , or the lack thereof , found in a film with this subject matter . 

alar kivilo's cinematography reminds one of joel and ethan coen's fargo , with the bleak , snowy landscape almost becoming another character . 

danny elfman also does well with his moody , finely-written score . 

if there's a flaw in the film , it's that it goes on for just a little too long . 

just when we think that they are about to wrap things up , raimi and smith decide to let the film go on a little further . 

while this isn't really a bad thing , it did become a little frustrating at times ( this may have been due to the fact that i had consumed a large sprite beforehand ) . 

the performances are excellent , with the usually annoying paxton in fine form and bridget fonda giving a scene-stealing turn as hank's scheming wife . 

this is an excellent showcase for thornton's fine skills as an actor and a great change in direction for raimi , who could very well have a career ahead of him as an accomplished director of dramatic films . 

fingers crossed , though , that this doesn't stop him from making another evil dead sequel .

"118 minutes ; not rated ( though i suspect it would be rated pg for adult themes and language ) 

mamoru oshii is a name that probably isn't very well-known to most american audiences , but perhaps it should be . 

oshii was the director of last year's best-known japanese animated film import , _ghost in the shell_ , and is known among fans of japanese animation , or anime , for making films with a deep philosophical bent . 

one of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series . 

in its many incarnations--graphic novels ( "" manga "" ) , two different runs of made-for-video episodes ( original animation videos , or oavs for short ) , and a television series running to nearly fifty episodes--patlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan . 

set in the very near future ( though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived ) , this atypical giant robot anime features the characters , rather than the machinery , as the primary focus . 

as a whole , patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan . 

as the prologue to each episode of the television series explains , giant industrial robots , known as "" labors "" ( an interesting play on words , considering that "" robot "" is derived from the czech word for labor ) , have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century . 

with the rise of labors , however , has come a new menace--labor crime . 

this led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions , using patrol labors to fight labor crime . 

the patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division , sv2 , who , through no fault of their own , have acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness . 

sometimes utterly hilarious , sometimes almost deadly serious , the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers , and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life . 

those who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie , although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers . 

the story , as has much of patlabor before , centers around the controversial babylon project , a gigantic seawall that will , on its completion , allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay . 

this project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists , most notably the house of sea organization . 

however , the threat in this case comes not from any terrorist , but from someone who is already dead . . . 

shinohara heavy industries , the premier labor manufacturer in japan ( if not the whole world ) , has just come out with a new operating system that increases labors' movement speed and efficiency by 30% . 

this hyper operating system , hos for short , has very quickly been installed into well over 90% of the nation's labors . . . including the patrol labors of sv2 . 

since that installation , dozens of labors , including a heavily-armed military model , have begun to go on berzerk rampages for no apparent reason . . . and the only factor they all had in common was that they were all running under the new hos . 

 ( some wags have compared this to windows 95 . ) 

it's up to asuma shinohara , labor command officer with sv2 and the son of the president of shinohara heavy industries , to find the source of these problems before more labors--including sv2's own--fall victim to them , and before hos drags his father's company down with it . 

as was the case with _ghost in the shell_ , if you just want a no-brainer actionfest , this might not be the movie for you . 

_patlabor : the movie_ is more of a psychological thriller , a technological suspense drama . 

it is closer , perhaps , to a chrichton novel than to an action movie ( crichton novels that have been made _into_ action movies notwithstanding ) . 

there are long , thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as two investigators make their way through slums and derelict housing in old quarters of tokyo , similar to sequences from _ghost in the shell_ . 

this movie is fraught with symbolism--in fact a large part of it is based on christian symbolism . 

patlabor's near-future setting is , aside from the giant robots tromping around , very similar to our own present day . 

the film uses this setting to make its central point : is progress moving too fast for humans to keep up ? 

are history and culture falling by the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced with new ? 

this is a question just as applicable to today as it is to patlabor's alternate-1999 setting . 

as far as the technical aspects of the film go ( referring to the subtitled version , as that's the only one i've seen ) , the film transfer is clear , almost phenomenally so . 

the animation quality is incredible , though the character design is different from what most patlabor fans will be used to . 

the oavs and tv series were more cheerful , better-suited to humor ; the movie , however , makes everyone look a great deal less cute , and emphasizes that this is going to be , for the most part , a deadly serious storyline . 

as far as cinematography goes , there are many interesting moments in _patlabor : the movie_ . 

i don't think i can recall ever seeing a fish-eye perspective used in any other animated film ( save for _ghost in the shell_ , another oshii film ) , or indeed , in many other movies at all . 

the cinematography is well-suited to the storyline , emphasizing what it needs to , though a couple of scenes ( where characters' features are exaggerated in anger ) may seem slightly strange to western audiences . 

the audio track of _patlabor : the movie_ is in glorious hi-fi stereo , and should be used to demonstrate home theater systems--it _is_ that good . 

even without headphones , sounds from either side of the screen can be clearly heard to _come_ from that side . 

giant robot footsteps are deep and booming . 

the sometimes-understated , sometimes-blaring score is crisp and clear , and always right on the mark , enhancing the moods created by the animated scenery . 

as far as the subtitles go , i have to say that they're among the most easily-readable subtitles i've ever seen for _anything_ . 

large enough that they don't strain the eyes , but small enough not to conceal too much of the screen . 

although it does have several action sequences in it , most notably the climactic conclusion , _patlabor_ is foremost not an action movie . 

although it is a superbly-realized film , it relies in large part upon prior familiarity with some of the characters to carry the story , and that could detract from some people's enjoyment .

"we could paraphrase michelle pfieffer's character in dangerous minds and say that beyond rangoon starts with an "" a . "" 

that's fair enough . 

all movies , like all school children , should be given the benefit of the doubt . 

the chance to succeed . 

after all , we like to think that the right combination of talent and effort can do wonders . 

mountains can be moved , and good movies can be made . 

yeah right . 

children fail , as do films . 

as does director john boorman's latest . 

the success of beyond rangoon hinges on the believability of patricia arquette ( ed wood , true romance ) as the busty westerner-in-peril wandering about 1988 burma without a passport . 

though we can stomach the mild plot contrivances that get her there , it's a tougher task to overlook the actress . 

she's a lightweight . 

as the first scene ( with narration ! ) 

demonstrates , she doesn't have * nearly * enough range for the emotions that her character--a mother fleeing the memories of a murdered husband and son--is supposed to show . 

she may give a stronger performance than , say , keanu reeves in a walk in the clouds , by not by much . 

beyond rangoon is a very physically appealing film , thanks to the practiced craftsmanship of john boorman ( deliverance , excalibur , hope and glory ) . 

he keeps the narrative moving , no matter how muddy the story--or the heroine--gets . 

why he chose arquette remains a mystery , though . 

maybe he was thinking that the dramatic weight of the story would overcome any casting deficiencies . 

but even after an hour of half-stated political statements and murky mass killings , we * still * don't know enough of what's happening in this country to feel distressed for the characters or their situations . 

empty exoticism . 

the technical credits in beyond rangoon are a curious mix , combining lush jungle photography with bad blue-screen work . 

also odd is the obvious dubbing . 

done to make some of the foreign characters sound less foreign ? 

and , is it my mistake , or do the same extras keep reappearing as different soldiers ? ? 

doo doo doo doo .

"ingredients : man with amnesia who wakes up wanted for murder , dark science fiction city controlled by alien beings with mental powers . 

synopsis : what if you woke up one day , and suspected you were not on earth , and instead were part of an experiment in a giant space terrarium manipulated by intergalactic alien zookeepers ? 

in dark city john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) has this problem . 

dark city starts out like a 1940s noir amnesia detective mystery . 

poor john wakes up with amnesia in a hotel room with a dead dame in one corner . 

a mysterious phone call tells him to get the heck out of there , and soon enough john is chased all over town by a murderous army of pale people in black trench-coats , as well as by the police , and the dogged inspector bumstead ( william hurt ) . 

is john a murderer , and what can his missing memories tell him ? 

he searches through his own wallet for possible contacts and clues . 

but when the clues don't fit , it doesn't just confuse him ; it causes john to go so far as to question the whole nature of reality in the dark city . 

to john , something is fishy , and very unreal about this city . 

how come it's always dark , and nobody seems to remember what they did this morning ? 

and how come nobody seems to remember how to leave the city , or how to get to nearby shell beach ? 

every night , around midnight , john notices that the whole city enters a state of suspended animation , and at this time , creepy alien experimenters known as the 'strangers' come out and do nasty things like inject fake memories into people's heads with big hypodermic needles . 

the strangers have the ability to 'tune , ' or warp reality using telepathic powers . 

turns out , the city is not on earth at all . 

and the reason why john doesn't fall victim to the nightly suspended animation , is because he is a human mutation that possesses the same god-like reality-warping abilities as the strangers . 

even with the help of scientist dr . daniel schreber , can john take back the dark city ? 

opinion : director alex proyas ( he also directed the crow ) mentions this in the dark city press kit : in films , science fiction is always "" used to have big spaceships blow up cities . 

i think we're a little tired of that . "" 

according to director proyas , probably the most interesting thing about dark city is its layers . 

it's designed so that you can watch the film over again , and examine it from the perspective of a main character other than murdoch . 

it's a philosophical piece . 

cinematic science fiction is basically a thinly disguised shootout between the good humans and the bad aliens ( whether they be klingons , giant bugs , or proponents of the dark side of the force ) . 

but science fiction in books reaches beyond the 'shoot-em-up' level and targets the big questions , questions like who are we ? 

what is the human condition ? 

what is ethical ? 

what would a true human being do ? 

far from comic book style on the order of spawn , batman , or the mutant ninja turtles , dark city not only features the showdown between good humans and powerful aliens , but it also asks questions worthy of films such as brazil or blade runner . 

dark city is what philosophers would call an existentialist screenplay . 

a little more than 200 years ago , the world was filled with unhappy peasants - - unhappy because nearly every aspect of their lives was controlled by totalitarian , military , conformist , medieval regimes . 

the people took refuge in religion , the idea being that earthly life was a time of suffering , but after death , heaven would be available . 

meanwhile , the state used these same ideas to prop up their regimes ; the king was often head of the religion and therefore sanctioned by heaven . 

when science finally overturned religion , the medieval dictatorships came tumbling down and were replaced by democratic governments . 

but the new fear was that the power of science and experimentation would be used to create a world order as darkly totalitarian as the old . 

this is the time period when writers and philosophers such as freud , kant , kafka , nietzsche , and dostoevsky pondered what society should be , and what place the individual had in it . 

the existentialists' in particular wrote about the power of the lone individual against what may be a hostile , indifferent , or alienated universe . 

in dark city , when the last dying , defeated alien asks john murdoch why the aliens' scientific experiments on the human beings' brains failed , murdoch replies , pointing to his head , "" because the human condition isn't located in here . ""

"i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files . 

first , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie . 

the producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable . 

you have to reach for a larger audience . 

therefore , the movie is quite user-friendly . 

altough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange . 

but fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on . 

you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera . 

in any case , the answer is no . 

i am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium . 

however , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie's opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie . 

i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new . 

everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others . 

i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie . 

warning : major spoilers follow ! 

please do not read , to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird "" hummm "" sound is all about . 

you have been warned . 

the x-files is what a summer should be . 

exciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances . 

this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank . 

from start to finish , this movie does not let go of you . 

when i compare it with last summer's movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon . 

this flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes . 

in fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue . 

you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! 

the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid . 

you know , when you are affraid to put you feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? 

so yeah , the x-files is scary . 

and guess what ? 

you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster . 

do not think that the x-files is a monster movie . 

in fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total . 

no , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series . 

scully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time . 

she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much . 

no , this is mulder's time in the spotlight . 

by now , you have heard of the scene where mulder "" showers "" independence day . 

if you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let's just say that due to recent events mulder should be "" showering "" godzilla instead . 

to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there . . . who 

cares ! ? 

if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ? 

the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous . 

the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill . 

the script is spotless , every thing that happens happens for a purpose . 

if you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become clear later on but , and i cannot stress this enough , pay attention ! ! ! 

unlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects . 

miss one vital piece of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense . 

also , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies . . . don't ! 

the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation . 

there is no time to take a breather between scenes because , again unlike most summer movies ( godzilla anybody ? 

 ) the x-files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots , every scene is crucial and serves a purpose . 

who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a "" big emotional scene "" between godzilla attacks ? 

so far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i'd recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose . 

but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie , the x-files is . 

what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited ? 

cool effects ? 

it's good some . 

pulse pounding ? 

hell yes ! 

strangely enough , i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non-fans will have a good time . 

it does not provide answers to the show's many questions , the status quo remains nearly the same and , no , mulder and scully do not get together . 

rating : four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer , several jump right out of your seat thrills , many "" whoah , i never saw that one coming ! "" 

moments , four "" holy shit , where the hell did that come from "" and one heck of an ending . 

you may wonder where this movie lost half a star . 

well , i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck , the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop . 

it's pretty obvious the film's makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time , but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving .

"what is freedom ? 

how does one determine who is free ? 

in 1839 , those questions were more difficult to answer then they are now . 

yet , the mistakes of our forefathers must be examined in order to rectify current situations . 

that is , in essence , what steven spielberg's gripping drama "" amistad "" is about . 

through its various dramas , spielberg presents a case about a group of africans , who , after being seized from their home , were forced onto a ship and sent to the united states aboard "" la amistad "" . 

on their way there , the slaves , led by cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , rebelled , killing off part of the crew . 

however , the ship was still directed towards the united states , where the africans were brought to trial under murder . 

in the court , various factions claim ownership of the slaves , and therefore try to seize them away . 

the united states government , led by president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , and secretary of state secretary forsyth ( david paymer ) , try to ship the africans to spain , where an 11 year old isabella ii ( anna paquin ) wants them back . 

the two spaniards who own "" la amistad "" want the slaves for themselves . 

the american ship that found the slaves also wants them . 

in the midst of this are two abolitionists ( stellan skaarsgard and morgan freeman ) , who want the slaves to be free . 

they enlist the help of lawyer matthew mcconaughey , who tries to free them . 

through various legal proceedings , the case appears before the supreme court , where it is argued by ex-president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) . 

the film itself is a visual wonder . 

spielberg favorite janusz kaminski sets the film in a dark , somber mood when appropriate , and a visual setting when appropriate as well . 

at times , the film is very slow , and very methodical . 

however , spielberg is not at his finest here , because the courtroom scenes have a tendency to lag . 

the film is , in essence , a courtroom drama , one whose events are oversimplified . 

the characterization is also weak , displaying weaknesses in building up characters such as the lawyer baldwin ( mcconaughey ) , and especially morgan freeman's abolitionist . 

but spielberg's finest work in the film , the opening scene , a scene of cinque's family , and the brutal voyage of the slaves to america , is altogether stunning . 

it is this emotional force that carries the film . 

mcconaughey is superb as the lawyer defending the africans , hopkins is sensational as the old adams , freeman is outstanding when used ( spielberg vastly under uses his supreme talents ) , and the rest of the cast is stellar . 

the movie , however , belongs to hounsou . 

his emotional intensity is brilliant . 

spielberg manages to make even the slowest scenes sparkle with focus on hounsou , and the film's extraordinary power is simply captivating . 

the film is flawed , for most of the supporting characters are merely cardboard . 

but that doesn't matter . 

the story is a gripping one , and one of extreme importance . 

kudos to spielberg for finding it , finding the right men for the job , and letting the audience listen to the words of cinque . 

a good job all around .

"the premise of the new teen-targeted horror film `final destination' causes a recollection of a memorable `simpsons' halloween episode . 

after attempting to repair a malfunctioning toaster , lovably ignorant patriarch homer realizes he has created a portable time-machine . 

after a trek into the cretaceous period , homer observes that any minor alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events and seriously modify the present world . 

again and again , homer toys with the master plan and pays dearly for it . 

the characters of `final destination' have also tampered with the blueprint schematics of their existence - their `design' . 

someone is after them with the strict intent of correcting the mistake . 

that someone is death . 

you see , alex browning ( devon sawa ) and six others have cheated the grim reaper . . . . 

but the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve . 

for a high school excursion , alex's french class is traveling to paris by airline transport . 

alex , tense and neurotic , has a shocking premonition after boarding : he sees the plane , and every passenger on it , spontaneously explode in mid-air . 

in a panic of sheer lunacy , alex charges his way through the aisle and demands removal from the aircraft . 

after a handful of others ( including one teacher ) follow and are denied admittance back onto the plane , the unwitting ? survivors' watch in horror as the plane actually explodes in the drizzling night sky . 

the loony vision alex experiences does actually materialize . 

but death won't be cheated so easily , and one by one , the survivors of flight 180 are offed in mysteriously gruesome circumstances . 

the grisly murder count baffles the local officials and fbi . 

before i delve into the meat of the review , i'd just like to confer . . . . 

is that one helluva premise , or what ? 

`final destination' , creepy beyond rational comprehension , probably reads more like an unsettling `x-files' episode than `the simpsons' - therefore , the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan and james wong . 

on familiar turf , the task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan and wong , and the opening 20 minutes of `final destination' reflects that . 

unlike most thrillers , the set-up is crisp and cool . 

you just deeply , sincerely hope that the momentum won't unspool , leaving us with a second-string effort with nothing but cheap , derivative shocks . 

young viewers have a palpable reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration , what with `i know what you did last summer' and sequel , `idle hands' and -- a movie with a nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil -- `urban legend' . 

after the set-up , when i remained slouched apprehensively in my chair , i started to really have fun with `final destination' . 

low and behold , a teen thriller that is actually unsettling , actually suspenseful and -- yes -- actually intelligent . 

some splotty logic and a heap of characteristic genre flaws aside , this film is among the most refreshing and all-out enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cutting-edge `scream' in 1996 . 

`final destination' stimulates the nerves and offers a exhilarating retaliation strike against all the blood-spattered slasher crap we've endured throughout the past few years . 

not that the characters are that good . 

sawa is game as alex , a connect-the-dots personality that we never fully comprehend . 

in addition , the survivors are endearing geek tod ( chad e . donella ) , jocky control-freak carter ( kerr smith of `dawson's creek' ) , carter's ditzy girlfriend terry ( amanda detmer ) , the none-too-subtly named billy hitchcock ( seann william scott , supplier of lukewarm comic relief ) and a lone teacher - the emotionally delicate ms . lewton ( kristin cloke ) . 

aside from alex , the primary center of interest is intended to be ali larter ( `varsity blues' ) , playing an abstract character named clear rivers ( what were her parents thinking ? ! ? ) . 

the personality of clear is written with such a vague , nebulous definition that she resembles a walking flash-card saying `hello , i am the offbeat character designed to identify with the main character's plight ! ' 

toss a few stereotypical fbi agents ( daniel roebuck and roger guenveur smith ) and a . . . . ummm . . . 

`spiritual' mortician ( former `candyman' tony todd ) into the mix , and you have what could be another generic teenage frightfest with slicing , dicing and assorted disembowelments . 

not so . 

`final destination' has no slicing and dicing , or at least none dealt by a human killer , and the thought of death itself as the unseen stalker is unique and frightening . 

the extra dimension of disconcerting irony rejuvenates the decaying ? murderer-on-the-loose' concept , with assistance from a shrewd , intelligently paced screenplay by morgan , wong and jeffrey reddick . 

the plot twists are fun and clever without toppling into utter absurdity ( listen up , `reindeer games' ) . 

but i suppose the most satisfying aspect of `final destination' is the murder scenes . 

creative , resourceful and breathlessly inventive , the death sequences involve an unlikely string of events leading to a character's demise . 

what will trigger the accident ? 

will it be the john denver record , just put on to play `rocky mountain high' ? 

 ( yeah , sick humor ) . 

will it be the leaking toilet ? 

the falling fishing reel in the corner ? 

the murders are startling and largely unforeseen , including one surprise incident that made the audience jump out of their seats and giggle nervously for roughly a minute afterward . 

a sense of giddy unpredictability is added with this inventive approach . 

it gets sorta tasteless and cheap sometimes , but who cares ? 

it's fun . 

in that simple regard , `final destination' is my cup of tea . 

this stylishly executed thriller , although tagged with laughable circumstances and the occasional snippet of lame dialogue , is an immensely entertaining jaunt to the dark side . 

after the show , it will also have an frightening impact on you . 

when will your ? design' expire ? 

is death waiting around the corner ? 

the `final' effect is a major case of the heebie-jeebies .

"plot : a young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon , to whom he's devoted a tribute band in which he sings , gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place . 

critique : i'm a sucker for movies like this . 

a young man with a humble background and lofty dreams , works hard , devotes the time , the energy and the patience , and ultimately hits it big-time . 

in the case of this film , our boy loves a certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it ( yup , luck always finds its way into these types of equations , although generally tied very closely to hard work ) , they need a new singer . 

his entry and adaptation to the whole "" rock 'n roll "" lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch . 

although i will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love ( or past love ) of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it . 

metal was one of my first loves as a teen and even though the genre of music isn't that prominent anymore , i still check out my motley crue , twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again . 

that's not to say that you won't like this film if you don't like the music , but the music and live performances from the band , play a big part in the movie , and i for one , had a blast watching and listening to it all . 

but the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg . 

wow , hand this fella some major props , as he totally becomes this heavy metal geek/god ( incidentally , metal god was the film's original title , and a much better one if you ask me ) . 

he is this movie and i was quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through . 

he came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals and work ethic , who was willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dreams . 

aniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend ( and the romance angle between them was sweet ) , but she didn't pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes . 

i was also impressed by some of the "" real "" musicians who played in the film ( zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne , jeff pilson from dokken , stephan jenkins from third eye blind , blas elias from slaughter ) , but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members . 

it's to note that this film was based on a real-life tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer ( their original singer also admitted to being gay , as in this film ) . 

just for the record , i'm certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements , since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies , but because it's a fun , uplifting , well-paced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances . 

oh yeah , and for those who dig the "" heavier "" side of music , the soundtrack also rocks ! ! 

you see . . . dreams 

can come true . . . 

where's joblo coming from ? 

almost famous ( 8/10 ) - blow ( 8/10 ) - boogie nights ( 9/10 ) - detroit rock city ( 8/10 ) - girlfight ( 6/10 ) - goodfellas ( 10/10 )

"to paraphrase a song title from an earlier disney movie , mulan is a whole new world . 

the mouse factory's latest feature is a treasure , featuring magnificent animation , a strong story and finely drawn characters . 

mulan is the story of a fiesty , head-strong young woman who , unlike other disney heroines , isn't seeking her prince charming , 

mulan's motivations are simple ; to save her father , serve her country and find a place for herself in a world in which females have no say . 

the story of mulan takes place in ancient china at a time when the huns have invaded the nation . 

the emperor has called for a conscription , one man from each family to join the army and defend the nation . 

mulan's crippled father is called , but mulan sneaks off , steals his armor and takes his place . 

mulan is a saga of courage and self-discovery . 

yet , despite the grim backdrop of war , it is a lively tale of self-reliance and brain-over-brawn that even the smallest child can appreciate and enjoy . 

the movie utilizes a strong corps of asian-american talent as the voices for the main characters , including the wonderful ming-na wen ( the joy luck club ) as mulan , b . d . 

wong as shang , mulan's commanding officer and later love interest , pat morita as the emperor and the veteran soon-tek oh as mulan's proud , but loving father . 

also adding to the proceedings is eddie murphy as mushu the dragon , sent by mulan's ancestors to watch over and help the young woman . 

his fast , wise-cracking , hip-talking mushu may seem out of place , but it's a crowd pleasing performance , especially for the youngsters . 

the movie features only a couple of songs , fewer than most previous disney animated flicks , but mulan's are winners . 

the music by matthew wilder and lyrics by david zippel fit nicely into the plot . 

the overall score by jerry goldsmith also is a plus . 

mulan is a treat , more powerful than hercules , with more heart than the hunchback of notre dame . 

at about 85 minutes , mulan moves rapidly , and will hold the attention of youngsters from beginning to the end . 

mulan will set a new standard by which future animated efforts by disney and other studios will have to work hard to attain . 

also , it is hoped that the success of mulan , and there is no doubt that it will prove to be a popular vehicle , will spur an interest for more movies with oriential or asian-american themes so as to provide more substantial roles for the talented performers who gave their voices for this production . 

it would be nice to see them on screen as well as hear them . 

committed to lifelong learning through effective communication

"a slight romantic comedy with a feminist bent , but one with no edge to it . 

it turns out to be a conventional film filled with the usual clich ? s and stock characters of this genre . 

though it's a well-written and well-acted fluff piece , it still does not have too much to say that is surprising . 

it's made for the gentle art-house set , those who don't want something too disturbing to think about . 

it's about a critically successful writer husband , alec ( pryce ) , who is so self-absorbed that he's threatened by his department store floor-walking model wife , kate ( bouquet ) , who wants to be a writer . 

she meets his crass publisher , vanni corso ( walken ) , another self-absorbed man , and a predictable relationship occurs . 

the fireworks occur because she outgrows her husband's first impressions of her as someone who was impressed with his genius and worships at his feet . 

she now wants her own identity and her independence . 

the film looked like the usual sitcom stuff , and is plagued with the cheap set design features reserved for a tv movie . 

the film sagged in the middle of the story from the weight of its tedium , and eventually landed on its rear end with its unspectacular climax . 

it's set in london , and it opens as model kate rebuffs sexual advances by a wealthy american shopper , vanni . 

she later meets him as her hubby's new upstart publisher who seeks to have her intellectual author husband in his stable in order to give him credibility as a publisher of quality , and he quickly wins favor with her by publishing her vanity novel . 

alec who is an obnoxious grouse , someone whom it seems it would be impossible to live with , tries to do everything to stop his wife from having her book published--which only pushes her into the grasping arms of vanni . 

the publisher is proud that he's a mamma's boy who never married and is a self-made man who has earned millions . 

he has recently acquired a failing old london publishing house and plans to revitalize it , as he proudly tells kate : "" if my father could sell pizzas in harlem , i could sell culture in europe . "" 

the only thing that couldn't be sold , is this stiff story and tired plot line . 

the mystery to me , is how the lovely kate could like either man unless she was an insensitive dummy . 

she soon divorces the beleaguered alec and marries the soon-to-become-beleaguered vanni . 

when she writes a second novel , he rebuffs her the same way her first hubby did . 

it ends with the same results that happened to hubby number one , as its story of ambition and lust winds down in a whimper . 

a business affair was loosely based on the real-life literary and romantic travails of married authors barbara skelton and cyril connolly , in their celebrated 1950s love triangle . 
"
"according to the publicity material , with this movie the directors "" hope to restore good old-fashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness . "" 

hmm . 

you never know , they just might be on to something . 

what with the rise of geek chic , lounge music and seventies fashion , the ever-contrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana to claim as their own . 

but then , i doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it . 

it's cheesy all right , but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch . 

that's a shame , because , in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be a lot more . 

woody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise , roy munson . 

the movie opens in the fifties with roy's dad dishing out the reader's digest/gumpian wisdom in scoopfuls , shifting to the 70s for a hilarious spoof of saturday night fever . 

the sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray , as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken . 

it's thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good - he gives the wry , derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy . 

mccracken dupes munson into a hustling job , then abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roy's hand . 

then it's fast forward 17 years later when munson is a fat , balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand . 

he's hopeless until he meets ishmael ( randy quaid ) , an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege . 

so together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno , picking up pretty hustler claudia ( vanessa angel ) on the way . 

with the exit of bill murray , the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go , and that's . . . 

dumb and dumber . 

yes , indeed , kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour , peter and bobby farrelly , the directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle . 

so , prepare for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands , distended nipples , ridiculous hair and bull semen . 

get set for stock fish-out-of-water situations when city-boy roy puts on a beard and tries to blend in with the amish community , or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking , striptease and unchristian neighbour-socking . 

now , don't get me wrong , there's nothing wrong with cheap humour , and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody and randy . 

the trouble is that these jokes aren't bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction . 

it lurches from sports movie to amish-mocking to road-trip to sentimental melodrama , ( pausing for a broadside spoof of indecent proposal , and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack ) , never quite getting it all together . 

some gags fall flat from a lack of build-up , while there are bits and pieces in the movie that simply don't do anything . 

why the long , unfunny fight in the car park ? 

why two of these ? 

why does that guy wear mascara , or that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose in it ? 

the film is full of these half-thought-through ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer , grip or makeup artist throwing in random stuff and saying , "" wouldn't that be funny ? "" . 

well , no , actually . 

the actors don't do the movie much favours either . 

woody harrelson comes off okay , plausibly acting dumb , smart , cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it , but randy quaid is a ceaseless ham , and vanessa angel has no talent ( like schwarzenegger , she seems more convincing playing a computer-creation than a human -- take the tv series weird science . . . please 

 ) . 

even murray hams it up when he reappears in the movie's climax . 

all in all , a fairly useless attempt at comedy , and a certified no-hoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance . 

we'll have to look to a reinspired john waters , or perhaps somebody from down under ( "" strictly bowling "" , anyone ? ) for the definitive bowling comedy . 

the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video . 

 * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! 

 * * * pretty good , bring a friend . 

 * * * * amazing , potent stuff . 

 * * * * * perfection . 

see it twice .

"it seems like i'm reviewing cheeseball horror movies on a monthly basis now . 

scream revitalized a genre the studios are now intent on burying into the ground again-the serial killers in these new slasher movies have nothing on sony and miramax in the "" relentless "" department . 

i still know what you did last summer is a terrible film in many respects , but in the wake of the stupefyingly bad urban legend , it's citizen hook . 

jennifer love-hewitt reprises her role as buxom teenager julie james-who apparently escaped certain doom at the end of the last movie by . . . waking 

up . 

she lives in fear of ben willis , the vengeful fisherman-victim of a hit and run by julie and her pals . 

paranoid and beat , she accepts a free trip to the bahamas from her friend karla ( norwood ) , winner of the local radio station's 4th of july getaway giveaway . 

bikini-ready julie invites boyfriend ray ( prinze , jr . ) , who-and here's the movie's biggest mystery-turns her down , but changes his mind and plans to surprise her before take-off . 

until he gets a roadside visit from captain hell-liner himself , that is . 

unaware of this and feeling shunned , julie goes on vacation , anyway , with karla , karla's boyfriend ( pfeiffer ) , and will ( matthew settle ) , a real boy-next-door type who's sweet on julie . 

to make a long story short-i can't believe it took a paragraph to describe the set-up for this gratuitous sequel-the trip is a disaster . 

not only is it storm season , not only is the desk clerk ( the frighteners' jeffrey combs ) a jerk , not only are the few island residents and our heroic vacationers getting picked off by the resourceful willis one-by-one , but the karaoke machine isn't working properly ! 

 ( you think killing is hard ? 

try reprogramming a laserdisc so that gloria gaynor's "" i will survive "" now contains the lyric "" i still know what you did last summer ! "" ) 

all is not lost-ray is on his way to save the day , and a helpful witch doctor is saying little prayers for julie and co . 

this picture is really about breasts : two of them . 

julie , like a good horror heroine , never does up her shirt to the collar , always wears white in the rain , and keeps sexy underwear on in case of a sudden desire to tan . 

based on the hormonal charge i got out of the movie , i can't imagine what it was doing to the ten year old boy who sat next to me-he gets jennifer love-hewitt , and my generation got heather langenkamp ! 

lucky bastard . 

i didn't like i know what you did last summer and i can't say i liked this continuation any more or less . 

the pacing in both films is languid-how is it that so much time passes with neither murder nor character development ? 

i still know what you did last summer has a better sense of humour than the first one , though , and at least it explains away willis's random selection of victims . 

 ( i don't think the hotel maid or the stoner dude had the slightest idea what julie did last summer . ) 

director cannon ( judge dredd ) is a competent filmmaker but not a particularly imaginative one-if there is a part three ( what on earth would they call it ? ) , and the fun denouement suggests there will be , here's my suggestion : hire a filmmaker with flair , someone who can really energize this stillborn series-someone who won't rely on so many shock notes . 

and let that person run wild with the camera . 

 ( aside : if blandy [sic] must appear in the next one , try to keep the number of times she says "" baby "" to a minimum . 

thanks in advance . ) 
"
"frequency n . , 

the number of times a specified phenomenon occurs within a specified interval as the number of repetitions of a complete sequence of values of a periodic function per unit variation of an independent variable ? etc 

don't worry . 

when watching the thriller frequency , you won't have to know what the heck frequency means . 

the premise , although it may sound complex , is very basic on the big screen . 

a new york cop , john , ( jim caviezel ) finds a radio in his house , which allows him to communicate with his new york firefighter father , frank , ( dennis quaid ) who died thirty years ago . 

immediately john warns his father that he will die trying to stop a fire in an abandoned warehouse . 

when frank takes his advice and survives the accident he wasn't supposed to , the two eventually realize that by changing that one moment in the past , they have created a whole new future in which a serial killer murders john's mother and nine other women . 

it is now up to john and frank to use their special connection and save thirty years ago to make present time a better place . 

 ( i told you that wasn't confusing ? ) . 

overall , i was very pleased with frequency . 

it's occasional sappy moments perfectly synchronized with its suspenseful serial killer scenes . 

i usually don't buy those cheesy "" i love you dad "" segments in movies , but this one surprisingly satisfied me . 

maybe because the plot is so creative and universal that i believed that this is how most people would act when talking to a dead relative . 

frequency's creepy premise left me thinking once the film ended , what if ? 

what would i do ? 

would i help my own family or save a historical figure from being assasinated ? 

or stop some kids from shooting other kids ? 

or buy stock from yahoo ! ? 

 ( a character in the film does the latter with humorous consequences ) . 

frequency also reminded me of the fantastic back to the future . 

both share that "" change the past slightly , and you'll change the future heavily "" warning . 

the changes between the present and the past , such as different newspaper headlines or people disappearing and reappearing in photographs , are very similar . 

both are also wonderful feel-good family films that can attract to a number of generations . 

the only difference worth noting is that frequency's final scene doesn't set up a possibility for a lucrative sequel already in the making . 

there are some problems with the film though . 

first , there is a major flaw in the story towards the end that is somewhat distracting ( email me if you have seen the movie and want to know what i think it is ) . 

the plot must have confused even the filmmakers who frequently ( no pun intended ) switch from 1969 to 1999 while telling the story . 

another problem is that the supporting cast , including noah emmerich and andre braugher , are underused . 

while in the film , which is not enough , the aforementioned actors steal every scene they are in . 

frequency was a pleasant surprise for me and the audience i saw it with who cheered at the end . 

even if you know what is going to happen or if you think the preview ruined the movie for you , like it almost did for me , check this movie out . 

you may be surprised as well . 
"
"starting with the little mermaid and most recently the lion king , the walt disney company once again proved that they could not only consistently make modern day animated classics , but were particularly in touch with what the general viewing public--particularly kids-- wanted to see . 

therefore , it's with some surprise that as a big fan of the above mentioned movies i was so disappointed with pocahontas . 

despite some innovation and risk taking , the story is surprisingly straightforward and dramatized in broad strokes , as are its characters . 

a group of englishmen lead by the evil governor ratcliffe come to the new world in search of gold with no regard for the "" savages "" that live there . 

the natives look upon the english with just as much fear and distrust . 

only the love between the beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent a terrible clash . 

the ending , as it turns out , is not entirely a happy one and is one of the film's finer moments . 

the characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth . 

governor ratcliffe , for instance , is a snobbish , single-minded bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses . 

captain john smith is a blond hunk who , while "" slightly "" misguided , is good at heart . 

pocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who is practically being forced to marry a man who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time . 

she even comes complete with insignificant best friend . 

again , against tradition , talking animals aren't used , but a lusty , wizened , talking tree is . 

this is an odd compromise , but it's one of the few elements that really work . 

the animals are a delight , and what brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor and fun to a rather bland presentation . 

maybe it would have been a better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes . 

the talking tree , who seems to have a thing for john smith , is the only other character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed of the bunch . 

the music , a welcome delight in the later disney films , is mostly a let down here , with the exception of the catchy and motivational , "" colors of the wind . "" 

mel gibson , as the voice of john smith , has a solid singing voice and should have been used more . 

the opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs ; the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character . 

i was rather bored through what turned out to be a shorter than expected running time . 

even the children in the audience seemed restless . 

while there's no stopping a kid from seeing something that they want--or disney wants them to--most i believe will be disappointed . 

perhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history . 

it's all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit a movie's entertainment value , but doing so to historical facts doesn't work nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewer's minds and plot holes that are never filled . 

even the artwork , another disney strong point , varies greatly in quality , making any story problems even more obvious . 

as mentioned above , there were many questions that stayed with me while viewing the film . 

for instance , if john smith was truly such a world traveler and had so much experience with "" savages , "" why did he so quickly change his previous "" kill as many indians as i can "" attitude . 

if he was such a nice guy after all , he should have changed his ways long before this . 

or how about pocahontas' amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen white men ? 

i can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience , but simply saying that they had met a missionary years earlier would have cleared up a lot ; history was modified in the film anyway . 

as it is , i wonder if it doesn't give kids the wrong impression . 

in short , the film is too simplistic for adults and contains too much romance and not enough action or humor for the younger set . 

while disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest traditions , they end up failing on too many levels . 
"
" "" knock off "" is exactly that : a cheap knock off of an action movie . 

it's also the worst movie i have seen thus far this year . 

i figured it would be at least a couple of months before i saw the worst film of 1998 , but alas , it has already been found . 

jean-claude van damme stars as ( i think ) a designer jeans executive who discovers his half-brother has been supplying him with cheaper goods . 

rob schneider plays van damme's partner , and rochon plays . . . 

actually , i have no idea who rochon was supposed to be . 

she just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation as to why she was there . 

many things are not explained in this film , but i do know that for some bizarre reason , van damme seemed to be doing a jackie chan impression throughout the flick . 

where chan comes off as endearing in his "" normal guy "" character seen in many of his films , van damme just comes off as a wimp . 

we're never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions . 

to be more clear : i did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie , and even then , it was not made too clear . 

the film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong . 

tsui hark ( who directed van damme's last movie , the bad , but not nearly as bad as this , "" double team "" ) never lets the camera rest for a second , and that's no exaggeration . 

we are even treated to a five second shot from the point of view of van damme's foot entering a shoe . 

fabulous ! 

seriously , though , i have no problem with directors who want to play around with film conventions , as long as they don't get carried away . 

for example , look at sam raimi . 

 "" army of darkness "" , one of his best movies , features some of the most inventive camera work i have ever seen , but raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of story . 

that's a concept that tsui can't seem to grasp . 

the special effects and outrageous camera angles * rule * "" knock off "" to the point where the audience doesn't have a clue as to what's happening any more . 

another problem with the film is that it looks cheap . 

the film stock used is of such low caliber that i thought i was watching one of those chinese films shown really late at night . 

and for some inexplicable reason , everyone's voice seems to have been dubbed . 

even the stars . 

and even the special effects , seemingly the only aspect of the film the director actually cared about , are inconsistent . 

for example , there is a scene in which van damme drives a car out of a window . 

the car slams into the ground , and the left wheel is completely destroyed . 

seconds later , the car drives off at full speed . 

hey , i have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie , but a line must be drawn somewhere . 

finally , the acting . 

nobody gives a good performance in this film . 

van damme , an actor i usually like , is way off the mark playing "" everyman "" . 

and schneider , here to provide comic relief i assume , is totally unfunny and over acts his way through every scene . 

even the usually solid paul sorvino gives a terribly over-the-top performance as . . . 

once again , i have no idea who he was supposed to be . 

in case i haven't yet made it clear enough , "" knock off "" is the worst movie of van damme's career and possibly the worst movie of the decade . 

and it's not even one of those movies that's so bad it's funny . 

it's too inept to be funny . 

there are no redeeming factors in "" knock off "" and i seriously hope that every print of this film is burned to a crisp and that somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased .

"running time approximately 1hr 40mins 

reviewed by jack choo 

rating : 

the movie starts with a rather se7en-ish opening sequence , rather cool and sets the mood for things to come . 

the story propels the audience into a neo-reality ; somewhat very close to conscious reality but laced with weird tinges of blue and red . 

existenz is actually the name of a new virtual-reality game . 

supposedly , vr games are highly popular as is considered a legal-drug in this neo-reality . 

 * * * * ( leigh ) is the ultimate game creator and introduces her ultimate game-experience in the form of existenz . 

players are required to have bio-ports embedded in their spine , which plugs to a game-pod in order to enjoy the immersive experience . 

during a secretive beta-testing-cum-teaser meeting for this new game , an assassination attempt on * * * life occurs and she runs off with fellow bodyguard * * * ( law ) . 

 * * * is more of a realists than anything else , afraid that he'll lose reality if he begin to play these games but * * * requires his help to immerse together with her into existenz to check if the program is still functioning properly after the assassination attempt . 

as they soon discover , they are transported between realities within existenz uncovering more than they initially expected . 

existenz has all the cronenberg-gore that is expected of him . 

even so , this film is no-where near his cult classics such as videodrome or scanners . 

not even half as suspenseful as the commercially successful the fly . 

existenz can probably be looked upon as his 90's version of videodrome , even so , it is a poor follow-up . 

while in most of his famed films , his penchant for gore always hit the right note with theme of the film and plot . 

in existenz , the gory sequences are no more attached to spirit of the film and seem to be an act of over-indulgence than anything else . 

jennifer jason leigh and jude law , both commendable actors , looked aloof and miss-directed throughout the entire film . 

the scripting and acting barely pulls the film out of the b-grade category . 

it was obvious that cronenberg worked on a really tight-budget and it seems that he handled that pretty well in the production design and values created for this film ( the opening sequence , though , probably formed a considerable portion of the budget ! ) 

which is actually quite good . 

existenz is too predictable and cliched in these times . 

10 years ago , it would have been another classic for cronenberg . 

cronenberg fans however , ( those people who enjoy seeing friends getting queasy over mutilation on film ) should not give this film a miss as some form of appreciation can still be offered by you .

"starring kiefer sutherland ; reese witherspoon & bokeem woodbine i used to think that the conversation was the worse film i had ever seen . 

freeway is giving me second thoughts . 

freeway is a modern retelling of little red riding hood . 

only in the nineties , little red riding hood is a foul-mouthed juvenile delinquent played by reese witherspoon , and the big bad wolf is a serial killer ( keifer sutherland ) . 

to top that pathetic premise off -- reese goes to visit granny and you'll never guess who's waiting under the cover's in granny's bed . 

keifer sutherland is one of hollywoods most talented , yet underrated actors , and reese witherspoon is exceptionally talented and will most likely become a major star . 

so what are they doing in this movie ? 

after seeing the end result , undoubtedly they are both asking themselves the same question . 

you might be asking yourself why this is such a short review . 

the answer is quite simple -- i dont want to waste any more of my time writing or thinking about this movie than absolutely necessary . 

i wasted enough of my time just sitting through it . 

note to keifer : you wonder why you aren't a bigger star in hollywood ? 

because you keep making movies like this . 

note to reese : you were great in fear , what happened this time ? 

note to both : don't worry about it too much , no one saw this movie anyway . 

bottom line -- i'm still shaking my head . 

don't waste your time on this turkey . 

if you want to see a great keifer sutherland movie , go rent flatliners or young guns . 

reese witherspoon's abundant acting talents are used to their full potential in fear , a great thriller . 

do yourself a favor and rent one of these movies -- but stay as far away from freeway as you possibly can .

"life is beautiful is a rare treat : a lighthearted comedy that tackles a very serious subject without committing the sins of being disrespectful , or , even worse , humorless . 

it combines a charming romance with a dash of farce , stirs in a little poignancy , and ends up a very enjoyable movie . 

it's an italian film , but don't let that discourage you . 

subtitle-phobes will be missing a wonderful experience . 

life is beautiful opens as a sweet romantic comedy , with the clownish , but good natured guido ( roberto benigni ) arriving in a rustic italian town to work as a waiter for his uncle . 

the year is 1939 , and guido literally stumbles into the girl of his dreams , dora ( nicoletta braschi ) . 

their romance seems to be picture perfect , with only one stumbling block : she's already engaged to another man . 

can guido overcome the odds and win his girl ? 

what do you think ? 

however , five years later , things have taken a turn for the worse in italy . 

the fascists have stepped up their race initiatives , which is bad news for the jewish guido and his new son giosue ( giorgio cantarini ) , who are rounded up and shipped off to a concentration camp . 

unable to protect his boy in any other way , guido attempts to shield his young son from the horrors of the labor camp . 

he pretends that everything is all an elaborate game , with points awarded for such tasks as hiding , being brave and being very very quiet . 

as you can tell from the description , life is beautiful has two very different tones , but manages to excel at both of them . 

as a romantic comedy , it is sweet and funny . 

as a bittersweet tale of hope amid despair , it is touching . 

roberto benigni's work here has been compared with some of the best of chaplin's , and it is easy to see why . 

he is able to run the gamut of comic expression , from slapstick to farce , with a warm-hearted feeling that celebrates his downtrodden hero's "" triumph of the underdog "" spirit . 

life is beautiful treads a thin line when it turns its attentions to the holocaust . 

however , it is able to successfully navigate the minefield , without demeaning the gravity of the horrors involved , nor without losing its humorous edge that allows you to smile through the tears . 

with life is beautiful , benigni has created a triumphant , but bittersweet comedy . 

it's quite simply one of the most enjoyable times i've had at the movies this year .

"robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible , god-given gifts , but are able to act like ordinary people . 

in "" the natural "" ( 1984 ) , he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs , the baseball player who was destined to be "" the best there ever was , "" but still acted like a humble farm boy . 

in "" butch cassidy and the sundance kid "" ( 1969 ) , he was the most dangerous shot in the west , yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good-looking charmer . 

even in "" indecent proposal "" ( 1993 ) , where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love , redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency , especially when reciting a tale of lost love . 

in his latest film , "" the horse whisperer , "" based on the best-selling novel by nicholas evans , redford again plays such a character . 

redford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie - i suppose the character of tom booker , a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses , was just too good to pass up . 

despite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses ( a magazine article coins the phrase "" horse whisperer "" to describe his uncanny talent ) , booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life . 

booker's talents are taxed into service by annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) , a new york magazine editor whose daughter , grace ( scarlett johansson ) , was recently in a horrible accident . 

the accident , which is filmed with gut-wrenching horror , happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses - an eighteen-wheeler kills grace's friend , severely wounds and traumatizes grace's horse , pilgrim , and causes grace to lose part of her right leg . 

annie believes that if pilgrim can be healed , grace will be healed as well , which leads her to booker . 

at first , she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse , but that doesn't work . 

instead , she packs up grace and pilgrim , leaves her husband , robert ( sam neill ) behind , and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother , frank ( chris cooper ) , and his sister-in-law , diane ( dianne wiest ) . 

in many ways , the film is like a journey , both literally and symbolically . 

the move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal , and it's hard not to see annie and grace's leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs . country . 

in "" the horse whisperer , "" country is clearly the victor . 

the city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness , and it is not until the characters arrive in the wide-open spaces of montana that grace's anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate , annie's controlling nature begins to relax , and pilgrim once again learns to trust people . 

redford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed "" a river runs through it "" six years ago . 

in many ways , "" the horse whisperer "" comes from the same poetic vein as "" river , "" and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera-time on the grass and mountains . 

but then , that would ruin the magic . 

much of the film's photography is truly elegant , and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land . 

to further emphasize this , redford and cinematographer robert richardson ( "" natural born killers , "" "" platoon "" ) cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film - which takes place in new york - with mostly cold , harsh bluish filters and a more squarish 1 . 85 : 1 aspect ratio ; when the action shifts to montana , richardson switches to soft-focus and natural lighting , and the screen widens to a 2 . 35 : 1 aspect ratio . 

in terms of the story itself , "" the horse whisperer "" gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean's "" a brief encounter "" ( 1945 ) and clint eastwood's 1995 adaptation of robert james waller's "" the bridges of madison county "" ( richard lagravenese , co-screenwriter here also adapted "" bridges "" ) . 

although "" the horse whisperer "" has a strong romantic sensibility , i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story . 

it seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who's being left behind for this brief , heart-sweeping affair , but there rarely is . 

in "" the horse whisperer , "" the thankless role of being the fuddy-duddy husband falls to sam neill . 

he plays the character as a decent , hard-working man who is a good husband and father ; his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him . 

he is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away , but simply because he happens to be a normal , fairly uninspiring man . 

there is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character . 

it shows booker and robert going into a horse pen - booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all , while robert looks somewhat frumpy and out-of-place in a baseball cap . 

as they enter the pen , booker assuredly swings over the fence , while robert hesitates , then opens the gate and , in a goofy moment , forgets to close it behind him . 

it's a small scene , but it clearly demonstrates the movie's thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness . 

after all , booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it . 

the best scenes in "" the horse whisperer "" tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie , but rather the healing process of grace and her horse . 

although booker's horse-training methods are mythical and unrealistic , the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing . 

these are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace , some of which are humorous , and all of which are tender and true . 

at some point , i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more . 

nevertheless , redford is obviously a romantic at heart , and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film . 

there are no dramatic sex scenes , but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slow-dancing , always moving ever closer together , that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together . 

although the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character , there are enough moments like that which make "" the horse whisperer "" worth the price of admission .

"i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year , when matthew perry had just signed on . 

i'm big fan of perry's subtle sense of humor , and in addition , i think chris farley's on-edge , extreme acting was a riot . 

so naturally , when the trailer for "" almost heroes "" hit theaters , i almost jumped up and down . 

a soda in hand , the lights dimming , i was ready to be blown away by farley's final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perry's big breakthrough . 

i was ready to be just amazed ; for this to be among farley's best , in spite of david spade's absence . 

i was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran . 

sadly , none of this came to pass . 

the humor is spotty at best , with good moments and laughable one-liners few and far between . 

perry and farley have no chemistry ; the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade , for it's his type of humor , and not at all what perry is associated with . 

and the movie tries to be smart , a subject best left alone when it's a farley flick . 

the movie is a major dissapointment , with only a few scenes worth a first look , let alone a second . 

perry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie , and not surprisingly ; the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley . 

and farley's classic humor is widespread , too . 

almost heroes almost works , but misses the wagon-train by quite a longshot . 

guys , let's leave the exploring to lewis and clark , huh ? 

stick to "" tommy boy "" , and we'll all be "" friends "" .

"long time buddies and neil diamond tribute band members wayne ( steve zahn , "" happy , texas "" ) and j . d .

they're doubly troubled when the return of darren's 'one and only love' sandy perkins ( amanda detmer , "" final destination "" ) returns to their home town but doesn't cause a ripple in darren's devotion to judith . 

there's only one thing wayne and j . d . can think of doing - they kidnap judith and fake her death in "" saving silverman . "" 

written by hank nelken and greg depaul after seeing a friend engaged to the wrong woman , "" saving silverman "" is directed by 'hit comedy director' dennis dugan of such films as "" big daddy , "" "" brain donors "" and "" problem child . "" 

it's a dismal , third-rate farrelly brothers rip off that attempts to milk humor from such inspired bits of whimsy as having darren's love interest come from a family of circus freaks and be about to become a nun . 

gross out gags include a visualization of darren getting butt cheek implants . 

 "" saving silverman "" is almost saved by stars zahn and black . 

these two are so comically talented they can take bad material and still deliver the goods . 

they're in "" animal house "" mode while the rest of the film trawls along and comes up empty .

"call it touched by a demon . 

gregory hoblit's fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual , horrific twist . 

if marketed properly , this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim , dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven . 

in fact , there's even a little twin peaks to be found here , albeit with the lion's share of the weirdness distilled out . 

 ( remember bob ? ) 

the biggest failing of fallen is that , although it's consistently interesting , it's not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope . 

a serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia , but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) , the noblest man on the police force , has brought him to justice . 

now , during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber , the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes , "" what goes around really goes around . "" 

shortly thereafter , he begins to sing "" time is on my side "" as he's taken on his last walk . 

minutes later , the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead . 

but for hobbes , the nightmare is just beginning , because reese wasn't a normal psychopath ? he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel . 

and , with reese's death , azazel is free to hop from body to body , murdering and wreaking havoc at will . 

only hobbes and a pretty , female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what they're up against . 

the rest of the cops , including hobbes' partner , jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini ) , a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland ) , don't have a clue , and , as a result , they are in mortal danger . 

as depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel , philadelphia is a dark , dreary place ? a gothic city rather than a modern one . 

no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown . 

the most famous landmark to appear isn't the liberty bell or independence hall ; it's geno's steaks . 

shadows and night scenes abound . 

the days are cloudy and unpromising . 

this is the kind of setting where it's easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men . 

fallen's plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized . 

somehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise . 

but the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check . 

nevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks . 

the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual . 

of the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance . 

john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick . 

sadly , however , these two are the only ones who excel . 

everyone else , including denzel washington , is boring . 

washington's flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film . 

it's not that he's bad per se , but he's not very interesting . 

there's no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character , and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes . 

as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop , and as his life-or-death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate , i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was . 

washington's subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency . 

however , at least washington was believable , which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler's list ) and donald sutherland . 

to be fair , the flaws in their characters aren't all acting-related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well-written . 

that said , however , there's nothing inspired about either davidtz's or sutherland's work . 

both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts , as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual . 

narratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses . 

although the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game-like structure , it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters . 

at times , this is actually helpful , and it has a use beyond the obvious , but there are occasions when ponderous lines like "" i like the night ? sometimes you come face to face with yourself "" become a little hard to swallow . 

in addition , fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland , generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel . 

however , despite the negatives , i'm still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending , which i loved . 

the final scenes are startling , audacious , and unexpected . 

it's not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did . 

at a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes , fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself . 

this is not a great motion picture , but , considering how bad most january releases are , it's a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours . 

and , whatever you do , don't walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll .

"when _star wars_ came out some twenty years ago , the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image . 

when the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars , we see constellations , meteor showers , and cool space-ships . 

when han solo goes light speed , the stars change to bright lines , going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point . 

cool . 

_october sky_ offers a much simpler image--that of a single white dot , traveling horizontally across the night sky . 

was it really only forty years ago , when sputnik was launched , and that before then , no satellites ever existed ? 

have we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a then-technological achievement , even though it was from the russians ? 

it sounds hokey , but when that scene occurs near the beginning of _october sky_ , i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam , played by jake gyllenhaal . 

determined to make a dent in the space race , he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that could fly like the best of them . 

it is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket . 

when lovely teacher miss riley ( played by laura dern ) , suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair , we know exactly who is going to win . 

but the joy in a film like this is in the little details . 

for example , homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class . 

if he has any strengths whatsoever , it is an undeterring vision , and a good organizer . 

it means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school , who knows more about rocket science than he does . 

it means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property ( that is , the entire coal-mining town ) , he must walk eight miles one way , just to set up the rockets , which will fail , fail , fail , and fail again . 

homer+s dad is played by chris cooper , a favorite actor of mine since _lone star_ . 

here he plays the antithesis of the character he played in _matewan_ : instead of organizing union rallies , he is the head of the coal-miners , who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions . 

this is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year : note how multi-dimensional his character is . 

he is his son+s last nemesis , as one who most likely interferes with his son+s dreams . 

but he truly loves his son , and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how . 

through coal-mining . 

because of his character , we can see how far we+ve come . 

the revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us . 

we don+t understand that there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise a family . 

the paradigm was shifting under the father+s feet , and he knew of no other life . 

so _october sky_ , far from being merely a feel-good inspirational film , offers much food for thought . 

and this is the best type of inspirational film ; the one that you take something with you . 

btw , the final image of the film is just as simple , is as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontal-moving white dot against the night-sky background . 

another commonplace image , to be sure , but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago .

"susan granger's review of "" osmosis jones "" ( warner bros . ) 

if the farrelly brothers taught anatomy & physiology in school , no one would cut ever class . 

this hip , live action/animation story begins as a monkey snatches a hard-boiled egg from frank , a zookeeper ( bill murray ) , who grabs it back , drops it , then gobbles up the contaminated morsel , explaining , "" if it hits and ground and you pick it up within 10 seconds , you can eat it . "" 

like "" fantastic voyage "" ( 1966 ) , the pseudo-science animation then takes over when his body's immune system contacts traffic control as an ingested virus hits the digestive system : "" be on the alert for illegal organisms ! "" 

eager to right "" a stomach evacuation mistake "" he once made , a cocky , clever , courageous white blood cell ( chris rock ) declares , "" this is a crime scene ! "" 

and teams up with a conscientious "" phi beta capsule "" 12-hour cold remedy called drixenol ( david hyde pierce ) to chase down and destroy the deadly "" red death "" virus ( laurence fishburne ) that's determined to take frank down in 48 hours , beating ebola and e . coli to a medical record . 

watch out for mucus mudslides , chaos in cerebellum hall and the detritus from booger dam ( runny nose ) , along with comic turns from molly shannon and chris elliot , plus the voices of william shatner and brandy norwood . 

peter and bobby farrelly , along with writer mark hyman and animation directors piet kroon and tom sito , have turned their penchant for gross-out comedy , encompassing flatulence , festering sores and "" popping a pimple without a permit , "" into a funny , farrelly-funny family film . 

on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" osmosis jones "" is a wildly imaginative , original , explosive 7 . 

and perhaps , as they're laughing , kids will learn where to find their uvula , along with nuggets about nutrition and hygiene .

"the best thing about , "" lake placid "" is that it's only 80 minutes long and when it's over you're glad that you didn't waste more than an hour and a half of your time . 

it's nothing more than a bad rip-off of , "" jaws "" ( and i think that's being kind . ) 

it was written by david e . kelly ( "" ally mcbeal "" ) as a horror-comedy but fails at both , miserably . 

i was never scared and i think that i only laughed once . 

the crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in , "" anaconda . "" 

the plot begins when a man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile in black lake in maine . 

that brings the local sheriff ( brendan gleeson ) and a fish-and-game warden ( bill pulman ) to investigate . 

also , a paleontologist ( bridget fonda ) from new york is sent to look at a tooth and an eccentric millionaire/crocodile lover ( oliver platt ) flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast . 

soon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it . 

there's also an eccentric old lady ( betty white ) who lives by the lake and has a few secrets . 

as i mentioned before kelley and director steve minor ( h20 ) don't go for a serious approach towards the material but they also don't have anything sly or satirical or witty to say either . 

the betty white character is completely unfunny and none of the other characters are really that interesting , they're all basically idiots . 

if they had any brains the croc wouldn't have been that much of a challenge to catch and they wouldn't have put themselves in half of the situations that they did . 

but then again , if they were smart there wouldn't be a movie . 

basically , "" lake placid "" is best undiscovered .

">from writer and director darren stein comes jawbreaker , the poorly told tale of what can happen when an innocent birthday prank goes wrong . 

at reagan high , four girls are sitting on top of the world . 

courtney shane , played by rose mcgowan , holds the title of meanest , most disrespectful soul in the school . 

everyone hates her , but everyone envies her due to her popularity . 

courtney is the "" leader "" of her clique , which also includes julie , played by rebecca gayheart , liz purr , played by charlotte roldan , and marcie , played by julie benz are the other three in the group . 

it is liz's seventeenth birthday , and julie , courtney , and marcie concur that they will play a seemingly innocent prank on her , but the prank results in the death of liz . 

just like stupid teens in any teen directed film such as this one , the foursome decide to cover up the death to make it look like a murder committed by someone else . 

and also just like in other teen directed movies , one of the four don't agree with hiding it , this time that character being julie . 

and finally , just like in other teen movies , there is a witness outside the group trying to hide the truth . 

this time that character being fern mayo ( judy greer ) , who is subject to many cracks from courtney's group , as well as the entire school . 

>from here , jawbreaker turns into a predictable tale of revenge , bad morals , and at least trying to do the right thing . 

not only is the script weak , on a whole the acting is horrid thanks to a large amount of the main cast . 

judy greer is undeniably awful as her one dimensional , annoying character , as she overacts every line she has . 

also on the bad side of acting is julie benz , almost falling to the annoying factor that greer delivers . 

on the positive side of acting , rose mcgowan performs well here , but doesn't match her wickedly clever performance as "" tatum "" , in 1996's scream . 

mcgowan's role is annoying , but this only adds to the film . 

she is wickedly mean , and even though she a well-written character , you downright hate her . 

faring even better than mcgowan is rebecca gayheart , who is always exceptionally believable as her roles . 

when the script feeds her a one or two dimensional character , she turns it into three , always putting strong emotion and power into her roles . 

gayheart isn't given as much to do here as she was in 1998's urban legend , but you can still get a strong taste of her acting skills in jawbreaker . 

jawbreaker drifts and mianders different sub plots throughout , hardly throwing anything for the viewer to get absorbed in . 

we get way off of the topic of the jawbreaker incident , and get into things that don't have anything to do with the actual film . 

the beginning and ending are strong , it's just the middle that needs a lot of help . 

during the body of the movie , it is undeniably repetitive , never progressing towards a conclusion . 

nothing to grab the viewer's interest is around , and the same , extremely annoying song plays over and over again . 

jawbreaker tries to get off on the same time of humor used in the 1995 film clueless , but falls flat . 

the few gags that actually work die off quickly and die off with a bang . 

all in all , a horrible disappointment . 

the bottom line : the tagline reads , "" even the sweetest candies are sour as death inside . "" 

yes , that is too true . 

no matter how good this film may have looked , it fails to deliver . 
"
"it seemed like the perfect concept . 

what better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ? 

it's exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh . 

jim carrey's signed on too ? 

even better . 

the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as "" schizophrenia , "" and so forth . 

such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers' fire , proving that some people just couldn't take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy . 

yes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn't funny . 

it's not for lack of trying . 

the farrellys utilize in "" me , myself & irene "" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them . 

this , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult . 

soon enough , charlie's repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster . 

this guy isn't above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he's been insulted , or holding a little girl's head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street . 

then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks . 

some have suggested that this isn't a problem , because the farrelly brothers' brand of humor doesn't require plot to work . 

they're wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys' last effort , 1996's "" there's something about mary . "" 

 ( 1999's "" outside providence "" was technically an earlier project . ) 

the brothers' earlier film wasn't funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected . 

in "" mary , "" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they'd have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion . 

 "" me , myself & irene , "" by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at "" mary "" and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work . 

having been produced by the same guys who made "" mary , "" "" irene "" seems like an even bigger disappointment . 

the brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes . 

but they haven't come up with a way to make any of it fresh ; most of "" me , myself & irene "" comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy . 

the plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger ) , who's in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that's entirely predictable from the get-go . 

 ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? 

yeah , me too . ) 

the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven't already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be . 

compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it's no longer funny , merely gross . 

the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry . 

take , for example , the subplot involving charlie's three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) . 

the incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face . 

but by the end of the film , they're still doing the same schitck ; it hasn't been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn't been dropped either . 

that's too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through . 

 "" me , myself & irene "" reeks of wasted opportunities . 

there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie's new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank's actions . 

this doesn't really happen ; nearly every supporting character learns about charlie's condition early on , so they don't have any opportunity to be surprised by it . 

the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , "" whitey "" ) , but the script doesn't go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax . 

jim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he's left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in "" all of me . "" 

it's a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny . 

carrey doesn't pull any stunts we don't expect him to pull , and the farrellys' script doesn't give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren't set up in any meaningful way . 

perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better . 

zellweger's irene is not a strong female lead ; mary in "" mary "" may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed . 

irene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she's ditzy , clever , or neither . 

as such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only "" sane "" person in the film . 

chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this . 

he , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected . 

after viewing the shapeless mess that "" me , myself & irene "" eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves . 

maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked . 

but i don't believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style . 

if the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they'll rebound just fine . 

even after that happens , though , i'll still consider "" me , myself & irene "" to be a high-caliber misfire .

"near the end of 1996 , analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king . 

the following year , 1997 , saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom : twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia . 

at best , that's all it was -- a sleeper hit , designed to surprise but not shake the industry . 

in 1998 , however , things have been decidedly different . 

there have been a number of pushes on disney's death grip on the market , and fifty-one weeks into '98 , a new champion has emerged . 

dreamworks' the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed . 

the other two contenders , warner brothers' quest for camelot and disney's own annual entry , mulan , lacked inspiration and drive respectively . 

although camelot was borderline-abysmal , and can't really be considered a shot at the title , mulan had the makings of winner . 

unfortunately , it was saturated with traditional , disney-cute animation , and lost points against the rapidly-changing face of the competition . 

in making the prince of egypt , dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product . 

the animation is flawless , and , aside from a bug's life , is the best-looking movie to date . 

the animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects , and the 2d/3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with . 

the key to success , however , was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot . 

namely , some of the most important action sequences ( like the parting of the red sea ) were done almost entirely in 3d . 

dreamworks is the first studio to prove that they've got the stuff of success , and that they're capable of challenging disney . 

the story is also well-written , and the characters voiced with talent . 

for the most part , the plot follows its source material -- the book of exodus -- although only in the most general sense . 

the writers took a few creative liberties , and most do not damage the story in any way . 

in fact , the shakespearean relationship between moses ( val kilmer ) and the pharaoh rameses ( ralph fiennes ) makes the story more interesting if anything . 

moses , a hebrew , is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile ; he floats into the pharaoh seti ( patrick stewart ) 's palace and is taken in by the royal family . 

moses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert , where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves . 

by this time , rameses is now pharaoh , and the two brothers , now on opposite sides of the line , face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention . 

the cast of voices is most impressive , and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock , jeff goldblum , danny glover , and steve martin . 

the script does not have a lot of one-liners in it , and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams , but overall the story is exciting and interesting . 

it's decidedly for an older crowd , and the tykes who haven't had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost . 

but for those who make the bid , the prince of egypt can be a great watch .

review by : geoff berkshire 

jawbreaker is the very definition of a "" rip-off . "" 

this uninspired teen comedy takes equal parts carrie ( 1976 ) , heathers ( 1989 ) and clueless ( 1995 ) and mixes in all the necessary teen movie clich ? s . 

along the way writer/director darren stein forgets to give the film a life of its own . 

the film opens with a voice over from geeky fern mayo ( judy greer ) about the four most popular girls at reagan high : courtney shayne ( rose mcgowan ) who can basically be summed up as satan in heels , julie freeman ( rebecca gayheart ) a good girl with the face of a supermodel , marcie fox ( julie benz ) a dim-witted blonde who demands that people call her "" foxy "" , and liz purr ( charlotte roldan ) an angel in disguise . 

liz is everyone's favorite because she's both beautiful and kind . 

liz is about to turn 17 and , as a prank , courtney convinces the other girls to help her in kidnapping liz on her birthday morning . 

in order to keep liz from making any noise courtney stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth before they gag her . 

they then stuff liz in the trunk of courtney's car but when they open it later , polaroid camera waiting to capture the moment , their lives will never be the same : poor liz has swallowed the jawbreaker and choked to death with it lodged in her throat ( the audience is treated to a few too many graphic looks at liz's dead body ) . 

courtney , thinking fast , decides to pass the death off as a rape/murder and marcie and a reluctant julie assist her . 

things get complicated when fern discovers what the three girls are up to . 

in order to keep her quiet courtney comes up with another plan and transforms geeky fern into "" vylette "" , hoping that she will also help to replace liz in the minds of the devastated students . 

up until about this point the film is effective enough . 

however , an investigation begins into liz's death and the film becomes excessively dull . 

the recently rediscovered talents of pam grier are thoroughly wasted in the role of detective vera cruz and the film is downright insipid in its treatment of both the characters and the audience during this long middle stretch . 

courtney's plan to frame a sleazy guy ( marilyn manson , in a brief cameo ) is never believable for a second . 

meanwhile , the audience is stuck watching a string of random events which fail to develop the characters or add anything of interest to the plot . 

julie leaves the group and begins a lame romance with aspiring actor zack ( chad christ ) . 

he apparently gives her the courage to turn on courtney but the way things develop only make julie look stupid . 

fern's rise to popularity is equally lame . 

we do get the best scene in the film ( the only one with a spark of originality ) during this section . 

it's a smart and subversive bit where courtney gets the high school's resident jock stud dane ( ethan erickson ) to demonstrate , using a popsicle , exactly what he would like for her to do to him . 

it at least provides us with a look at courtney's personality but the way the scene finishes doesn't make any sense . 

stein is very conscious of the teen movie tradition he is working in and not only freely borrows major plot elements but also includes direct acknowledgment of this with some stunt casting . 

william katt and p . j . soles ( students in carrie ) are liz's distraught parents , jeff conaway ( from grease ( 1978 ) ) is julie's creepy single dad and carol kane ( the frightened babysitter in when a stranger calls ( 1979 ) ) camps it up as principal miss sherman . 

at times jawbreaker feels simply like teen cinema's greatest hits but the audience is cheated with watered down interpretations of the best this genre has to offer . 

the only notable aspect of jawbreaker is the incredibly stylish look . 

the costume design by vickie brinkford and the production design by jerry fleming are both bright and vivid . 

they were apparently instructed to work from the color palette of a jawbreaker and the screen is always splashed with bits of vibrant color . 

director of photography amy vicent , who beautifully lensed eve's bayou ( 1997 ) , does a remarkable job here as well . 

shot composition and camera movement is consistently impressive . 

performances are mostly sub-par with mcgowan providing only a few good moments ( compared with her excellent work in the doom generation ( 1995 ) and scream ( 1996 ) ) and gayheart making the biggest impression due to the sweet nature of her character and her obvious beauty . 

none of the actors look as if they have set foot inside a high school within the last five years with the exception of actress/singer tatyana ali , who has a small role as a cheerleader . 

the male cast all resemble male models and are credited with names like "" auto stud , "" "" college stud , "" and "" high school stud #2 . "" 

the soundtrack is decent and imperial teen's catchy "" yoo hoo "" makes a bigger impression than any other aspect of the film . 
"
"everyone's heard about this movie , and more specifically , * the * scene . 

everyone's heard the famous barnyard animal quote squealed ( no pun intended ) over and over . 

and everyone's got to admit that they will never travel down a river again without thinking of deliverance . 

good ! 

that's what you're supposed to do ! 

oh , if you are one of the ones who hasn't seen this yet , or you ( somehow ) haven't heard about what happens , here's your spoiler warning . 

deliverance was a real shocker for it's time ( 1972 ) . 

major advances were being made in films , and deliverance made its own advances when it introduced a new horror into the film industry . 

when it was first released , it literally shocked the audiences . 

it was something that , for the most part , had really never been seen on the big screen before ( among wide-release films with an r rating ) . 

but by today's film standards and in today's world , such scenes as the one in deliverance can be reproduced in a way that isn't as shocking , although they can be even more graphic ( e . g . 

pulp fiction ) . 

pulp fiction did it in a way , and expanded on it in a way , that it could even be interpreted as funny . 

but in 1972 , deliverance was no laughing matter . 

the story centers around a group of four atlanta men who decide to take a rafting trip down a backwoods river in georgia while the river is still there and in its glory . 

the initial leader of the group is lewis ( burt reynolds in his prime ) , a real outdoorsman and more of a daniel boone-type then any of the others . 

joining him are ed ( jon voight ) , bobby ( ned beatty ) , and drew ( ronny cox ) . 

the group's first objective is to find someone ( s ) to drive their cars down the river to the point where they will end their trip . 

they make arrangements with a few mountain men , who accept $40 . 00 for the task . 

drew also has the famous "" dueling banjos "" competition with a local who is , let us say , genetically challenged . 

the men then set off down the river , with lewis , also the master at canoeing , leading the way . 

everything seems to be going fine , until the two canoes split up , leaving the unexperienced ed and bobby alone . 

they encounter two hillbillies , armed with a shotgun , who captured them . 

ed is tied to a tree while bobby is sodomized by one of the men . 

ed nearly receives the same cruelty , but lewis arrives just in time to fire an arrow through the rapist's back . 

the other hillbilly gets away , and the men have to decide what to do with the dead body . 

disposing of dead bodies is done rather frequent throughout this film . 

while attempting to make a quick "" paddle for it "" , both canoes tip over . 

drew , who was without a life jacket , was possibly shot and cannot be found . 

lewis suffered a rather nasty compound fracture during the incident and is in serious condition . 

this leaves ed and bobby . 

ed decides to go out and look for the remaining hillbilly , alone , with the bow and arrow . 

the question arises if he will be able to handle himself , as he horribly botched a first shot attempt at a deer , to which his comment "" i wonder how anyone could kill a living thing "" will have more meaning in the future . 

deliverance is definitely a wild ride ( oops , i'm doing it again ) . 

it is extremely tense at some points and very dramatic . 

it's definitely one of those "" must see "" movies and should be considered one of the classics of its decade . 
"
"there are scenes in "" the big hit "" that are so awful , they simply defy description . 

the movie is infected with the same kind of blunderheaded idiocy and misplaced confidence that made "" last action hero "" ( 1993 ) such a chore to sit through . 

presumably , "" the big hit "" is an action-comedy , a difficult but not impossible genre to pull off . 

movies of this sort require a fine balance and careful tone , and the comedy is usually meant to work as catharsis for the violence . 

 "" lethal weapon 2 "" ( 1989 ) is a perfect example of an action thriller that was also very , very funny . 

unfortunately , in "" the big hit , "" it seems that comedy is the main motive , and the violence is only intended to punctuate the laughs . 

unfortunately , there are no laughs . 

the movie resembles some of the goofy , throwaway ridiculousness of early jackie chan films , but it doesn't benefit from chan's incredible stunts and goofy , charismatic presence . 

instead , we are left with a lot of digital effects and mark wahlberg , who must have considered himself invincible after his critically-acclaimed performance in last year's "" boogie nights . "" 

however , if he wants to maintain a decent career , he had better start selecting his projects more carefully - movies like this are a sure-fire recipe for a long career in the straight-to-video market . 

wahlberg plays melvin smiley , an amiable guy who also happens to be a professional hitman ( see "" grosse pointe blank "" for the same character , much better developed ) . 

the movie wants us to think , "" gee how clever and ironic - a guy who can kill without any moral implications , and yet he can't stand for anyone not to like him . "" 

the fact is , melvin is so desperate to keep people from not liking him , that he puts up with both an obnoxious fiancee ( christina applegate , with a horrendous new york accent ) and an abusive girlfriend ( lela rochon ) who is only using him for his money . 

his constant bending over backwards to please people makes him a complete patsy at best , and a thoroughly unbelievable character at worst . 

melvin is employed exclusively by a crime boss named paris ( avery brooks ) as part of a team of hitmen , which also includes cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) and crunch ( bokeem woodbine ) . 

one day , melvin agrees to do some moonlighting with cisco by kidnapping the teenage daughter of a rich japanese mogul named jiro nishi ( sab shimono ) for a million dollar ransom . 

however , not only has jiro nishi lost all his money producing a big hollywood movie ( inside joke , get it ? ) , but his kidnapped daughter , keiko ( china chow ) , also happens to be paris' goddaughter . 

so , when paris finds out she's been kidnapped , he takes it personally and becomes determined to find out who did it . 

not knowing the cisco is actually behind the whole scheme , paris puts him in charge of rooting out the kidnapper . 

of course cisco blames the whole thing on poor , innocent melvin . 

along the way , there are several obligatory gunfights , explosions , and car chases , plus a literal cliffhanger inspired by "" jurassic park , "" and a completely unconvincing romance between melvin and keiko ( who looks like she's barely pushing fifteen ) . 

what the movie passes off as humor resorts to thoroughly unfunny jokes about overweight jewish mothers , hara-kiri , drinking problems , leaking body bags , and a running gag about how crunch has recently discovered the pleasures of masturbation , and now spends all his time doing hand exercises . 

not to mention the pimply video store clerk who is always calling melvin and screeching about how he needs to return his copy of "" king kong lives , "" which is two weeks overdue . 

this mess of a movie was helmed by che-kirk wong , the latest hong kong director imported by john woo ( "" face/off "" ) , who also served as executive producer . 

woo needs to stop acting as a conduit for other directors , and start making more of his own films . 

wong , who directed such films as "" rock'n'roll cop "" back in hong kong , is completely tone deaf when it comes to comedy . 

maybe jokes about vexatious video clerks and vomiting on other people are funny across the ocean , but they're not here , at least in the manner wong handles them . 

many of the problems can be traced back to the script , which was penned by obvious freshman writer ben ramsey . 

in addition to his vague characterizations and uninspired action sequences , ramsey's script assaults the audience with his attempts to copy the vulgar , poetic rhythms of tarantino or mamet-style dialogue . 

what he comes out with is just a lot of annoying blather , most of which spews from the lips of lou diamond phillips ( whose favorite phrase is "" it's all love "" ) and robin dunne , who plays cisco's stuttering , black-wannabe assistant . 

the irritation factor of phillips and dunne combined is almost off the scale , which can pretty much describe the film as a whole . 
"
"george little ( jonathan lipnicki ) wants a little brother . 

after mr . and mrs . little ( hugh laurie and geena davis ) visit the orphange , they decide to adopt stuart , a talking mouse ( voiced by michael j . fox ) . 

george isn't so fond of his new brother when stuart arrives at the little house , and neither is snowbell the family cat ( voiced by nathan lane ) . 

george and stuart eventually bond while preparing for a remote control boat race , but snowbell wants stuart out of the house ( he's unable to live with the taunts of other neighborhood felines saying it's ridiculous that a mouse has a pet cat ) . 

stuart little is a mix of live action and computer generated imagery ( cgi ) . 

the character of stuart , while obviously a computer generated image , grows on you as the film progresses and you'll soon see him as much more than a mere special effect . 

there is also a great deal of animal training involved with this film , as many of the "" supporting cast "" are actual cats ( with computer animated mouths so they can speak ) . 

it's fascinating to watch these cats give performances without an actual mouse to interact with . 

stuart little is a charming family film . 

there are some great laughs in the movie ( with a script co-written by the sixth sense's m . night shyamalan no less ! ) , 

some moments that can only be described as "" too cute "" ( the boat race sequence is what won me over ) and even the majority of the one-liners ( common nowadays in children's films or films featuring nathan lane ) are tolerable . 

kids and parents will love this one . 

stuart little is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video . 

there are two different dvds on sale : one contains the film in full frame , and the other presents the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 66 : 1 . 

both versions feature choices of either dolby surround or dolby digital 5 . 1 audio . 

both versions also contain the following extras ( and hang in there with me here . . . there's a lot of them ) : a full length audio commentary track by director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson , a full length audio commentary track by the visual effects supervisors , an isolated score track , an interactive trivia game , an interactive featurette that goes step by step through eight of the effects in the film , a making of documentary that originally aried on hbo , and a stuart little read-along story ( which you can read yourself or have stuart read for you ) . 

there are also three music videos , and six theatrical trailers ( called thecatrical trailers . . . 

get it ? 

it's funny ! ) for stuart little and five other columbia tristar releases : the adventures of elmo in grouchland , madeline , the nuttiest nutcracker , muppets from space , and baby geniuses ( the only bad thing about this entire dvd . . . 

i did not want to be reminded of the awfulness that is baby geniuses ) . 

dvd-rom features are also on the disc , including web links and a demo of the stuart little cd-rom game . 

but wait . . . 

there's still more ! 

there's a section called "" basement treasures "" where you will find the auditions of the film's animators , six deleted scenes which you can select to view with or without commentary from the director , a visual effects gag reel , a production gag reel , and an incredible eight minute storyboard sequence detailing the original concept for the boat race scene ( with commentary from the director ) . 

the first commentary track features director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson . 

they give insightful and detailed thoughts about the film's production . 

minkoff likes to point out scenes where other screenwriters came in and polished up the script , namely writers like scott alexander and larry karaszewski ( who wrote the people vs . larry flynt and ed wood ) and lowell ganz and babaloo mandel ( who wrote splash and multiplicity , among others ) . 

anderson is very appreciative of the animators who worked with him and often points out which animator worked on each scene as they occur . 

the second commentary track features visual effects supervisors john dykstra and jerome chen who discuss more specific details of the effects in the film . 

movie fans will enjoy the informative first commentary track , serious animation buffs will love the second one . 

now i know this is slightly off topic , but it is related specifically to this dvd so i must voice this now . 

one of the music videos on the disc is for a song called "" i need to know "" by a group called r angels . 

this video features four mid-teenage girls ( the singers obviously ) having a slumber party . 

the girls ask a ouija board "" i need to know . . . 

who to do , who to do , who to do "" as the song begins . 

they then sneak out of their house , and along the way they strike a pose and their slumber party pajamas are magically transformed into middle class streetwalker outfits . 

then they head to a party and dance suggestively with the guys while singing lyrics like "" i'll be your pleasure all the time . . . 

just say the words that you'll be mine "" . 

um . . . 

what the hell ? 

what does this have to do with stuart little ? 

how is this in any way a song suitable for a kids movie , let alone a video suitable for a kids movie on dvd ? 

when the video concludes , the words "" to be continued "" appear . 

oh i can't wait to see who they've slept with when the toy story 2 dvd comes out . 

kids won't care about most of the special features on this dvd , but those of us who can sometimes be turned into a "" kid at heart "" thanks to a winning family film sure appreciate them . 

this is the way to do dvd , a good movie loaded with great features at a reasonable cost . 

the di$ney people could learn a lot from columbia tristar .

"there is nothing like american history x in theaters or on video . 

no other feature film takes such a cold hard look at the lure , the culture , and the brotherhood of white supremacy . 

nice guy ed norton jr . ( who sang in everyone says i love you ) plays derek , a twenty-year old skinhead . 

dad's subtle racism grew large in derek , after gang members killed his father . 

dad was fighting a fire when they shot him . 

now derek keeps his head shaved and has a giant swastika tattooed over his heart . 

derek is more interested in the ideas of white supremacy than in its culture of violence . 

at a basketball court , black and white tempers flare . 

derek channels the aggression into a game , black versus white , for ownership of the courts . 

when the choice presents itself , derek goes for game point instead of the sucker-punch . 

cameron ( stacy keach ) steps in to derek's life as a surrogate father . 

he takes derek under his wing and nurtures his racist feelings . 

keeping his own criminal record spotless , he uses derek as a leader and organizer for high-visibility racial intimidation . 

derek obliges by leading his younger and dumber friends in race-motivated mob crimes . 

at the bottom of the chain , derek's younger brother danny ( edward furlong , made famous in terminator 2 ) joins the skinheads not for ideological or intellectual reasons , but because he admires his brother and he wants to belong . 

one night three black youths break into derek's truck , which is exactly what derek has been waiting for . 

outside in his shorts and his tattoo , he shoots them all . 

the third would-be thief , unarmed , is only wounded . 

in the key scene of the film , derek commands the kid into a position where he can be killed with one glorious , enraptured , awful stomp . 

 ( the fun-spoiling nc-17 of orgazmo seems even more inappropriate , considering american history x was rated r . what sort of country is this that says sex comedies are a bigger threat to our youth than brutal , ecstatic violence ? ) 

the police arrive just as derek kills the last thief . 

derek does not resist the cops , and as they spin him around to cuff him , the film slows down . 

derek raises his eyebrows and smiles at his little brother in a chilling , sadistic , satisfied grin . 

now in prison , derek faces new challenges . 

as the black man in the laundry tells him , "" in the joint , you the nigra , not me . "" 

there is a clique of swastika-wearing skinheads , but they are not interested in the ideology of white supremacy . 

they only use the symbols as a means of intimidation . 

derek finds himself truly alone , truly in danger , and truly afraid . 

when derek finally gets out of prison , he finds that his friends from the gang have also changed . 

without derek's leadership , they have shunned the white supremacist ideology for the white supremacist culture . 

it is the final factor that makes him realize how badly he's screwed up . 

in the end , he spends quality time with is brother trying to undo the respect and admiration he had earlier inspired in danny . 

the film ends a little too deliberately , too neatly after the unchained emotion and violent glee of the rest of the film , but it barely detracts from the overall experience . 

edward norton gives an oscar-worthy performance . 

although some of his dialogue seemed to be written without enough conviction , norton's performance compensated . 

 ( an example that comes to mind is his pep talk before looting the store . ) 

he also captured the essence of an older brother . 

he took his responsibility as a role model to his younger brother very seriously , very lovingly , both before and after his change of heart . 

though clearly not for all tastes , this film is bold and daring . 

the subject matter is ugly , cruel , and at times hard to look at . 

nevertheless its subjects are part of humanity's great face . 

kaye gives us a good look at this fascinating , if distasteful , american subculture . 
"
"the heist of a flawless , 84 carat diamond , fixed bare knuckle fights , irish gypsies and a dog are just some of the goings on in director guy ritchies's sophomore feature , "" snatch . "" 

 "" lock , stock and two smoking barrels "" intro'd helmer/scripter ritchie with a hyper-kinetic , in your face underworld comedy that grabbed the viewer's attention from beginning to end . 

his protagonists were innocents set adrift in a see of sharks to swim or be eaten alive . 

with "" snatch , "" the director doesn't remake his first work , but he does delve more deeply into the criminal underbelly of london , mining a rich collection of characters in the process . 

>from the very beginning , "" snatch "" tosses you into the action with the theft of the fabulous diamond , the desire of new york gangster avi ( dennis farina ) . 

en route from antwerp , diamond thief and courier frankie four fingers ( benicio del toro ) stops in london to make a separate deal with avi's partner and cousin , doug "" the head "" ( mike reid ) . 

frankie's addiction to gambling tempts him into making a bet on an illegal boxing match for boris "" the blade "" ( rade sherbedgia ) , a ruthless russian mobster . 

the bet turns out to be a setup for a robbery by a trio of bumbling incompetents - vinnie ( robbie gee ) , sol ( lennie james ) and portly tyrone ( ade ) - that goes miserably awry . 

meanwhile , a couple of young toughs , turkish ( jason stratham ) and tommy ( stephen graham ) , are trying to break in to the boxing game with the help of local villain brick top ( alan ford ) , who also owns a pig farm . 

when their first fighter is put out of action , with one punch , by a wild irish gypsy named mickey o'neil , they figure to put the loose canon in as the contender in a fixed fight . 

mickey proves less than reliable and goes against turkish and tommy's deal . 

brick top , impressed by mickey's performance , decides to gives them another chance - after calmly explaining that it takes 16 pigs about eight minutes to completely devour a corpse . 

when avi doesn't get his precious rock , he jumps on a plane for london and hires a local legend , "" bullet tooth "" tony ( vinnie jones ) , to find frankie and the diamond . 

things spiral out of control as all these forces head on a collision course of double-cross and double-deals - and a dog that ate a squeaky toy . 

guy ritchie ( mr . madonna to some ) is an extraordinarily talented auteur who has a wonderful knack for pulling together his unique collection of cast and crew and feeding them funny and gritty dialog that spews out of the characters' mouths like machine gun fire . 

the helmer marshals his large ensemble actors in a frantically paced caper comedy that makes you laugh and feel queasy at the same time , the above description by brick top being just one example . 

the assemblage of actors and non-actors in rough-and-tumble settings gives "" snatch "" an earthy feel in its depiction of london's criminal underworld . 

the cast of characters is too large to credit here , but two of the performances - first among equals , you might say - are worth noting . 

alan ford is brilliant as the ruthless , evil brick top . 

when he refuses sugar in his tea because "" i'm sweet enough , "" it makes you shiver , even as you laugh . 

his is one of the best gangster characters i've seen in years . 

the other outstanding perf is given by none other than brad pitt , the name actor the movie's popularity may hang upon , at least initially . 

pitt , as mickey o'neil , is hard drinking , hard fighting , highly unreliable and nearly incomprehensible with a unique irish brogue and dialect of the pikers , the irish travelers of europe . 

this gypsy brigand would steal the fillings from your teeth , especially if it would benefit his beloved mum ( sorcha cusack ) . 

when brick top threaten the safety of mickey's family , he makes an enemy that cannot be stopped . 

pitt puts a credible spin on his character and does some incredible physical stuff , too , as a bare-knuckle boxer . 

the production team behind the camera includes ritchie alumni , producer matthew vaughn and lenser tim maurice-jones , and other talented technical artist that bring the hyperactive imagination of the author to visual life . 

there is a patent feel to the look of "" snatch "" and "" lock , stock and two smoking barrels "" that reeks of "" signature "" for ritchie , but i'm not sure how this will translate in his future works . 

there is so much talent in the filmmaker that i would like to see him branch out in other directions . 

nonetheless , "" snatch "" is terrific sophomore effort , a darn good action comedy and a hoot to boot . 

i give it a b+ . 
"
"in these days of overlong movies ( meet joe black , the thin red line , the mask of zorro ) it is a shame that films like waking ned devine can't be longer than a paltry 90 minutes . 

this is just a cute movie , even through its mildly risque subject matter . 

old friends jackie ( bannen ) and michael ( kelley ) try to find the lottery winner ( they deduce must live in their dinky town of about 60 ) so that they might kiss up to him and share the winnings . 

through process of elimination , they find that it must be lovable old ned devine , who they find sitting in front of his tv , clutching the winning lottery ticket in his cold dead hand . 

what results is thuroughly amusing , as jackie tries to convince his wife that not claiming it would be wrong , and that they could really benefit . 

after all , old ned won't miss it . 

rather than divulge the later twists and turns , i'll stop here merely pointing out that jackie and michael get into all sorts of trouble in their little sleepy irish villiage . 

bannen and kelly are a perfect pair . 

one slightly stout , the other as thin as a rail . 

both getting on in years , they make such a cute pair of old codgers . 

waking ned devine may even be seen as a "" full monty "" for the geriatric set , especially since kelly gets buff-o for one amusing scene . 

waking ned devine is by no means perfect , but it is so sincere and touching that it looks so much better than most films . 

the performances by everyone in the town are great , particularly the two leads . 

there is one twist at the end which i find unnecessary , but it hardly ruins the picture . 

writer/director kirk jones should be held up as an example to all those hollywood screenwriters . 

scripts as creative and endearing as this should be the norm , not the exception . 

perhaps it makes us appreciate this wonderful film even more . 

had i held off on my year's best/worst list for another day , waking ned devine ( officially released in late november of 98 ) surely would have graced the short group of the year's finest films . 

it is light , but thought provoking and sweet . 

i can't think of anyone who shouldn't see ( or wouldn't enjoy ) this film .

"miramax "" disinvited "" on-line media from press screenings of scream 3 . 

they ostensibly feared that folks like me would write spoiler-filled reviews and post them prior to the film's february 4th release date-unsound reasoning . 

you see , 'net critics established enough to be on any sort of vip list are professionals-miramax surely knows the difference between a member of the on-line film critics society ( ofcs ) and the type of fanboy who posts spy reports at ain't it cool news . 

no , the ? mini major' was afraid we'd let a bigger cat out of the bag than whodunit , that scream 3 is a dismal conclusion to the beloved ( by this writer , at least ) franchise . 

something smells rotten in the state of california right from the get-go : cotton weary ( liev schrieber ) , the former lover and would-be killer of maureen prescott , sidney's mother , is juggling phone calls in his luxury car . 

 ( once considered a danger to society , weary now hosts his own talk show , "" 100% cotton "" , a clever , if dated , jab at american pop culture . ) 

of course , a new ghostface dials him up , and , with memories of scream's unbearably suspenseful prologue in mind , we immediately wonder , where is the killer ? 

the backseat ? 

the next car ? 

thrilling prospects , to be sure , but actually , ghostface is at the weary residence , waiting for cotton's girlfriend ( kelly rutheford ) to finishing showering . 

what's missing from this sequence , and indeed scream 3's remaining frights ( most disappointingly , the moment when an ingenue is forced to hide in a wardrobe room filled with ghostface costumes , one of which might spring to life ) , is an elaborate and attenuated payoff . 

our other surviving regulars have become estranged . 

sidney ( campbell ) is living a paranoid existence of electronic gates and password-protected locks , while dewey ( arquette ) acts as technical advisor on the second sequel to scream 2's movie-within-a-movie , "" stab 3 "" , and gale weathers ( cox arquette ) headlines a gossipy news program . 

murder reunites them , as knife-wielding ghostface stalks the set of "" stab 3 "" , imitating its sadistic screenplay-and his/her/their own personal draft climaxes with sidney's death . 

the appeal of ghostface's villainy is that he/she/they could be your boyfriend , your classmate , your next door neighbour . . . or a combination of people . 

scream was the first of its kind : a slasher mystery , with the guessing game not only entailing who will be next , but also who is/are the perpetrator ( s ) and what is/are his/her/their motive . 

ironic self-reflection aside , parts one and two stand out in a crowd that includes umpteen friday the 13th and halloween flicks because there's at last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume . 

with scream 3 , the novelty of ghostface's ever-mutating identity has worn off some , but the character remains conceptually potent . 

conceptually . the execution of ghostface's master plan this time around is creaky , because screenwriter ehren kruger has invented a new mythology for the world of sidney prescott far afield from what we'd come to understand in scream and scream 2 . the movie gets in the silly habit of saying "" all bets are off ! "" 

in reference to the "" rules "" of a trilogy's third act , but there's a difference between rule breaking and cheating . 

with the departure of kevin williamson , who authored the previous screams as well as a tidy outline for scream 3 ( that , for reasons incomprehensible to me , was ignored , save the notion of "" stab 3 "" ) , kruger needed to be reined in tighter , and by wes craven . 

craven's direction of scream 3 is lazy in most respects . 

how else to explain the jay and silent bob cameo ( the slacker duo of kevin smith movies ) , akin to seeing mickey mouse pop up in mulan and more distracting than funny . 

it pains me to write this , but scream 3's comedy is generally laughless , with the exception of well-timed performances by josh pais ( as a police detective possessed of the same personality he had as a persnickety teacher in craven's music of the heart ) , jamie kennedy ( resurrecting film geek randy for the sendoff he was denied in scream 2 ) , and parker posey ( through sheer force of will as a b-actress ) . 

the visuals are much weaker in part three , as well-the occasional sweeping gesture of peter deming's camera is a pale imitation of the stalking steadicam craven gave us twice before . 

 ( aside : in the wake of columbine , craven toned down the violence significantly for scream 3-why the sanctimony , when scream and scream 2 are still readily available on video store shelves ? ) 

finally , marco beltrami's music cues the suspense too blatantly-do you recall the tense chase at the college radio station in scream 2 ? it's mostly silent . 

sting notes are a whole lot more effective if they spring from nowhere ; here , they act as the crescendos of an incessantly nerve-jangling score . 

i look at scream 3 as coming from an alternative universe , the same place that birthed the godfather part iii and superman iii-woefully out of synch with its prequels , scream 3 is a nightmare instead of nightmarish , and will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs . 

the film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of a trilogy to a t : ? part three must disappoint' .

"if you thought baz luhrmann's radical take on _william_shakespeare's_romeo_+_juliet_ was wild , wait until what you see what tony award-winning stage director julie taymor ( _the_lion_king : _the_broadway_musical_ ) does to the bard's _titus_andronicus_ for her audacious--and very bloody--film debut . 

while luhrmann transplanted the star-crossed lovers to 1990s florida , taymor keeps this grisly tale of revenge in rome--but places it in a surreal temporal limbo . 

the colosseum suggests the proper time of imperial rome , but high rises and heavy duty kitchen ovens suggest the 1990s , while the vintage automobiles and some costumes are more '40s and '50s , and other garments are more gladiator-like . 

as tamora , queen of goths ( jessica lange ) exacts revenge on roman general titus ( anthony hopkins ) for killing her eldest son , and he does the same to her for the wrongs she commits , taymor obviously wanted to express the timeless relevance of the story's underlying themes . 

however , the time convergence approach only works at times , for often it's just distracting , as in one scene where tamora's suviving sons ( matthew rhys and jonathan rhys meyers ) blow off steam playing video arcade games . 

taymor didn't have to resort to such avant garde time tricks , for the story would have resonated just as strongly had she jettisoned them . 

she is a strong storyteller and a master visual stylist , the latter compliment encompassing all areas , makeup and costume choices as well as those in the editing and photography departments . 

she also has a sure way with actors ; hopkins' titus is at once tragic and horrifying , and lange is sultry as the viperous tamora . 

the clear standout of the cast , however , is harry lennix as aaron , a moor who is tamora's secret lover and a schemer in his own right . 

lennix brings great depth to a role that could have easily been played as a stock villain . 

a great villain he indeed is , but to leave it at that isn't giving full justice to his powerful and multi-dimensional work . 

_titus_ isn't a complete success , but it is never less than fascinating , and it announces the arrival of a fearlessly imaginative new cinematic voice .

" "" i would appreciate it if you didn't do that again . "" 

starring jet li , bridget fonda , tch ? ky karyo , burt kwouk . 

directed by chris nahon . 

rated r . 

it's no secret that martial arts film often use their plot simply to get from one action sequence to another . 

when the fight scenes are enough to justify paying admission , there is no problem with this , as in most jackie chan projects and a lot of the hong kong actioners . 

when they aren't , well , we're in bad shape . 

kiss of the dragon , jet li's second consecutive american misfire , plays like one big miscalculation , and fails even as the most rudimentary entertainment . 

now before i start getting e-mails angrily touting the genius of jet li , let me explain myself . 

li is as spectacular as ever here , and i don't think anyone would ever dare call his martial-arts-star skills into question . 

the problem isn't with him , it's with the movie's tone . 

the much touted fight-scenes here are filmed with such unflinching , unrelenting brutality that they are unpleasant to watch . 

they're joyless , perfuctory ; li's rogue chinese detective is more of a killing machine than a hero , a terminator with a black belt instead of a metal skeleton . 

but even the terminator in judgement day had a sympathetic side . 

the plot isn't relevant , but if you're curious , it's some nonsense about a chinese law enforcement officer ( li ) sent to paris to investigate a possible drug ring and encounter a corrupt chief of police ( tcheky karyo ) , who kills people and does sinister things with no motivation whatsoever . 

oh yeah , and li's character is also an acupuncture expert who is able to ease pain and/or kill at the touch of a needle . 

 "" kiss of the dragon "" is the name of an acupuncture maneuver , in which you stick a needle in a precise location on the back of the victim's neck , somehow redirecting all of the body's bloodflow to the brain and killing the poor sap more or less immediately . 

there's a vague attempt to humanize li by having him fall in love with a downtrodden prostitute , whose daughter is being held hostage , for some reason , by the villain . 

this is one of the worst love stories i have ever seen on screen , even worse than the one in pearl harbor . 

there's no conviction whatsoever as the movie barely pays lip service to it ; it's only here because someone apparently thought there should be some kind of boy-meets-girl subplot . 

kiss of the dragon was written by luc besson , whose screenplay the messenger : the story of joan of arc , for all of that film's flaws , was at least thoughtful . 

i don't know why the guy got himself involved in this train wreck , but perhaps he wanted to so something more mainstream after the neverending weirdness of the fifth element and the aforementioned stylized biopic . 

i suppose you could call this mainstream , but i'll choose the bizarre any time of the day . 

if action scenes in a movie are going to be brutal instead of dazzling , you need a story to justify watching them . 

the filmmakers behind kiss of the dragon should have rethought their strategy . 

no one will walk out of this misbegotten project smiling , but i hear rush hour 2 is coming in just a few weeks .

"every now and then , reviewers are faced with the films that are hard to be properly reviewed . 

most of the time it happens with films that leave so overwhelming impact , either good or bad , that in the end reviewers must work hard to express his thoughts or feelings . 

but , sometimes it can happen for rather trivial reasons . 

i love trouble happened to be one of such occasions for the author of this review . 

the impression left by the film wasn't overwhelming - on the contrary , there were hardly any impression at all , since i had real trouble keeping myself awake while watching it . 

which surprise me to this day , because the movie theatre was full , i was close to sound speakers , the show wasn't late and i didn't lack sleep before the show . 

such things happen very rarely to me , and , after many years , the closest thing to solution to this mystery is probably the quality of the film itself . 

the plot revolves around two rival chicago reporters - old peter brackett ( nick nolte ) and young , aspiring sabrina peterson ( julia roberts ) . 

two of them are assigned to cover the train collision . 

as soon as they meet , they start scooping each other , but during the process they both discover sinister plot involving cancerogenic milk , and also the romantic feelings they have for each other . 

the plot in this film is rather secondary to its real raison d' ? tre - romantic pairing reminiscent of classical screwball comedies starring spencer tracy and katharine hepburn . 

movie author , director and screenwriter charles shyer , who had some experiences with turning the screwball spirit into modern setting with father of the bride , tries again , this time pairing old nick nolte with young julia roberts . 

however , although there is some chemistry between the two , soon it stops to arouse any interest . 

it probably happens due to poorly executed genre mix , that collides light-hearted romantic comedy with rather uninteresting plot suitable to pure action thrillers . 

shyer as director fails to make the proper transition between the two , and fails in both areas , making the story cliched and predictable . 

the end result is rather forgettable effort , which convinced me not to watch movie again . 

i'll give it the benefit of the doubt , though .

"although i had not been a viewer of the "" rugrats "" television series , i went into their first animated feature film , "" the rugrats movie , "" with a positive attitude . 

the trailer looked cute enough , after all . 

after seeing it , i think the words in my recent "" antz "" review , in which i stated that it was the worst film of its type since 1995's "" the pebble and the penguin , "" were a bit premature . 

 "" the rugrats movie , "" is bottom-of-the-barrel children's fare at its worst , and starts to make , "" antz "" look good in comparison . 

as in the show , "" the rugrats movie , "" is about a group of very little friends , ranging from babies to a three-year-old . 

the head of the group , tommy pickles ( e . g . 

daily ) , becomes distraught when his mother has a newborn baby named dill ( get it ? 

dill pickles ? . . . hardee-har-har ! ) and is informed by his three-year-old cousin , anjelica ( cheryl chase ) , that the new babies always take all of the attention away from the other children . 

when the other children , chuckie , and twins lil and phil , suggest taking dill back to the hospital , tommy goes along with it , but on their way there , they crash in the forest , and become lost , running into wolves and circus monkeys , among other things . 

 "" the rugrats movie , "" judging from the idea of being lost in the woods , could have been a potentially fun family film , and there were many different things that could have been done with the story . 

so what did the writers choose to do ? 

why , they set up a protracted , cliched scene where the children almost go over a waterfall , of course ! 

for the youngest of children ( ages 3-7 ) , "" the rugrats movie , "" may very well entertain them , judging from the audience i saw this with . 

of course , if you looked around at all of the older kids and their parents , they were all desperately struggling to stay awake , and that included me . 

for an adult , "" the rugrats movie , "" is a piece of garbage . 

the plotline is unoriginal and the writing has absolutely no wit or charm . 

there isn't one laugh to be had in the film , nor is there any excitement . 

if anything is even marginally good in the picture , it is the bright animation style , so it is especially unfortunate that it wasn't to service a more quality film . 

 "" the rugrats movie "" is doa from the start . 

i am all for a worthwhile family movie , but sometimes an animated film comes along that is simply awful . 

as said before , young children may like it , but even they deserve better than this . 

for adults , it is a nearly unbearable , excruciating chore to sit through . 

as for me , "" the rugrats movie , "" is not the worst of the year , nor is it the most deeply hated , but it is the most boring . 

parents : do yourselves a favor and take your kids to see the rerelease of , "" the wizard of oz . "" 

that is a picture that contains a great deal of magic and wonder , two things of which , "" the rugrats movie , "" is completely missing .

"with the sudden liberal emergence of personal privacy abounding in the news lately , what with that whole clinton thing going on ( you know , 100 million bucks to discover the president got boinked by an intern - oh , please , government , waste my taxes just a bit more , would you ? ) , 

it's about time tony scott helmed the newest action pic disguised as an important if not slightly ignorant social statement . 

with this and "" crimson tide , "" he's created two successfully chilly films that are interesting , exciting , even pretty smart , but never totally riveting as cinema , and the problem i think with each of these films is that each film is too obsessed with its message to ever be really satisfying , and too obsessed with looking all cutting edge to ever be totally smart . 

that film dealt with a civil war inside a nuclear submarine over whether or not to follow rules or question them , and was appropriately scary and all , but never totally thrilling or overly brilliant . 

 "" enemy of the state "" is the same way : it's engrossing for its entire running time , and it's scary the way that it shows a man's decent into kafkaism , but it's too technical . 

it's too cold and not as fascinating or exciting as it could be . 

it casts will smith , one of the better big budget leading men in movies these days because he's charming and witty and never uninteresting , and hopes that his charisma can make up for his character not being well developed enough to really be a person . 

i hate to do this , but last year's film "" the game "" got it damn perfect : it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human being , a man who is cold and has cut off everyone from his life , and then pulls everything he thought he had as a security blanket away from him and watched what happened . 

the result was not only a film that was exciting and chilling , but also the best mindfuck of the entire year . 

not that i want every kafkaesque film to be "" the game "" ( this year's "" the spanish prisoner "" succeeds with less thrills and chills ) , but it should be an example of what works and what doesn't . 

will smith's character is , frankly , too perfect , at least too movie perfect . 

he had an affair with another woman ( lisa bonet , ha ha ) , but his relationship with his wife ( regina king ) is basically fine regardless . 

he has a kid , and he's raking in money as a lawyer , albeit a very good and reasonably moral one . 

so he generally doesn't have any real problems as a human being , and is therefore boring . . . except that he is played by will smith , who embodies him with about as much will smith charm as he can without entering "" id4 "" / "" men in black "" territory . 

he's a good dramatic actor ( just see the first half hour of "" six degrees of separation "" for proof of this , not that he isn't great the whole time ) , and here , he makes his character likable and sympathetic without any real strain on his character , which makes the film lack any real deep interesting qualities . 

smith becomes involved in a mass conspiracy involving the assasination of a senator opposed to a government law that would create world surveillance , extinguishing privacy as we know it from the world , under the pretense that it would make crime easier to control , when he is passed a disk of the event caught on tape by an outside party ( a nature observer played by , uh , jason lee ) . 

the government wants the disk , and is prepared to destroy his life to get it . 

as smith's plight is dramatized , we are introduced to the masterminds who surveillance him , sitting in vans disguised as other businesses , staring at computers and pulling out tricks faster than a speeding bullet . 

these guys ( played by jack black , jamie kennedy , and seth green ) are the most interesting part of this film because they're , well , fascinating : they're doing their jobs , which are evil , but the film doesn't view them as such , and they almost become our friends . 

we like these guys for the sole reason that the film doesn't automatically judge them as the villains . 

they're also scary because we get the idea that they're not fully aware of the impact their jobs have on the world . 

it's as if they're obsessed with their jobs , not because they're evil , but because , hey , it's a fun job , and no one else can do it like them . 

unfortunately , this also backfires a bit on the film : instead of being the flashlight in the darkened room that "" the game "" was , you see everything , and are thus not as freaked out because you know what is going on . 

sure , you're chilled , but you're not exacty freaked out by what's going on . 

but what do you expect from tony scott , the man who never met a five-second piece of film he ever liked . 

he's a not-bad director because , hell , he is always interesting to watch ( if not occasionally moronic - exhibit a : "" days of thunder "" ) , but the reason he's not great is because he's too technical and calculated . 

his shots are perfectly executed , and leave nothing to the imagination , and they're always making sure you're paying attention . 

this is incredibly annoying , and it reduces "" enemy of the state "" to a mechanical mishmash of flashy images that never expand the mind at any great depths , but still manage to entertain without any real problems . 

despite never actually becoming great , it's never actually boring and it's always intriguing . 

watching the government set-up smith is endlessly fascinating , and since we care about smith's likeable protagonist , we are set-up for a good two hours worth of tom clancy-esque entertainment . 

add the best big cast this side of the annual woody allen film ( everyone from gabriel byrne to dan butler pop up for cameos ) , and you've got a good old fashioned escapist drama which does all the thinking for you so that you never have to actually question the debate over personal privacy and so you can follow will smith's plight without a minute's worth of boredom .

"it is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has not experienced the heartache of losing a child ? whether that may be in life or in death . 

after having said that , i will also say that this movie does all of the above very well . 

one gets that choking sensation in the throat ( because of grief ) when one brother forgives another for a costly mistake , or when a husband hugs his wife after a long estrangement . 

there is no ocean , no drownings and it does not conjure up memories of yet another ? ordinary people' . 

in fact the only thing remotely connected to the ocean is probably tap water and the toilet flushing ( not that this literally happened in the movie ) . 

so what are the lessons learnt : 1 . 

don't take your children to class reunions . 

2 . don't leave them alone in the lobby , not even for a second . 

michelle pfeiffer once again plays the role of a highly-strung wife and mother , a trend that started with ? a thousand acres' and ? one fine day' . 

my comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie , so much so that when she has a nervous break down , the veins on her temples bulge impressively . 

whoopi golberg also puts in an understated performance , playing a lesbian cop , with a name that makes one want to reach for a lollipop . 

lastly , who are the ideal companions for this sort of movie ? my grandmother comes to mind .

"the rich legacy of cinema has left us with certain indelible images . 

the tinkling christmas tree bell in "" it's a wonderful life . "" 

bogie's speech at the airport in "" casablanca . "" 

little elliott's flying bicycle , silhouetted by the moon in "" e . t . "" 

and now , "" starship troopers "" director paul verhoeven adds one more image that will live in our memories forever : doogie houser doing a vulcan mind meld with a giant slug . 

 "" starship troopers , "" loosely based on the robert heinlein novel , is the story of an interstellar war between humans and giant insects . 

in the hands of verhoeven , the mammoth sci-fi battle flick is one of the most astonishingly bad films ever made , a monument to inept filmmaking on a colossal scale . 

to put it simply , it's a bug bomb . 

in "" robocop "" and "" total recall , "" verhoeven displayed a gift for creating an entertaining mix of violence , special effects and social satire , and "" starship troopers "" starts off in similar fashion , with a tongue-in-cheek futuristic military recruitment ad that shows promise . 

things go downhill fast , though , as we meet our heroes , a group of buenos aires teens preparing to graduate from high school . 

inexplicably , johnny rico , carmen ibenez , dizzy flores and xander barcalow are played by square-jawed anglo kids who look like they just stepped out of a mountain dew commercial . 

it's a veritable "" alpha centuri 90210 "" as we watch the love-smitten teens squabble in the name of love . 

michael ironside plays their teacher , who waves around a cheesy fake severed arm while lecturing about civic responsibilities . 

eventually , the kids join the military , with dreams of glory in their addled little minds . 

one of their classmates , carl jenkins ( "" doogie houser's "" neil patrick harris , ) snags a job in military intelligence because of his strong psychic abilities . 

he displays his gift by psychically ordering a pet ferret to crawl up his mother's leg . 

a long , dull boot camp sequence follows , enlivened only by an extended coed shower scene where the recruits swap snappy banter as the "" showgirls "" director's camera roams over their buff bodies . 

finally , a full hour into the film , the war finally starts and we meet the enemy . 

the bugs hail from klendathu and colonize planets by hurling their spores into space . 

they attack starships by spinning around and firing deadly plasma blasts from their rears . 

yes , incredible as it seems , the bugs actually kill with cosmic farts . 

a phenomenally large amount of money was spent creating the computer animated insects and the results are mixed at best . 

sweeping distant shots depicting hordes of giant bugs racing to attack are both impressive and scary , but the close-ups are a different matter . 

the insects have an odd , artificial look , like origami creations with a mottled plastic coating . 

the attack scenes are intensely violent , as one would expect from verhoeven , but the overall look is too phony to generate any real tension . 

while the action is frantic , the military strategy , wildly illogical even by hollywood standards , grows tiresome quickly . 

verhoeven tries to spice things up by throwing in more satiric news coverage , but the faux-jingoistic scenes of children "" doing their part for the war effort "" by squishing roaches on a sidewalk aren't enough to make up for the long stretches of sheer dreck . 

one can only guess what paul verhoeven was trying to do here . 

his customary one part satire , two parts ultra-violence formula is way out of whack , and most of the film just flounders . 

in "" showgirls "" fashion , some scenes are almost bad enough to be good . 

an intergalactic kegger party , with jake busey playing "" dixie "" on a green plexiglas fiddle , has a certain bizarre appeal . 

a sex scene between two of the teens achieves a smarmy charm , enhanced a few minutes later when the female receives a fatal jab from a bug , but tells her hero that she doesn't mind dying . 

 "" it's okay , "" she gasps , "" i got to have you ! "" 

and then , of course , there's doogie's mind meld with a bug . 

it's possible that verhoeven was attempting to create an homage to the era of the original novel . 

heinlein's pre- "" stranger in a strange land "" books were aimed at adolescent males , and "" starship troopers "" has the antiseptic retro-future look of late 50s/early 60s sci-fi . 

the one cityscape shown is a jetsons-like gleaming metropolis , with flying cars whizzing past an obvious matte painting . 

the hairstyles are retro too , straight from the frankie avalon , annette funicello school of fashion . 

ultimately , verhoeven's motives are irrelevant . 

he has produce a gargantuan film that fails as an action film or as a social satire . 

it even fails to be an entertaining bad movie . 

avoid "" starship troopers "" at all costs .

"anyone who saw alan rickman's finely-realized performances in truly madly deeply and sense and sensibility will be unsurprised that the actor-turned-director is a bit of a poet at heart . 

however , for those who recall him only as the maniacal villain of die hard and robin hood : prince of thieves , this recognition may be something of a shock . 

nevertheless , "" poetic "" is an excellent term to describe rickman's feature debut as a director , the winter guest . 

the film has a simple , unhurried rhythm that uses all of the available elements to fashion a successful whole . 

the result is an occasionally haunting , sometimes magical , and always insightful human drama . 

the winter guest isn't about resolving plot threads and advancing a story line ; it's about exploring relationships and examining life in all of its stages . 

the winter guest does not tell a traditional tale , nor does it ascribe to a conventional narrative structure ? there is no real beginning or end . 

instead , we are given an opportunity to observe one day in the lives of eight humans . 

they represent both sexes , multiple generations , and a variety of relationships ? male and female ; young , middle-aged , and elderly ; friends , would-be lovers , and kin . 

we see expectations fulfilled and disappointed , emotional boundaries eroded , and truths unveiled . 

there is comedy and tragedy . 

most importantly , much of what transpires during the course of the winter guest will find an echo in our own lives ? in this fiction can be found much truth . 

the setting is small town in scotland on the coldest day of the year . 

it's so frigid that the sea has begun to freeze over . 

the onshore wind cuts like a knife and snow blankets the beach , giving the terrain an alien appearance . 

it is against this backdrop that the relationships of the film are captured . 

there are four pairings , and , although there is some interaction between the different twosomes , the winter guest's focus is on the dynamics internal to each relationship . 

the first , meatiest pairing is that of elspeth ( phylida law ) and her recently-widowed daughter , frances ( emma thompson ) . 

these two have a stormy relationship . 

they love each other deeply , but both are stubborn and willful , and neither is willing to admit that they need the other . 

much of their interaction is argumentative , but , during the course of a long walk to the frozen shoreline , they come to an unspoken understanding of how much each means to the other . 

frances' adult son , alex ( gary hollywood ) , is a lonely young man who has been caring for his mother since the death of his father . 

on this day , he meets a girl , nita ( arlene cockburn ) , who has secretly been spying on him for weeks . 

although their first encounter is antagonistic ( she throws a snowball at him ) , both quickly become aware of an undeniable attraction . 

once they retire to a place where they can be alone , however , things don't go exactly as planned . 

lily ( sheila reid ) and chloe ( sandra voe ) are a couple of old friends who are frequent funeral attendees . 

death is a topic of endless fascination for them , perhaps because they are so close to it , and they spend their spare time scanning the obituaries , looking for the next funeral or cremation in the area . 

it doesn't matter whether or not they knew the deceased . 

it's the ceremony that they're interested in . 

sam ( douglas murphy ) and tom ( sean biggerstaff ) , a pair of schoolboy chums , are spending this cold february day cutting classes and hanging out at the beach , horsing around , building a small fire for warmth , and walking on the frozen water . 

unlike lily and chloe , these two have their entire lives ahead of them . 

they are young enough to still believe in magic , but old enough to recognize that the process of crossing into adulthood robs life of the simple joy that only children can experience . 

the acting is strong and believable . 

the mixture of veteran performers and first-timers is effective , with the most successful choice being the casting of real-life mother and daughter phylida law and emma thompson in the most prominent roles . 

there is a chemistry in their interaction that would be hard to replicate with two different , non-related actors . 

and , of course , the physical resemblance makes it that much easier to accept elspeth and frances as parent and child . 

the winter guest began its life as a stage play in 1995 , with rickman as the director . 

four of the film's principals , phylida law , arlene cockburn , sheila reid , and sandra voe , appeared in the theatrical version before moving to the film . 

unlike several recent motion pictures adapted from plays , the winter guest has been successfully opened up . 

the rough , bleak scottish countryside becomes as much of a character as any of the eight humans . 

in fact , considering how important the climate is to every relationship under rickman's microscope , it could be argued that this is the single most important element of the movie . 

if you appreciate character studies , the winter guest is a solid effort with enough power to stay with you after you have left the theater .

"a big house . 

a big director , jan de bont of speed and twister fame . 

a big star , catherine zeta-jones , hot of the heels of entrapment ( 6 . 5/10 ) and zorro . 

a big remake of the haunting . 

and big special effects . 

so what do they all amount to ? 

unfortunately for us , a big bore ! 

plot : a hotshot doctor brings three insomniacs to an old , spooky mansion for controlled testing . 

unbeknownst to the patients , the good doctor is actually conducting his own cover project that has to do with the psychology of fear . 

critique : this movie just didn't scare me one bit . 

sure , it creeped and spooked me out a little here and there , but on the whole , it took waaaaay too long to get going , provided very little meat in the plot , went way past its own bedtime , and basically relied on grunts , the muttering of children's voices and over-the-top special effects , to scare us . 

well , this film didn't do much for me . 

and they might as well have called it the "" haunting of lily taylor "" , since she's basically the only character who had any real depth , background or reason to be in the house in the first place . 

don't get me wrong , catherine zeta was sweet window dressing ( despite my continued perception of her faint mustache-see entrapment ) , and owen wilson was good as the standard "" comic relief "" , but come on people , if you're going to have us sit through two hours in a theater with these folks , how 'bout giving them a little more than one-liners as dimension . 

neeson was also wasted as the smart , british guy . 

it's all too sad , cause certainly the "" idea "" seemed like a good one ( see the shining ( 9/10 ) for a close to perfect example of a creepy gone awry ) , but the story was thin , the conclusion was laughable ( be gone . . . poof ! ) and the special effects ? 

well , they sure were nice to look at , but not for a moment did one of them scare , or even for a split-second , have me believe that they were anything more than hollywood special gadgetry . 

see it for zeta-jones , or if you like special effects and scary movies that take forever to get going , and provide very little payback , otherwise skip it and check out the original or the ultimate movie about spooky homes from the netherworld , the shining . 

little known facts about this film and its stars : goofy actor owen wilson co-scripted indie favorites rushmore ( 8/10 ) and bottle rocket with director wes anderson . 

his brother luke wilson is also an actor , who once dated drew barrymore for a year or so . 

brother andrew is also an actor . 

singer lisa loeb is listed in the credits as having portrayed the character of olivia morice , but i personally did not notice her .

this film was originally titled the haunting of hill house . 
"
"this is a film about secrets , some that are innocent like those of a cute little farm girl , frances boyd ( ashley ) . 

others that are between a married couple that is impacting their relationship , like the problems of infertility affecting this upwardly mobile couple , geoffrey gaines ( stephen ramsey ) , the medical researcher working for a big corporation called fex and striving to get a patent for his experiment and become recognized in his field , and his artist wife , lillian ( miriam healy-louie ) , who reluctantly stands behind her husband suppressing her natural artistic tendencies in order to make the marriage work . 

and , still other secrets that have a greater implication for the world and are deadly in a political sense , of science carried out by the big corporations like it was a business run for the bottom line . 

receiving a summer grant to study "" chemo-electric therapy , "" geoffrey and his wife are hoping that a summer spent away from the intensity of the big city will bring back the romance that is dwindling from their marriage and that the casualness of the country atmosphere will give them more time together , as their three-year marriage has become shaky because he is more interested in his work than he is in her . 

he has slyly managed to keep his work as secretive as possible by locking himself in the lab , which is off limits to her , as he secretly goes about conducting experiments on rats and mice , convincing her that what he is doing is to benefit humanity with possible new treatments and cures to illnesses . 

his main argument is , that this is what the public wants , they don't want to hear about how some animals had to die because of these experiments , they just want the benefits of science . 

that he is depicted as a monster creating another monster , much like frankenstein was created , is the argument skewed by the director against his bad science ( science as a business ) as opposed to the good science ( science that cares about the small farmer ) , which is represented by the handsome and almost perfect gentleman , alex vine ( david ) , a young ecologist who chooses to work in the field , trying to get the farmers to go back to organic farming . 

he is hired by the university to monitor the dangers of pesticides and all the chemicals the farmer is almost forced to use to survive financially , as it is doing irreparable harm to him and the consumer because of all the health risks attached to this new way of farming , methods that have just come about in the last thirty- years and are being pushed by the big companies to enhance their profit margins . 

the third view in all this is the artist's , represented by lillian , who points out that the artist's work is shown in public and scrutinized constantly , "" why shouldn't the same be true of the scientist ? "" 

she argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public , questioning what is good or evil in society , something that bad science has completely ignored . 

geoffrey , impatient to get ahead with his research , feels bogged down by the bureaucrats in his firm who fail to provide him with the three chimps he needs to experiment on , as he contacts one of the company's higher ups to argue his case , but decides he can't wait any longer for their help , so he sets an animal trap in the countryside and catches chester , the gorgeous pet dog of frances , a dog that means so much to her and her family because he saved her life . 

while out in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car , he is spotted by alex and one of his co-workers , and nervously invites them to dinner with his wife , afraid that alex will spot what he is doing , as he rushes away from the area . 

in the dinner scene that was , unfortunately , flatly done , but was nevertheless the heart of the film , as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat , a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything . 

the scientists engage in a rational argument , highlighting their different points of view , while lillian reacts in an emotional way , siding mostly with david's view but coming at it from a much different angle . 

it was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies . 

that the director's point of view is absolutely right , is beside the point . 

the point is that the characters lost their humanity and became one-dimensional characters . 

geoffrey was likened to a hideous monster , alex vine was likened to his last name , the one who holds fast to the ground ensuring that the plant has stability , while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry and art , the inspiration for goodness and beauty . 

alex has been spending a lot of time together with lillian , as these two seem to share the same views and are physically attracted to each other , but when the time is ripe for an affair to take place between them , lillian changes her mind and decides not to go up to alex's apartment . 

geoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy , and the marriage seems to be coming apart and all his cunning tricks to possess her are no longer working , as it is now impossible to see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain with him . 

the relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely . 

the dog is discovered by alex and her in a deplorable state after geoffrey is seen by them electrically shocking it , and mercifully the dog dies . 

the only thing left for her to do is walk out of the marriage , but she also fails to respond to david's loving gesture for her to stay with him , instead opting to head back to the city . 

the farmer whose dog was tortured to death comes into the scientist's lab and knocks him cold while he was in the middle of a phone conversation with one of the higher-ups who told him all the animals he needs are on the way . 

what is progress ? 

what can one expect out of life ? 

is the small farmer about to become extinct ? 

the answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art , which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way . 

that this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions , leaving no room for deeper arguments , is the shame of this decent and smart film , that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white . 

no telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in ; it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic . 

there is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me , as i don't like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically . 

that is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit , that inspite of its shortcomings , it was worth seeing because of its visual statements , though they were also not too subtle , they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently , of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them , and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference . 

the stakes in this ecological struggle are that high . 

perhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film , was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene . 

it was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her as did the animal faces in picasso's guernica had for him . 

both artists envisioned the horrors that man could do against the world , and represented this unspoken pain on the faces of the animals so that anyone who cares to really see what is going on , will not mistake which side of the fence he or she should be on . 

the pain that lillian feels , as she forgets about her desires to raise a family , and she stares at her painting of the cow and the song , "" make the world go away "" blares out from the background , after she has learned that frances' beautiful and loving dog has been brutalized by her monster of a husband , all in the name of science , had a raw power to it that personalizes the dangers of bad science . 

perhaps , the most pertinent question the film asks , requires an answer that must be resolved by the farmers and the consumers who are most caught in the changing world and its new way of doing business , as the question becomes , can science be happily married with art ?

"carry on matron is the last great carry-on film in my opinion . 

made in 1972 , it still features most of the regulars of this genre . 

sid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit , kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting , head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac , hattie jacques re-takes her role as matron , and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr . goode . 

the jokes come in fast and so do the laughs , with humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard . 

this time , williams is after matron ( jacques ) when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr . goode . 

the doctor ( hawtrey ) is sworn to secrecy : - "" i assure you , that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other ! "" 

bernard thinks he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself . 

there are great cameos from joan sims , an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene , and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he's at work ( at the railway station ) . 

sid james' gang including cyril his son ( kenneth cope ) try to find out where the pills are by getting cyril to dress up as a nurse and live in at the nurses home . 

he has to share a room with nurse ball ( barbara windsor ) and she soon sees through him ! 

the film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospital's pills with panic ensuing . 

there are good performances by hattie jacques as the matron , however her character seems a little more subdued and quieter than her previous 'matron's' . 

williams is , as usual , on top form , but sid james isn't given a very good part in this movie and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all . 

the same does not go for charles hawtrey , for although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minutes gone and has scarce screen time , he seems to steal every scene he is in . 

by not making use of sid james and barbara windsor's talent to full effect , the film seems to flounder , but it certainly makes up for it with it's good storyline and it's other appealing characters . 

this film is genuinely funny and i could watch it again and again and not get bored ! 
"
"the thirteenth floor , the third in what i would call "" the reality check movie series "" , is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year , the matrix and existenz . 

all three made you think , made you wonder what is real , what isn't , and if our world is just a huge game . 

the thirteenth floor doesn't reach the level of originality , creativity , and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz , but it certainly gives a great shot at it . 

in the matrix , we were told that the humans are simply a virus . 

in existenz , we learned that our life could be just a game . 

in the thirteenth floor , we learn that we are just electronic devices , living under another world of electronic devices . 

there is just one world on top of another , and everything in them are fake and electronically generated . 

the thirteenth floor took a huge , risky turn that i didn't expect it to take , and i'm not very sure it was such a great turn to make . 

rather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film , the thirteenth floor becomes a murder mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds . 

after the mysterious murder of computer program designer hammond fuller , played by armin mueller-stahl , douglas hall , played by craig bierko , a man that worked under fuller for many years , must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller was using , to the year 1937 , which consists of computer generated characters only . 

the simulation of 1937 is just like it was back in the olden days . 

all of the people involved are just characters , or are they ? 

douglas strongly believes that a character traveled through the transport from their world to ours , and killed fuller . 

along the way , douglas interacts with many different potential suspects , and a woman who claims to be the daughter of fuller , jane fuller , played wonderfully by a talented young actress , gretchen mol . 

the thirteenth floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going , and doesn't use spectacular special effects and big sound to keep the viewer's interests . 

i was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix and existenz , and i wouldn't enjoy it , but there were enough twists and turns to keep me thinking and attentive to the film . 

unfortunately , many potential would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content , letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened . 

the scenes that aren't original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere , leaving you wondering , "" what is the point of this ? "" 

sometimes it was hard to believe that this story , with terrible dialogue , some bad acting , especially from craig bierko , and scenes that go absolutely nowhere , are actually true . 

i know this isn't a true story or anything , but a film should be able to make you think that it is . 

on the plus side of acting , we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine in 1995 actor , armin mueller-stahl . 

in the thirteenth floor , he is back and is still giving believable and amazing performances . 

another plus is gretchen mol's realistic performance , creating her character with depth , not just staying in the one-dimensional phase . 

don't expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out of the thirteenth floor , just expect another film that messes with your mind for awhile , and shuts you down like any other movie would . 

thrills , chills , and spills aren't what you will get in this film , but you will just get another trip to send your mind on , scrambling it until you've had enough . 

the bottom line- let's hope this is the last of the "" reality check "" based movies for awhile .

"guilt . guilt is something i felt while watching basic instinct for the ninth time ; the penultimate t & a thriller , basic instinct made my last few teenage years worth living . 

but i know so well that it's a terrible film , made by a terrible director incapable of feeling guilt . 

verhoeven went on to make the even more offensive showgirls and , on november seventh , 1997 , unleashed starship troopers to innocent moviegoers like me , who cannot control the urge to see giant bug movies . 

the pic begins with the most unintentional laugh of the year . 

a simple , white on black title card reads "" starship troopers "" -my friends and i speculated that the night before the prints were shipped , verhoeven realized he forgot the credits . 

is this how a hundred million dollar movie should open ? 

were the rest of the film that subdued . . . 

starship troopers is about a group of white , blond-haired himbos and bimbos who all have spanish last names . 

they graduate high school , join the military , and then , rather curiously , decide to travel to an alien planet and destroy all lifeforms on that planet . 

the story is so incomprehensible , and told so bombastically , it's akin to 129 minutes of someone screaming punishments at you in a foreign tongue . 

 ( aside , club lovers will be happy to know that dance music hasn't changed in the future . ) 

one plus : starship troopers contains some very funny sequences , specifically the newsreels of the future . 

hysterically funny , actually . 

but the cynicism of these reports left me curious as to whether verhoeven felt pessimistic about the story in between . 

the storytelling lacks focus , to say the least . 

the politics of the film are scary . 

the actions of the major female characters are dictated by their out-of-control libidos . 

there's even a creepy sex scene : the lovely dina meyer makes out , nude , with the sickening van dien while half her face is covered by her opaque sweater , just the way he seems to like it . 

i use the term sickening because van dien is the least appealing actor i've encountered in a big budget picture ; all chiseled features and machismo , he even barks a eulogy at a funeral like military orders . 

of course , verhoeven's probably the one to blame , and perhaps i'm jealous because i'm so disgusting . 

at any rate , a movie called starship troopers shouldn't be about sex . 

exactly ten years ago , verhoeven made robocop , which was about nothing but skillfully made and oddly moving . 

and r-rated , despite its goofy premise . 

maybe it's asking too much for verhoeven to make a pg-movie , then-he's a master of insipid violence . 

however , ten year old boys would adore starship troopers if they could see it . 
"
"in "" magic town "" , jimmy stewart is in peak form playing a pollster who heads to a "" perfect "" town to gauge their reactions on the sorts of issues that only poll-takers care about . 

however , as time progresses , and he finds himself falling in love with the town ( and a woman ) , he begins to see that what he's doing is wrong . 

the plot is standard stuff , but that's not important . 

in a film like this , it's the calibre of the actors that make or break it . 

obviously , since stewart stars , that's practically a non-issue . 

he's great in the film , as usual . 

there's just something about him that always manages to be endearing , even when he's deceiving the town folk . 

you're always on his side , and you desperately want to see all of his goals come to fruitition . 

the film was directed by a longtime frank capra script-writer , and it shows . 

this is the type of feel-good picture that capra is famous for . 

by the time "" the end "" shows up on screen , everything has been wrapped up very nicely . 

there are no loose ends , and virtually every character gets a happy ending ( those that deserve one , anyway ) . 

in this age of cynicism , it's refreshing to see a movie so upbeat . 

 "" magic town "" is a delightfully entertaining motion picture . 

if you believe all old movies are slow-paced , you'd be well-advised to check this one out .

"five girls spend a day in a closed building doing inventory when a strange box gets delivered there ( is this starting to sound familiar ? ) by mistake . 

the girls accidentlly open the box ( big surprise , huh ! ) and release an evil spirit of a killer that kills the girls off one by one ( betcha didn't see that one coming ! ) . 

hard to die , i found out while watching the film , is a sequel to sorority house massacre 2 : nightie nightmare ( r . a . m . r . # 

1521 ) . 

two of the actresses from sorority house massacre 2 are in this film , robyn harris and melissa moore , but they play different characters here . 

orville ketchum is also back as ( get ready for this ) orville ketchum ( yes , the same character from number two ) . 

yes , he is also built like a tank in this film too . 

i'm telling you , a nuclear bomb detonated next to this man wouldn't harm him at all ! 

the before mentioned three were the only actors from part two that i thought could act , well they seemed to have lost that ability . 

thankfully , for my sanity , i also saw the film warlock , which undid all the ill effects that i got from this film . 

the story for this film is completely ridiculous and has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks . 

any good moments that this film fails to make are even more destroyed by the story line . 

the film is so pathetically predictable that every moment has already been figured out , analyzed , and discarded before it happens . 

there is no point in this film that any suspense is ever afoot . 

while we are on the subject of the story , the story also provides every chance it can to disrobe an actress . 

the film goes to the extent of putting a shower in the manager's office . 

i'm sorry folks but this is completely unnecessary , ridiculous , and hurts the story more ( if that is still possible ) . 

the script for this film is completely pathetic . 

the lines the actresses come out with are completely horrible . 

the only thing that i think could have happened is that the actors made up the script as they went along . 

here is an example of the wonderful dialog . 

the scene is two girls have just entered a gun store and have picked out a * really * big gun . 

the line is "" my dad used to be a marine , i bet i can work it . "" 

this line has got to be a contender for the bad line hall of infamy . 

now , we fast forward for a few minutes until just after a big plan ( ? ! ! ? ) has been presented . 

one comment from an actress is "" not a lot of strategy involved , but i like it . "" 

i'm afraid folks that this is about as good as they get . 

now lets talk about the great special effects for this film . 

this obviously wasn't a big concern of the film makers . 

the killing scenes are so obviously faked that they go to the point of threatening the viewer's intelligence . 

a girl gets hacked with a knife and enough blood comes out to do one friday the 13th movie . 

are we trying to see how unrealistic we can get ? 

the continuity department was obviously asleep ( along with the viewers ) when watching this film . 

in one shot , actress has cloths on , camera angle changes , actress seems to have lost clothing . 

very impressive trick ! 

the one ( half ? ) 

plus that this film has going for it , is that in many places it is unintentionally hilarious . 

the incompetence behind the film makes it incredibly funny , and so the viewer can get some enjoyment ( ? ! ! ? ) from the film . 

however , this doesn't make it worth the rental fee of over a penny . 

in the acting department , the only thing i can say is two thumbs squared and one head down . 

i would normally do a detailed paragraph on this topic , but there is no point here because there is nobody that i was impressed with in the least . 

oh well , win some , lose some .

"the comet-disaster flick is a disaster alright . 

directed by tony scott ( top gun ) , it tells the story about an asteroid the size of texas caught on a collision course with earth . 

and you thought that dinky little comet in deep impact was trouble . 

jeez . 

after a great opening , in which an american spaceship , plus the city of new york , are completely destroyed by a comet shower , nasa detects the said asteroid and go into a frenzy . 

they hire the world's best oil driller ( bruce willis ) , and send him and his crew up into space to fix our globel problem . 

that's like sending a mouse into a cat carrier , isn't it ? 

the action in armageddon are so over the top , nonstop , and too ludicrous for words , i had to sigh and hit my head with my notebook a couple of times . 

i was not alone . 

plus , to see a wonderful actor like billy bob thornton is a film like armageddon is a waste of the actor's talents . 

the film is just a reel to show off a bunch of snazzy fx shots . 

the only real reason for making this film was to somehow out-perform deep impact . 

producer jerry bruckheimer fails with armageddon .

"susan granger's review of "" jeepers creepers "" ( mgm/ua entertainment ) 

this nasty , little horror film begins as a bickering brother ( justin long ) and sister ( gina philips ) are driving through the desolate countryside on their way home from college and spy a man dropping wrapped-up bodies down a drainage pipe . 

when long decides to investigate , there's nothing but trouble . 

 "" you know the part in scary movies where somebody does something really stupid and everybody hates them for it ? 

- well , this is it ! "" 

philips warns . 

what he finds in the basement of an old , abandoned church is a dying boy with a horrifying , jagged-stitched incision from his neck to his navel , plus hundreds of other mutilated bodies , stitched together on the walls and ceiling like a disgusting tapestry . 

long flees but now the monstrous , winged creeper ( jonathan breck ) is after both of them ! 

eileen brennan appears briefly as the cat lady and patricia belcher is jezelle , a psychic who explains the evil creature's bizarre feeding habits . 

on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" jeepers creepers "" is a fiendishly visceral 2 with an extraordinarily gruesome conclusion , giving new meaning to the old song "" jeepers creepers . "" 

and now - as paul harvey would say - for the rest of the story . 

what's more scary than the cruelty of the satanic film itself is the fact that writer/director victor salva is a convicted child molester who videotaped himself having oral sex with a 12 year-old actor in california . 

sentenced to three years in prison , he served 15 months and completed parole in 1992 . 

when salva made "" powder "" ( 1995 ) , the story of an albino boy with supernatural abilities , disney studio executives claimed that they did not know about his prior conviction as a pedophile . 

and now , once again , in this mgm/ua film , that fact is conspicuously absent from his press kit bio .

"'lake placid' is definately not your typical creature attacking people movie , ok so maybe it is , but this one is enjoyable , and clever . 

actually it comes off more of a comedy than a horror film . 

well the ending is kinda scary , but in most horror/comedies they are . 

i will admit that 'lake placid' isn't an oscar worthy film , but it does come off as an inventive movie that is original and funny . 

bridget fonda plays a palentologist who after finding out her boyfriend is cheating , is forced to go to lake placid and investigate a tooth , after a man is bit in half . 

she gets there but really doesn't understand why she is there . 

bill pullman plays a man also investigating what happened , along with the sherriff and a rich croc obsessed man , they go out and find what is going on . 

what they find though isn't great . 

a huge and i mean huge crocodile is living in lake placid , over 150 years old , he has migrated here for who knows why . 

they have to fight against the croc and try to trap him so they can study him and see where he came from . 

betty white plays a woman who lives on the shores of lake placid , and well you'll have to see the movie to find out . 

her character is very funny and foul-mouthed , which is surprising to hear betty spew words and phrases that are pretty bad , but funny . 

to me the movie came off as a spoof of jaws . 

with the opening sequence , and some others , it is not original and is . 

when you watch this movie , you definately notice the smartness and cleverness of it . 

david e . kelly who is the mastermind of the practice and ally mcbeal , writes this movie with ease and surprisingly does a great job . 

the characters have smartmouths , two foul , and some great one-liners . 

but believe me , don't take 'lake placid' too seriously or you won't like it . 

but it is a movie that can be enjoyed as a fun 'popcorn' type movie . 

but i guess it rates above the 'popcorn' rating . 

sit back , watch the movie , laugh , scream , and whatever you want . 

even though the movie is r , and i put violence and gore . 

there's really not that much gore , but what there is might seem kinda gross to some . 

'lake placid' is a smart , clever , funny , and scary movie that i enjoyed and i think you will too .

"one of the best movies i've ever seen . 

i'd heard extremely good things about this movie , and though the previews didn't really intrigue that much , it was a movie i'd been anticipating for a few months now . 

for some reason i'm not sure of - this movie was not that big a sucess over in the u . s . it was a definite hit with the critics , but didn't exactly set any box office records . 

after viewing this incredibly well directed , written and acted movie , i can't help but wonder - why ? 

the strength of this film is it's gritty realism . 

the main characters are all human with individual flaws , no stereo-type hollywood heroes . 

you may not agree with many of their actions in the movie or their approach to life , but that is what makes it so real . 

i had expected this movie to be more of a drama than a thriller , but i was mistaken . 

even the interrogation scenes moved at such a pace so that it felt just as thrilling as any car chase . 

and the ending . . . . . . whoa . 

i've never seen a movie in my life where everyone in it acts brilliantly . 

the three male leads - guy pearce , kevin spacey and russell crowe are all just terrific . 

the 'best actor' oscar talk surrounding this film should have netted one of them a statue , but there is one problem there . 

how could they have chosen between these three actors ? 

there is no way i could look at this film and say one of them was better than the other two . 

it's impossible . 

kim bassinger's performance is also a revelation . 

i'd never been a big fan of hers before and always thought she was , well . . . what's the word - a twinky ? 

that impression has changed , as she complemented crowe and pearce perfectly . 

the depth to the story and characters is truly astounding . 

no cardboard characters here . 

the plot is full of twists and turns and some very clever sequences . 

pearce's interogation of three seperate suspects is nothing short of brilliant . 

i really can't fault this movie at all . 

i was so glad to see fellow australian's pearce and crowe star in such a breathtaking movie . 

i had been very familiar with russell crowe beforehand from his many australian films , but had not seen much of guy pearce . 

i intend to change this next time i visit the video store : ) 
"
"contact is a film that tries to do several different things . 

it is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like , to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life , to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation , and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr . ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) and the religious spokesman palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) . 

the film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals . 

the portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable ( albeit less immediately engaging ) than , say , the cold-blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv's the x-files . 

the aliens in contact seem to be like us-they are more curious than anything else . 

they know we exist , they want us to know that they exist , and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person . 

the film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly , and between the characters' ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world , that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubrick's 2001 : a space odyssey . 

most of the film , however , takes place on earth , where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens . 

scientists are enthusiastic , ultraconservative religious leaders are wary , and government officials are caught somewhere in between . 

the debate is fueled largely by dr . arroway's atheism ; she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints , but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankind's representative to another species . 

the film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions , especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches - science and faith - could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed . 

still , the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society . 

the two "" sides "" are represented primarily by arroway and by far-right fundamentalists , but in reality probably 80% of americans are neither atheists nor far-right fundamentalists . 

palmer joss occupies something of a middle ground , but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a less-than-ideal spokesman for any ideology . 

then again , the film does concentrate mostly on public debate , which does , after all , tend to be dominated by extremists , rather than on dinner-table or college-dormitory discussions . 

contact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues , then , but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself . 

the film's one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss . 

for one thing , it resorts to the tired movie clich * that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together , as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction . 

the romance rarely , if ever , sheds any light on the characters , although it occasionally tries and fails - joss's explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement ( "" i guess you could say i'm a man of the cloth , but without the cloth "" ) , for example , is more like a punchline to a joke than character development . 

instead , the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments . 

granted , this is a plot- and idea-driven film and the characters are secondary , but this just seemed like laziness on the writers' part more than anything else . 

the successes of contact , however , far outweigh its failures . 

even if the social commentary had fizzled altogether ( which it didn't ) , the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film . 

contact doesn't quite cover all the bases , but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a two-hour film , and its rejection of big-budget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable . 

and i would not be surprised if , ten years from now , contact is mentioned in the same breath as 2001 and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction .

"capsule : the director of cure brings a weird and very complex concept to the screen . 

one viewing will not be enough to understand fully the premise of pulse . 

the idea is something about ghosts and the internet . 

the film has an amazing apocalyptic style . 

 , +2 ( -4 to +4 ) 

perhaps the most disturbing ( and disturbed ? ) 

filmmaker in the world is kiyoshi kurosawa . 

his films all seem to have one style , bleak . 

the worlds he creates are terrifying and cold . 

little known in the us to date , his films deliver the kind of horror that so many of our filmmakers promise and are unable to deliver . 

most of his ideas are fresh and at the same time morbid . 

his 1998 film cure , with one of his niftiest ideas , is just now getting a sadly limited release in the us and hopefully enough people will see it that his name will soon be one to conjure with . 

cure is probably his classic . 

last year he released seance , a remake of seance on a wet afternoon . 

that was perhaps a miscalculation inserting supernatural elements into a non-supernatural story . 

pulse is kurosawa back on form . 

taguchi , a young computer expert , is late with his delivery of some important software . 

two co-workers go to his apartment and find it a dismal dark affair in spite of his computer equipment . 

taguchi , acting very strangely , lets his friends look for the missing software . 

meanwhile he slips behind a plastic curtain . 

when he fails to respond to calls his friends follow him behind the curtain and discover he has hanged himself . 

if that was not horror enough the body seems to disappear leaving just a strange dark mildew-like spot on the wall . 

taguchi's computer seems to have been infected with some kind of computer virus . 

people whose computer gets the virus seem superficially to die via suicide . 

but they are not entirely dead . 

their spirits seem to remain present somehow in the real world and on the internet . 

people who get the computer virus are asked if they want to see a ghost . 

if they say yes , they seem to be able to see real time images of the spirits still nearby somehow . 

the computer shows them impossible images of ghosts in their own rooms as seen from cameras that do not exist . 

this is all somehow connected to heaven and hell somehow filling up and overflowing "" like a computer disk . "" 

instead the dead seem to be staying on earth and inhabiting computer viruses . 

there is some sort of passage between worlds having something to do with doors marked with red tape and strange electronic disturbances on computers . 

leave it to kurosawa to find a new kind of death . 

this is a film that has more weird ideas piled together than lifeforce and somehow kurosawa makes the film all work . 

it may not totally convey his message of isolation and its parallels to death , but whatever it does convey is nightmarish . 

kurosawa , who directs his own screenplay , ties his story into the real world with some familiar and accurate computer discussion . 

frequently the plot is advanced with character hunches being assumed to be fact . 

his plotting is frequently hard to follow and always very strange . 

junichiro hayashi , the cinematographer who recently has been doing all of kurosawa's films , creates a dark , cold , and gloomy tone . 

images are obscured by semi-lighting or are behind plastic curtain . 

scenes are not milked for their horror the way american exploitation films might . 

people are shot with guns but there is little if any blood in evidence . 

seeing black silhouettes on computer screens is not immediately scary . 

kurosawa is not going for and easy visual shock , but a deeper metaphysical dread . 

of any horror filmmaker in the world , kiyoshi kurosawa is the one to watch . 

i rate this metaphysical look at isolation a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . 
"
"to sum the entire film "" 54 "" up in one sentence , it would be : watch a vh1 documentary instead . 

 "" 54 "" , seems like someone brought william faulkner into 1978 , brought him into studio 54 , got him really drunk , told him to write about it , and then dumbed that down to be released to the public . 

a sloppy version of almost stream of conciousness spirals down into an oblivion of the illusion of sex , drugs , and disco . 

the narrator , shane o'shae ( ryan phillippe ) , works as a grease monkey in new jersey who , of course , on a whim decides to go into new york and try to get into studio "" 54 "" . 

phillippe gives a passable performance which could have been made by any young , attractive actor with a six pack stomach . 

he is let in by steve rubbell ( mike myers ) , the infamous co-owner of studio 54 , because he is attractive . 

he eventually becomes a bus boy and then a bartender . 

 . 

 . 

you expected more , didn't you . 

there isn't . 

the film builds up from nothing and becomes nothing as it's climax ( isn't that an apt word for studio 54 ) lands with a thud . 

the glitz of the club and perpetually semi-clothed patrons are used in an to attempt to show the it's glamour . 

for much of its target audience , college age to early thirties , it attempts to show celebrities mixing with "" normal people . "" 

this even fails since the only two celebs truly introduced are andy warhol and truman capote . 

you can be sure that half of the audience hasn't heard of them , another quarter only know their names , and the other quarter knew they were there already . 

the humor , if you can call it that , is built on an eighty year old woman getting high and 70s references like john travolta and olivia newton john making us laugh at how stupid we were back then 

the best performance in the film is given by mike myers as the perpetually high , sexually ambivlaent , very new york steve rubell . 

he seems to play rubell better than rubell would if he was still alive . 

he looks like rubell and sounds just like him while giving a subdued , almost nostalgic performance , when needed . 

it reminds you of his saturday night live character linda richmond on "" coffee talk "" sans dress and wig . 

the supporting cast of salma hayek , breckin meyer , and neve cambell are their only there to give added subplots which are introduced but lead absolutely nowhere . 

the romance between phillippe and cambell , as a soap opera star , is completely implausable . 

the two share about half as much screen time as there are shots of the eighty year old hooked on amphetimenes . 

hayek's wanna-be singer seems extremely forced and her husband , greg ( meyer ) stands in as shane o'shae's surrogate best friend . 

the subplots seemed forced and seem like they have been added just to make sure the film was over an hour and a half long . 

overall , "" 54 "" tried to give a view of the brashness of the place where crack flowed like heroin which flowed like wine . 

the film never leads to anything , has no obserable point , and covers up a lack of real plot with a veil of beautiful people . 

in truth , that reminded me of the eighies . 
"
"no filmmaker deconstructs a story as well as atom egoyan . 

i'm referring , specifically , to the narrative form . 

in the sweet hereafter , egoyan tells his story in a similar framework to his exotica or the adjuster . 

said story , of a fatal school bus accident in the small town of sam dent , british columbia , that shatters the morale of the locals , is told in a most unstraightforward manner . 

when the film opens , the accident has already happened , and stephens ( the wonderful holm ) , a polite ambulance-chaser , has arrived with the promise of a lawsuit that will eek out the truth of what really occurred that fateful morning . 

throughout , we get to meet the parents of the dead , broken souls who follow stephens like "" the pied piper "" ( passages of which are read during the film ) . 

but there is one living passenger , the paralyzed nicole ( polley ) , whose dark secrets of a life before the accident may affect her decision to testify . 

we finally do see the accident , about three quarters into the film , which is a stunning visual effect . 

a horrific long take that shows the bus sliding , then stopping , then collapsing into a frozen lake , is the best digital trickery in any movie this year and , perhaps , ever , in a motion picture . 

the fractured narrative also intercuts a preoccupied stephens on an airplane , traveling to meet his hiv-positive runaway daughter , as well as glimpses of the artificially happy lives these people led pre-accident . 

i have a problem not with the story or story structure , but with egoyan's heavy- handedness behind the camera . 

for the first hour or so , i can quite honestly say i was on the verge of tears ; these are miserable , miserable people . 

but that's just the problem : so anguished are these folk that sympathy wanes after a while , when a lot of sadness becomes too much . 

also , a subplot involving incest rings untrue . 

perhaps it wouldn't feel so contrived if it weren't shot in such a tasteful manner . 

there are two characters who are father and daughter ; when they first appeared i thought they were lovers . 

i was half-right . 

nevertheless it's worth-seeing . 

the delightful critic geoff pevere recently wrote that "" american films are about action , canadian films are about consequences , "" hence a recent wave of films about the effects of shock and death from toronto directors , including crash and kissed . 

the sweet hereafter is much better than either of these two films , simply because it's not boring or , in the case of kissed , afraid of its own material ( necrophilia ) . 

egoyan is a fine , fine , postmodern storyteller , whose work is entertaining , edgy and smart , if a bit too intellectual at times . 

though i harped on the weightiness of the material , i was always absorbed , engrossed , and surprised by the sweet hereafter .

"this film is worth seeing for those who want to see what mick jagger looks like when sporting an abe lincoln beard . 

the rock and roller is asked to carry the film as the action antihero of australian legend . . . ned 

kelly , the so-called robin hood of the aussies . 

but he fails to be convincing , in my opinion he is better suited to play gene kelly than ned kelly . 

the film opens to a b/w prologue of ned kelly bravely going to his execution . 

then it goes to technicolor and ned is seen in what goes for flashback , coming home from jail after a 3-year sentence to see his mom and reacquaint himself with the large kelly family . 

this scene is set in 1871 . 

in the background we hear the booming voice of waylon jennings , as he sings shel silverstein's lyrics , which tells -- of ned's hatred for the british rule and hope for ireland to be a republic . 

ned says a debt must be paid . . . 

as he hears voices from his dead father , his class-divided country , and his conscience , all telling him to get revenge . 

so begins ned's romp through australia's outback , seeking justice for all the wrongs his people have suffered . 

he begins by stealing horses , after complaining about the unfair tax law on horses that stray , which favors the rich landowners . 

when he's only 20 he forms a gang , causing him to hide the rest of his life from the police , who put a price on his head of two thousand pounds . 

when ned's mother ( clarissa kaye ) is jailed on a false charge of abetting criminals and sentenced to 3-5 years , ned offers to surrender in exchange for his mother's freedom . 

when the authorities refuse , the kelly brothers go on a robbing rampage , burning mortgages of the poor found in postal vaults and murdering some soldiers . 

rampaging through the outback , they gather sympathy among the poor and lower classes , who don't trust the traps ( police ) . 

spoiler to follow in the next paragraph . 

in the climax , kelly and his gang plan to ambush a train with british police , but someone kelly trusted tips the police on the train and kelly is trapped in a saloon and captured . 

ned's brothers commit suicide rather than be taken alive . 

but kelly's gang escapes , as ned heroically has the police go after only him and his brothers , as they become decoys . 

this was a flat presentation , hardly touching an emotional button on what all the fuss was about over ned kelly's call for justice . 

jagger didn't have a prayer in succeeding in this dry script offered by ian jones and tony richardson . 

the story failed to focus on australia , seemingly a more british film than australian . 

under richardson's lackluster direction , all jagger seemed to do , was proclaim his innocence and vow revenge , which soon became a shrill cry . 

if you want to see a better film about ned kelly , catch "" mad dog morgan "" ( 76 ) , a much truer and more daring version , with dennis hopper giving a much better characterization of ned kelly's madness , something this film could only do in a ho-hum manner .

"steve martin took an extended vacation from all facets of moviemaking a few years back ; he spent this time writing essays and short stories for "" the new yorker , "" several of which wound up in his hilarious hardback compilation , pure drivel ( 1998 ) . 

much of the book spares tinseltown from mockery , although he does riff on the racist comments made by marlon brando during a larry king interview , in a fine chapter called "" in search of the wily filipino . "" 

now , as writer and star of bowfinger , he offers the masses plenty of good reasons not to pursue a career in the cinema , perhaps finally venting the frustrations ( 'everything being made now is crap' ) that led to his brief retirement from hollywood . 

martin stars as bobby bowfinger , a roger corman-wannabe on the cusp of fifty and desperate for some success as a producer , quality of the projects be damned . 

his accountant ( adam alexi-malle ) proposes a movie called "" chubby rain , "" about aliens who travel to earth in raindrops slightly fatter than regular raindrops . 

bowfinger latches onto the idea immediately , and convinces his troupe of actor friends to appear in the film , based on the lie that america's top box office draw , kit ramsey ( murphy ) , has agreed to star . 

ramsey , of course , wants nothing to do with such low-grade material , so bowfinger , on the thinking that action stars need to run , not speak , decides to photograph the superstar surreptitiously . 

he sends his cast members ( who aren't in on it , either ; they are told ramsey hates the sight of cameras and fraternizing with his co-stars ) to ramsey's table at restaurants , asks them to follow him in parking lots , etc . , spouting script dialogue , all the while shooting the outcome from a great distance . 

the paranoid ramsey flees the scene nearly every time . 

ramsey is a member of mind head , a cultish self-help organization apparently dedicated to recruiting celebrities . 

 ( as if that's not familiar enough , mind head guru terry stricter ( terence stamp ) has been dressed and combed to resemble l . ron hubbard , founder of scientology . ) 

when he goes to mind head with tales of caucasian strangers appearing from nowhere to babble "" white code "" in his face , they fear the nervous breakdown of an important client and rush him off to a retreat , requiring bowfinger to find a stand-in . 

murphy will probably win more fans as jiff , ramsey's adorable , ignoramus double , than as kit , but it is his portrayal of the latter that took courage . 

always surrounded by an entourage , suffering from a racial inferiority complex , murphy plays right into the tabloid image of himself . 

furthermore , consider the enemies he'll make of popular scientologists . 

pacing stricter's neutral-coloured office as if on an amphetamine binge and stripped of his bigshot veneer , ramsey is asked to shout inane personal affirmations repeatedly . 

murphy's scenes with stamp are exactly what i imagine of a john travolta "" clearing . "" 

not that murphy is entirely responsible for this schtick ; bowfinger is steve martin's invention . 

his script is surprisingly clever as satire , given that the pseudo-religion is a sitting duck , as is the entire los angeles film industry . 

 ( the griffin mill-types take quite a beating , in the form of robert downey jr . as bigwig jerry renfro . ) 

martin's decision to tell the story from a bottom feeder's point of view is what keeps it fresh and innovative-never have we seen on screen a group of people struggle this hard to complete a motion picture . 

as expected , there are laughs only to be had insiders or buffs , such as martin's crew of mexican border-jumpers , who gain unexpected appreciation for the classics from reading "" cahiers du cinema , "" or martin's nonsensical explanation to dave , his loyal cinematographer ( jamie kennedy ) , that every movie , in the end , has a budget of two-thousand dollars ( ! ) . 

most of bowfinger is universally funny , however ; i defy any viewer to keep a straight face when christine baranski , one of our brightest comediennes , is on screen . 

bowfinger's main flaw is a plot twist that has an insubstantial aftermath . 

we're also asked to believe that a few simple close-ups of kit ramsey would redeem "" chubby rain , "" z-grade entertainment that would make ed wood blush . 

 ( this aspect of bowfinger has much in common with the ludicrous oscar sequence in oz's last directorial effort , the poorly conceived in & out . ) 

these are significant enough weaknesses that they distracted from my enjoyment of the piece . 

as i mentioned at the start of this review , bowfinger offers solid reasons not to do what heather graham's character daisy does : hop a bus to hollywood in search of stardom . 

that said , it offers one fantastic reason to get on that bus : the sense of community between filmmakers who gel is awesome . 

martin gets sentimental by story's end as he did in l . a . story , and how could he not ? 

for those who can hack it , the movies might be the greatest business in the world . 
"
"no , it is not a bad film , in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose , i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly . 

event horizon is not your run-of-the-mill sci-fi film , i'm sure many who have watched this will agree with me . 

it is not even original in that sense , and it does borrow heavily from films like alien , hellraiser and even blade runner . 

the magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical build-up that makes it wonderfully horrifying . 

the story brings us to the year 2050 , where space travel have since enormously progressed . 

the event horizon is actually a ship built for a secret experimental purpose ; it has the ability to fold time and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a man's lifetime . 

the ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after 7 years , it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune . 

a search and rescue team led by miller ( fishburne ) is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon . 

the designer of the ship , dr . weir ( neill ) follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship . 

event horizon is a sci-fi horror film , much truer to the word than say , alien would ever be . 

while in alien , the crew has to cope with a ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces , in event horizon , the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and horrifying . 

the story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb , up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud `enough ! 

i can't stand this anymore ! ' . 

there are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime . 

the story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also , the acting is only at most , average by most commercial standards . 

even so , the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film , thanks to its well-paced storytelling , disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences ( which incidentally , has been quite generously removed by our censorship board ) . 

director paul anderson ( who did mortal kombat ) and his team of `atmosphere' creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term `horror' . 

this picture did not do very well in the us box-office most probably for the dread-factor impact it has on most audiences ; people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this . 

although on the face of it , event horizon is mostly molded for mass-entertainment ; many thrills , spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus . 

however , the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing . 

my friend and i could not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the `experience' of event horizon . 

i guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us . 

be forewarned , this film is not for the faint-hearted nor for pure entertainment . 

be prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film ! 

event horizon is highly recommended ? ? but at your own risk ! 

it has been a long time since good-horror embraced the big screen , and event horizon is one .

"synopsis : in this movie , steven spielberg , one of today's finest directors , attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque ( djimon hounsou ) - - a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow prisoners . 

cinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders , but since the americans don't speak cinque's language , the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves . 

technically , since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time , people like cinque couldn't be kidnapped into slavery ; one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave . 

lawyers baldwin and adams ( matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins ) must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery , rather than born slaves , in order to get them out of prison as free men . 

three lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielberg's trademark panache - - flashy beginning , lots of facial close-ups , big music , and dramatic imagery . 

a final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters . 

opinion : making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life . 

in fiction , one invents purposeful , clear-cut good guys and bad guys , puts the fictional characters in conflict , and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion . 

real life , however , consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around , think thoughts and do nothing , or come and go before events are resolved . 

spielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story . 

djimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances .

"sandra bullock in high heels and wielding a chainsaw ? 

yup , it's gotta be summer . 

just when you thought the pointless sequel had gone the way of franchise films and direct-to-video releases , into port slams speed 2 : cruise control , the gloriously godawful follow-up to the 1994 sleeper about a bus rigged to explode if it slowed below a certain speed . 

the gimmick , this time , is an ocean liner rigged to , well , crash into stuff . 

sound exciting ? 

dennis hopper's disgruntled bomb squader , the villain of the first film , has given way to willem dafoe's disgruntled computer programmer , a maniac whose main beef has something to do with having to use live leeches , i kid you not , as a self-treatment for copper poison- ing . 

 ( and said poisoning induced by prolonged exposure to electro- magnetic fields , no less ! 

calling dean edell . . . ) 

so , he overrides the boat's computer , convinces the crew to abandon ship , and sends the remaining passengers , those who couldn't evacuate in time , on a col- lision course with destiny . 

 ( oddly , no one thinks to just . . . 

jump off the back of the boat . ) 

with keanu reeves electing not to return-- perhaps he read the script ? -- 

the job of john mcclane goes to jason patric ( sleepers ) , as the * second * la cop and swat team member that that bus drivin' babe annie ( bullock ) has dated . 

 ( what are the odds ? ) 

they're on this caribbean cruise for pleasure , as are a handful of requisite stock characters , including a deaf teenager ( ! ) who has a crush on the hero ( ! ! ) who also knows how to sign ( ! ! ! ) . 

 ( and you thought the raptor slam was a cool summer movie move ? 

wait till you see the feats that * this * little girl can do , when stuck on a shipboard elevator ! ) 

bullock is her pesky , perky self , though she ends up with far less screen time than her top billing suggests . 

 ( those paying attention to her bikini- and tank- tops probably won't complain , however ) patric is the main man in motion and that's damn good , 'cause when he stops to talk , he's only slightly less monotone than his predecessor . 

 ( his first lol line is to ms . bullock : "" i'd like to boogie with you . "" ) 

of course , nobody in front of the camera embarrasses themselves quite the way that returning director jan de bont does . 

he also produced this mess , which is insulting even by the most lax summer standards . 

 ( con air , buddy , father's day , romy and michelle's high school reunion , murder at 1600 , 8 heads in a duffle bag , anaconda , vegas vacation , meet wally sparks , metro , bevery hills ninja , the relic , all is forgiven ) . 

worse , he's spent a hundred mil on a premise that doesn't even live up to its title ! 

there's no sweat-inducing motion of the ocean here-- just two hours of shaky handheld camera work and a handful of cross-cut exteriors , all leading up to the big slam , when the love boat sideswipes an oil tanker and then plows into a harbor town . 

 ( oh , how far we've come in twenty years . 

remember the simple fun of seeing a locomotive smash into railway station in the silver streak ? ) 

admittedly , either of the aforementioned sequences is worth the price of admission . 

it's just the rest of the movie-- the other hundred or so minutes-- that's pure nonsense . 

and wonderful nonsense at that . 

i know he didn't intend to , but de bont has done one thing right : he's created the hands-down funniest film of the year . 

so , now , allow to present a few more things that made me laugh : 

o a box with a big label : "" fiber optic converter "" 

o plain english , whole-sentence computer instructions 

o an entire sequence devoted to opening a fire door 

o jason patric's character walks onto the bridge and immediately understands everything that's happening 

o a ships' navigator who speaks in a scottish accent and actually gets to say "" i canna override it ! "" 

o willem dafoe's amazing arm-mounted keyboard 

o two living , breathing adults ( bullock's character and the first mate ) who have to be told , step by step , how to disconnect a trip wire from the pin of a hand grenade . 

duh 

o "" no wait ! "" 

screams the ship's intercom 

o yet another damn dog in peril 

o fishing reel . 

pontoon plane . 

memories of weekend at bernie's 
"
"a welcome cinematic trend over the past couple of years has been to make the works of shakespeare more accessible to the younger audiences who are the vast majority of moviegoers by contemporizing the bard and altering the settings to familiar surroundings . 

a prime example of this is 1999's 10 things i hate about you , which was basically the taming of the shrew in a high school . 

less successful was last year's adaptation of hamlet with ethan hawke as the heir apparent of the denmark corp . here the setting was the corporate world of new york . 

now comes o , a faithful retelling of one of the most tragic of shakespeare's tragedies . 

like 10 things i hate about you , the stage is a high school - a private prep school where odin james ( mekhi phifer ) is the on-court general , the basketball team's standout player . 

julia stiles , featured in 10 things i hate about you as well as performing ophelia in hawke's hamlet , plays desi brable , odin's girlfriend , whose father also happens to be dean of the institution . 

josh hartnett ( pearl harbor ) is on hand for the villainy , playing the scheming hugo , who sets the tragic wheels in motion . 

o was actually filmed a couple of years ago , but was shelved because of the columbine high school tragedy . 

the movie , directed by tim blake nelson - best known for his co-starring role in o brother , where art thou ? 

- and written by brad kaaya , is very grim . 

an air of tragedy weighs it down from the opening scene to the closing credits . 

and that is how it should be . 

of all of shakespeare's tragedies , othello is the most harrowing , not because of any body count , but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by iago , whose motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery . 

kaaya's profane-filled script - after all , these are high school kids - does offer hugo a subtle motive of sorts . 

the young man considers himself the basketball team's prime utility man who does a little bit of everything - pass , shoot , rebound - but is constantly in the shadow of odin . 

plus his father , the team's coach - played with a ferocious intensity by martin sheen - showers more love and concern on his star player than on his own flesh and blood . 

the script follows the familiar lines of the classic . 

hugo begins dropping hints to odin concerning desi's fidelity , eroding the star's confidence in those he considers closest to him , affecting both his relationships and his game . 

it all ends in blood , of course , which is why the movie was originally shelved . 

the performances in o vary . 

phifer is at first cocky and self-assured , emotions he handles with ease . 

he also does quite well displaying odin's darker side ; his defensive sensitivity about being the only black at the institution , his growing distrust of those he loved , his rage and the erosion of his belief system . 

hartnett is appropriately cool and machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies and deceit , turning friend against friend , and lover against lover . 

stiles seems a bit stilted , but occasionally also rises to the occasion , moving from adoration to confusion to fear of her young knight . 

the film does contain a few missteps : a subplot involving hugo's theft of the school mascot is left hanging . 

also desi's actions concerning michael ( andrew keegan ) , odin's former teammate and best friend who was kicked off the team because of one of hugo's machinations , is puzzling . 

why she would continually be seen with michael - however innocent the circumstances - when she knows her man suspects the two of cheating behind his back . 

it is irrational . 

but these are minor carpings . 

overall , o is a stylish and faithful adaptation . 

if nothing else , it may encourage some people to read the original text , and that will counterbalance the severity of this feature .

"a life less ordinary ( r ) while the extremely peculiar a life less ordinary does live up to its title , a more appropriate moniker would be a movie more misguided , for this confused , confusing attempt at romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle , producer andrew macdonald , and screenwriter john hodge . 

at the core of this strange film is a fairly basic--and , yes , ordinary--premise . 

after robert ( boyle regular ewan mcgregor ) , an aspiring writer of trashy novels , is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation , he kidnaps naville's ( ian holm ) spoiled daughter celine ( cameron diaz ) and holds her for ransom . 

the joke here is that celine is a willing victim--her father threatened to cut her off financially , so she wants revenge--and that she soon becomes not only an accomplice but the brains behind the scheme , teaching the inept robert a thing or two about kidnapping . . . 

and , ultimately ( didn't we see this one coming ? ) , 

love . 

so far , so mediocre . 

but mediocre is better than dreadful , which this film is , thanks in no small part to the hodge's contextual frame for the romance . 

it turns out that god is displeased with the divorce and romantic breakup rate on earth , so the chief of heaven's police , gabriel ( dan hedaya ) dispatches two angels , o'reilly ( holly hunter ) and jackson ( delroy lindo ) , to earth to hook up celine and robert--or lose their angel status . 

this conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture . 

but it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film ; as it stands , it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand . 

not that there is much of a romance to begin with . 

try as diaz and mcgregor may , celine and robert are too one-note to become very endearing characters . 

celine is rich bitch ; robert is a dullard . 

as such , it is quite hard for the audience to really connect with these two--then again , they never seem to really connect with each other . 

when celine and robert start to overtly act on their "" feelings , "" it comes off more like something scripted than anything natural . 

but i am not exactly sure if boyle and company's point was romance ; honestly , i am not exactly sure what they were trying to accomplish . 

boyle juices up the visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz , but it remains just that--energy , not energy in service of a story or even acting . 

the cast seems lost , especially hunter , whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling . 

and then there are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film : some violent confrontations involving the angels , who are not exactly angelic--in fact , they end up staging their own ransom scheme ; some mystical hokum in the climax ; and a cutesy claymation epilogue . 

watching much of a life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell , stockpiling quirks in the name of cool . 

instead , the film just gives quirky a bad name . 

my best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic ( yes , misspelling intended ) whimsy , which comes through in only one scene : an extended musical number where celine and robert sing "" beyond the sea "" at a karaoke bar . 

after a verse or two , the couple are magically dolled up in snazzy outfits and hairdos , and engage in a spirited dance routine on the counter . 

the scene works not only because of its relative simplicity but also because it does not try too hard , just relying on the innate charm of the leads , allowing them to build a romantic rapport . 

alas , not nearly enough is built , for this moment comes to an abrupt end . 

i applaud any attempt to bring something fresh and unique to movie houses , but sometimes even cleverness can reach overkill . 

a life less ordinary certainly delivers something "" different , "" but by the time the film was over , i was clamoring for a life more ordinary . 

 "" i can accept failure . 

everyone fails at something . 

but i can't accept not trying . 

it doesn't matter if you win as long as you give everything in your heart . ""

" "" you'll go ape over tarzan because it's more fun than a barrel of monkeys ! "" 

okay , there's the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie . 

disney's latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning , skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship . 

father , mother , and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins , and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson . 

it's amazing , the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack . 

before you know it , an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala ( glenn close ) , a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard . 

against the wishes of her mate and family leader , kerchak ( lance henricksen ) , she takes on the infant boy as her own . 

tarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild . 

much of tarzan's young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his "" father , "" which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well-meant his attempts . 

all he's looking for is acceptance , perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers , but one which will ring true with a lot of adults . 

when you really think about it , this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end . 

look back on past disney animated features and you'll see the trend . 

growing up , tarzan ( voiced by alex d . linz as a child , and by tony goldwyn as an adult ) has a couple of friends . 

one is an ape named terk ( rosie o'donnell ) , and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor ( wayne knight ) . 

both provide the requisite comic relief ( timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind ) and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold . 

i'm beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films . 

just fill in the blanks ! 

can you see it ? 

 "" now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief , but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it . 

we've already had a fish and a crab , and we've had a candle and a teapot , a genie and a dog , a few stone statues . . . . have 

we had an ape and an elephant yet ? 

well , there we go ! "" 

of course , there's gotta be romance somewhere along the line , so jane ( minnie driver ) gets introduced about halfway through . 

together with her father dr . porter ( nigel hawthorne ) and the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , jane is on an expedition to find and study the wild gorillas of africa . 

she discovers the man raised by apes and is enchanted almost immediately , and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory "" you tarzan , me jane "" scene . 

thankfully , those aren't the exact words . 

however , i found it distracting that tarzan is going "" ohh ohh ee ee "" one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction . 

how does he tell his name to another ape ? 

 "" ohh ohh ee - tarzan - ee ee ohh ? "" 

well , regardless of my picky nature , the romance actually works as only disney romance can : purely contrived , but for some reason rather believable . 

but hey , tarzan's a young adult . 

do you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane ? 

isn't that illegal in most countries ? 

oh , well . 

i don't think disney will be using my quote anymore . 

tarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical . 

there's lots of music to be sure , but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time . 

we instead get more of a phil collins concert , as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material . 

this isn't really a bad thing , as the songs are very high-energy and catchy ( i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day ) ; it's just different . 

do yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system , because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie . 

with each new feature , disney animation gets even better . 

not necessarily by leaps and bounds , but since they put out a new film each year , a steady rate of improvement is apparent , and this definitely shows in tarzan . 

there are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3-d effect , and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying . 

the way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers , and had me thinking this isn't just tarzan , it's "" extreme tarzan . "" 

however , tarzan does not seem to have what i call its "" chandelier scene , "" which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort , utilizing a computer-assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking . 

lasting but a few seconds at most , it's been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast , in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail . 

as usual , the voice talent is up to snuff , convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters . 

the one poor choice in casting , however , was rosie o'donnell . 

going into the film , i didn't know she was even a part of it , but when terk started talking , i recognized her voice immediately . 

her performance was fine , but through the rest of the film i kept thinking , "" that's no boy ape , that rosie o'donnell . "" 

distracting to say the least . 

i'll admit i've never read the edgar rice burroughs story "" tarzan of the apes , "" so i couldn't tell you how true this film stays to the book . 

but unless you're a purist , you should have few objections to this film . 

with solid performances , action , adventure , a bit of romance , and great music and animation , tarzan should appeal to the kids and to the kid in all of us . 

note : when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago , i went off on the promotional and merchandising tie-ins prevalent with the release of a disney animated feature . 

this time , i'll just say that i went to mcdonald's yesterday to treat myself to a mcflurry , and tarzan was on the cup . 

'nuff said .

"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . 

be forewarned . 

to assess alex cox's film the winner as a loser would be so indolent . 

it would be derisive . 

it would be glib . 

it would be dismissive . 

it would be entirely accurate . 

rarely have i seen a film as excruciatingly annoying as the winner , a would-be comedy which quickly proves to be tedious , unfunny , and unengaging . 

the film attempts to be fresh and quirky , utilising a myriad of colourful characters to weave its absurd tale , but appears to overlook the fact that nobody in the film is remotely interesting and that all of the characters are essentially preposterous . 

the film is set in las vegas , and the focus in the winner is on philip ( vincent d'onofrio ) , an aloof , naive young man blessed with the odd gift of luck ; he virtually cannot lose at the tables . 

despite this prodigious talent , philip is perpetually mournful and quite indifferent about his gambling fortunes , neither taking joy in his winnings nor having the foresight to mask his abilities . 

consequently , he becomes an easy target for those who would ride upon his coattails and take advantage of his talent . 

louise ( rebecca demornay ) , a sultry lounge singer , insinuates herself into philip's life for the purpose of swindling him , while philip's estranged brother ( and , conveniently , louise's ex-beau ) johnny ( michael madsen ) arrives on the scene . 

 ( to add some colour , johnny also happens to be toting their father's corpse , sans one hand . ) 

meanwhile , philip is also befriended by a trio of low-rent , opportunists ( frank whaley , billy bob thornton , and richard edson ) , who have every intention of taking advantage of their new buddy's gift with the dice . 

serenely overlooking the chaos from behind the scenes is the casino owner ( delroy lindo ) ; it is probably not giving away much to reveal that his role in the winner is essentially that alluded to at the end of the flashy sequence in martin scorsese's casino which details the organization hierarchy of a casino's operations - he * is * the eye in the sky . 

it could be maddening to endure a film whose central protagonist is so oblivious of the ongoing blatant manipulation , but fortunately this is not the case in the winner , if only because our sadsack hero is such a sap ; not even remotely sympathetic or compelling , it becomes impossible to root for philip or even care about his fate , and the would-be swindlers of philip's fortunes are all drawn out as such ludicrous , transparent buffoons with entirely unimaginative and uninteresting schemes that one watches the winner with a complete sense of disinterest . 

it is a shame , as the winner features a talented cast - mr . d'onofrio is an underrated and gifted actor with a huge range ; mr . lindo has a remarkable screen presence which infiltrates every film in which he appears ; mr . madsen , ms . demornay , and mr . whaley have all done good work in the past . 

none of the actors in the winner are in top form here , and this film won't likely be a prized addition to their respective resumes . 

director alex cox does what he can with wendy riss' screenplay , and it is to his credit that this film at no point feels like an adaptation of a stage play ; i was startled to learn that the winner was in fact based upon one . 

while tedious , the film is well-paced and does not meander , but it would be near-impossible task for mr . cox ( or , for that matter , virtually any other director that comes to mind ) to overcome the film's widespread shortcomings in plot and characterization . 

to his credit , my understanding is that he has chosen to distance himself from the project in acknowledgement of its deficiencies . 

i caught the winner at its world premiere at the toronto international film festival in september 1996 , and in fairness it is entirely possible that the film has been extensively revamped since then due to the lacklustre audience reaction generated - there were more walkouts on this film than any of the others i screened . 

to be honest , though , i couldn't begin to isolate what could be done to this film to improve it - i assume that throwing the whole thing out and starting over is out of the question . 

the winner has apparently played on cable television in the united states and is beginning a limited theatrical release at the time of this writing . 

the film has a nice upbeat score by pray for rain , but i am honestly not being facetious when i state that the thing i treasured most about my screening of the winner was the bag of popcorn upon which i was munching . 
"
"the event of events is upon us . 

people have waited twenty-two years for the prequel to star wars and die-hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it . 

i don't think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused . 

it is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history . 

anyone who tells you "" it's just a movie "" is either lying or clueless . 

it is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic . 

the second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz ( which is far too weak a word ) that star wars epsode i : the phantom menace so effortlessly generated . 

but that does not mean that the film itself is bad . 

in fact , it is terrific . 

i strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash . 

it is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place . 

the film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging : the trade federation , angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small , peaceful planet of naboo . 

the republic sent two jedi knights ( people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as "" the force "" ) , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) to negotiate . 

unable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur , the jedi and the queen of naboo ( natalie portman ) escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene . 

on the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine , where they meet the movie's real focal point , young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) . 

he is an innocent slave boy , but "" the force is strong with him "" so qui- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi . 

as any self-respecting star wars fan should know , anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker . 

>from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor's movie . 

around 70% of the characters , if not more , are computer generated in one form or another , and though the effects are seamless , the movie lacks soul . 

i think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade , cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this . 

this is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far , with plenty of broad comic relief to go around , much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar-jar binks . 

he's essentially a computer-animated sidekick who says things like "" exqueeze me ? "" 

and "" mesa go now , okeday ? "" , and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying . 

the visual effects are astounding ( although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them ) and the movie is a thrilling triumph . 

if it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement . 

the climactic lightsaber battle ( oh , come on , as if you didn't already know ) , among other things , is outrageously entertaining and defines the term "" popcorn movie "" . 

what made me surrender and give this movie * * * 1/2 stars was the score by john williams . 

even though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days , his work here is nothing short of brilliant . 

his use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling . 

the phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia . 

when you see "" a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away "" , when the familiar music plays , when the words "" star wars "" appear on screen , you'll feel a tingle even if you didn't see the movie when it first came out in '77 . 

it feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin , a boy whose innocence , we know , will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side . 

it is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts ; we know that it will do more harm than good , but they do not . 

we not only feel more involved in the story , but we feel like we're seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years . 

the phantom menace , although lacking in human aspects of the story , is a very worthy installment in the star wars . 

it works as an action flick , visually eye-popping and often paralyzingly exciting ; it also works as an elicitor of memories , a piece of exquisite nostalgia .

"it must be some sort of warped critical nightmare : the best movie of the year would be a summer vehicle , a jim carrey vehicle at that . 

and so it is . 

_the truman show_ is the most perplexing , crazed , paranoid and rib-tickling morality play i've seen since i-don't-know-when . 

don't credit carrey . 

it starts with andrew niccol ( gattaca ) , who created the script ten years ago . 

the story , replete with sublte religious and philisophical undertones , is about a man who discovers that every day of his existence has been televised for a mass audience . 

 ( ironically , it was within these past ten years that "" reality-based "" television have become a predominant fixture into our culture . 

who knew ? ) 

one-upping niccol , it was when unlikely candidate-director peter weir took the helm that things fell into place . 

weir had the nearly impossible task to create the unimitible tone , deftly mixing capra with kafka , throwing george bailey in a universe inhabited by rod serling . 

it was weir's first stroke of genius to create seahaven : a suburban paradise/prison that would make spielberg cower in shame . 

for example , bystander-extras would walk around the block incessantly with flowers along with the latest issue of _dog fancy_ . 

the nicest touch are the plethora of subtle hints for truman to _not_ leave the island . 

credit weir for his second stroke : the casting of carrey . 

carrey seems to be the type of character actor who would always turn "" on "" and act goofy whenever the camera is near . 

not here . 

his performance is so subverted you sometimes wonder if he is ever aware the camera is on . 

and although carrey does not deserve an academy award nomination ( just as well , the academy rarely honors goofy comedians , excepting robin williams ) , he stretches enough to alter his hyper-silly image considerably . 

playing one who has the cameras constantly invading his most intimate moments turns to be quite the role of jim carrey's life . 

no pun intended . 

better in a smaller , more pivotal role is ed harris as christof , who mixes the right amount of his apollo 13 "" work the problem , people "" character with dustin hoffman's megaglomaniac producer in _wag the dog_ , and then only slightly svengalian . 

it is clear that he is torn between the nielson ratings and truman's well being . 

yes , in his own misguided way he loves truman as a father to a son , and has provided the best universe he could provide . 

he thinks . 

rounding out the cast is natascha mcelhone ( mrs . 

dalloway ) as carrey's true "" forbidden love "" , sylvia , very effective in another pivotal small role . 

laura linney ( congo ) and noah emmerich ( copland ) have the unfortunate task of playing truman's wife and best friend ; their sitcom-ish dialogue allow little room for any authentic character development . 

the exception is at the very beginning , where they speak into the camera , wholeheartedly believing that their participation is truly good for truman , and for society in general . 

there are other little problems with the script . 

are we to assume that toddler truman had no recollection of hearing the construction of such a gigantic dome during his formative years ? 

was there any reason as to why in one scene , it rained solely on truman , even though it never had to ? 

how is it they hire hundreds of extras , and none of them could drive a boat , and yet truman , fearful of water , is helming a sailboat effortlessly ? 

and couldn't christof have turned off the wind , to strand truman at sea ? 

these little contrivances , however , do not hold a candle to the overall effect of the work . 

the audience gets the feeling that it is watching the actual show , and we are drawn to truman's mundane existence for no other reason than it is there . 

the final result effortlessly combines the emotional happy ending of a mainstream picture with a gnawing discomfort that hits you square in the gut . 

upon leaving the theater , i was looking up in the sky , wondering if it was nothing more than a gigantic dome . 

just checking . 
"
"there was probably a good reason that the warner bros . studio chose not to allow critics to view this steven seagal film when it first opened . 

and , after seeing this piece of toxic waste , i now know why . 

this movie is by far the worst offering that has hit the screen since possibly those ernest movies years ago . 

fire down below centers its story on a little mining town in god's country , somewhere in eastern kentucky . 

it's beauty and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed by an uncaring mining magnate ( kris kristopherson , who constantly looks like he wants to kill his agent for getting him this role ) . 

it turns out that he's filling the mines throughout kentucky with toxic waste for a tidy profit . 

seagal plays jack taggert , an aikido-versed , fighting machine , who is an agent with the epa . 

no . . . not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa . 

it's the environmental protection agency . 

i had no idea that epa agents were trained to be killers ! 

taggert is sent to find the perpetrators and to bring them to justice . 

written by someone named jeb , i could already envision the stereotypes of incestuous relationships , banjo-picking preachers , and dumb-as-nails rednecks . 

but the script puts seagal right smack dab in the middle of all of these scenarios as he tries to discreetly fit in . 

seagal's idea of a disguise is a long-length $1000 leather jacket . 

but to get closer to the kinfolk , he will fix people's porches for free . 

that's another great epa asset - teaching agents how to fix porches . 

slow and plodding , this project is a total mess . 

the sometimes allure of watching seagal is watching him outmaneuver enemies that outnumber and outgun him like in under seige . 

here , his bravado basically turns into bullyness . 

townsfolk who are foolish enough to challenge seagal are quickly subdued . 

fight scenes are quick and senseless and offers no enjoyment value whatsoever . 

and his soap box message wears thin within the first 15 minutes . 

the most annoying moment comes when he barges into the middle of a sunday church ceremony , gets behind the pulpit , and beseeches the townsfolk to take control of their lives and to help clean up the environment . 

but the epitome of how moralistically mushy this film gets happens when the person responsible for the toxic dumping , kristopherson , meets up with seagal . 

kristopherson asks seagal how much it will take for him to go away . 

seagal gallantly replies : "" i'll leave when you take the poison from the streams and the earth . "" 

i was expecting patriotic music to start blasting and a show of fireworks in the background . 

this is truly nothing more than a pompous showcase for seagal's righteousness and narcissistic arrogance . 

seagal has been vanguard in trying to bring a new genre into the filmplace , that of the enviro-thriller ( on deadly ground ) . 

however , the message will never come across through poorly developed vehicles like this . 

still , i believe in preserving mother earth , so save your $5 and please donate it instead to some worthy environmentally conscious charity .

"seen september 5 , 1998 at 10 p . m . at the sony nickelodeon theaters ( boston , ma ) , theater #2 , with matt perreault for free using my sony/loews critic's pass . 

[theater rating : * * 1/2 : okay seats , sound , and picture] 

modern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before , from teenage sitcoms to nc-17-rated films about fetishes . 

the biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it . 

 "" your friends and neighbors "" takes a different approach as it's a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends . 

one of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer/director neil labute's basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story . 

firstly , and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex , detailed story of lust , betrayal , arrogance , hypocrisy , greed , and just plain stupidity between six different characters ( three men , three women ) , without hardly any supporting characters , ( a few have a line or two ) , mostly extras . 

everything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full-circle back to themselves , whether it be positive or negative . 

but to just state this is arbitrary , and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult . 

labute's ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat , but what's specifically impressive is the fact the characters' names are never revealed until the end credits roll . 

for the sake of this review , i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic . 

another interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus . 

we're always able to tell where the characters are ( someone's home , the gym , a restaurant , hotel room , etc . ) , but what the city they live in , what year it is , what the society is like , etc . is relatively unknown . 

the film is a complete character study with the tight , intense drama of the theater . 

no one plot dominates the story , which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background . 

we're simply dropped in on the characters' lives and are expected to figure out the rest . 

the characters are a group of middle-class white people who are all successful at what they do , but they're only concern right now seems to be their sex lives . 

first there's barry ( eckhart ) and mary ( brenneman ) , a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who don't know what they're problem is . 

barry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife , and the sex they have , but doesn't have a lot of ambition - he just follows everyone else . 

mary is a writer of some sort , but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character , but ironically , doesn't hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something . 

labute's script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals , but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two . 

obviously , this is the theme , which is enhanced by the actors' good performances , but at the same time seems just a bit hollow . 

another couple is jerry ( stiller ) and terri ( keener ) who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time , yet they constantly argue over anything and everything . 

their sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship . 

if only one aspect of the film could use improvement , it would be this area . 

it's natural for a married couple to become bored with each other , but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together ? 

what did they ever see in the other person to begin with ? 

labute never really answers , but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process , it still makes for good drama , tension , and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful it's fascinating . 

two other characters act as catalysts , cary ( jason patric ) and cheri ( natassja kinski ) . 

cary is an arrogant , hostile sex-maniac who defines the word "" bastard . "" 

somehow he is able to bend women to his will , either through charm or just attitude , into getting his way . 

he's the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize he's secretly perverted , but somehow barry finds comfort in his company , although jerry is always nervous around him . 

patric gives an outstanding performance , so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is . 

cheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her . 

she works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film , each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different , from becoming involved in a relationship with one , to brushing it off as small talk with another , to being outright appalled by yet another . 

she's a sweet woman , perhaps the most normal of any of the characters , and although her symbolism is obvious , her role as the outsider is the most relatable . 

i will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others' action , as that's the hook of the film . 

the first two acts begin to set up the characters and each's scenarios , but it's often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom . 

the result is sometimes surprising , other times predictable , but the actual course of actions is always fascinating . 

for a while everyone has their fun , but ultimately each character's guilt , attitude , or ignorance will disserve them . 

one of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be . 

since the characters only interact with each other there isn't much pop culture references , as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it . 

are we to assume that these people are , as the title states , our friends and neighbors ? 

i don't know of anyone going through the same situations as these people . 

often times the film is not unlike a network melodrama , other times situations are like those not seen outside a porno movie . 

but what this film does have that the others don't is repercussions in the end . 

although the film creates its own reality , it goes to show that even the immoral aren't immortal . 

in what way "" your friends and neighbors "" is supposed to work is open to interpretation . 

it definitely has a lot to say about the price that comes with infidelity , but it could have been even better had it expanded on that theme more specifically . 

still , it's an accomplishment in film-making because it has put a timeless theme into a modern perspective .

"steven spielberg is now considered as one of the hollywood deities , because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits , like jurassic park , and "" oscar "" -awarded critical triumphs like schindler's list . 

however , in the 1970s spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art that could slip in both categories . 

one of them is close encounters of the third kind , extremely popular and influential science-fiction spectacle . 

unfortunately , it had a bad luck to be released in the same year as star wars . 

although both films have a lot in common ( ground-breaking special effects , brilliant score by john williams ) their future was different ; one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon , and another almost forgotten and stuck forever in its shadow . 

when spielberg began work on that project , he was already established as a bright new hollywood star due to his previous commercial hit , jaws . 

together with other young directors of his "" new hollywood "" generation , like kauffman , carpenter , hill and millius , he exploited the great creative freedom of 1970s , when even the mainstream producers dared to experiment . 

ironically , it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of "" blockubuster "" philosophy . 

but in the mid 1970s , many things were different ; spielberg was young and eager to use hollywood resources for his very personal and artistic movie . 

although very personal , spielberg's screenplay was partly based on the book "" ufo experience "" by dr . j . allen hynek and in many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology of extraterrestrial visitors to earth that began to grow in the world after ww2 . 

spielberg was not only inspired by the mythology , but his movie also gave the mythology itself a huge boost , unmatched until the contemporary era of x-files and the roswell anniversary . 

that was partly because he made the movie very realistic using the authentic ufo-related incidents as the element of the plot . 

the story begins with one of such incidents - team of international scientists come to the sonorra desert in mexico to find the u . s . navy planes of who went missing decades ago during the famous flight 19 . 

such events coincide with the ufo incident witnessed by roy neary ( richard dreyfuss ) , power company worker from muncie , indiana , who later becomes obsessed with his experience . 

because of his obsession he loses his job , family and sanity , but his loss is nothing compared to the experience of jillian guiler ( melinda dillon ) , single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction . 

in the meantime , the scientists decipher the strange signals from outer space and u . s . government , in co-operation with the french , led by lacombe ( francois truffaut ) begin with the preparation for ultra-secret project . 

when the news of the poison gas leak in the middle of wyoming reach neary , he finally sees some sense in all his visions and begins the perilous journey toward the centre of endangered area . 

there he is joined by jillian who shared the similar visions . 

two of them must break through military pickets and reach their destination to find whatever is there . 

spielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws to make completely different effects . 

the slow , gradual yet very disciplined series of dramatic incidents - "" close encounters "" - is set in order to bring the viewer to the great revelation in the finale . 

but , instead of the fear and horror we had to endure during the jaws , we are now overwhelmed by the sense of boyish wonder . 

throughout the movie the viewer knows that something big , magnificent and wonderful is about to happen , and great magician spielberg delivers his promise in the end . 

the last sequence , with its , even in this age , impressive special effects by the great virtuoso douglas trumbull , would leave many mouths open . 

one of the great virtues of this film is its optimism . 

aliens , who almost always get portrayed as the monsters in science-fiction cinema , are here benevolent and harmless creatures and the first contact between them and humanity is a beginning of something wonderful . 

it is very ironic , when we consider that the two classic sf movies that visually inspired spielberg actually told quite different story - howard hawks' thing and byron haskin's war of the worlds presented extraterrestrials as the threat to the mankind . 

spielberg's humane approach and faith in the future also lies in great contrast to the pessimistic mood of its era ; the only hint of the contemporary gloom is post-watergate portrayal of government as conspiratorial towards the public . 

but , even such government is much more harmless compared to the murderous and chain-smoking men in black that became the stereotype thanks to x-files and its more cynical and disturbing visions . 

there lies the main , and probably the only flaw of this great picture - lack of conflict , and consequently , lack of drama . 

the movie has few excitements or even action scenes ( especially the last that may be an interesting homage to hitchcock's north by northwest ) but generally , almost everyone - neary , jillian , government , aliens - are the good guys . 

despite such shortcomings , the actors were good and manage to bring multidimensionality to their simple roles . 

richard dreyfuss is very convincing as a ordinary , yet nice guy , who sinks into insanity only to rediscover himself in a grand finale . 

melinda dillon was , on the other hand , nominated for "" oscar "" as a struggling mother , yet she was overshadowed by teri garr as neary's long-suffering wife ronnie . 

apart from visual wonders of this film , spielberg's semi-official composer john williams again excels by his beautiful music , this time using the simple melody both as the element of a plot , and as the basis for his score . 

the aliens , who are the main subject of this film , were visually very convincing . 

too convincing , one of my acquaintances in the ufo-researching circles said . 

according to him , the depiction of extraterrestrials as grey-skinned little people with big eyes was so accurate , that it managed to freak out powerful government figures interested in suppressing the truth about ufos . 

so , they later approached spielberg and ordered him to make another movie with alien , this time designed to be anything but the real life . 

the result was e . t . , for many years the biggest commercial hit of all times , yet less inspirational for ufo enthusiasts . 

anyway , whether the viewer believes in existence of extraterrestrials or ufos , close encounters of the third kind remains the great movie , and one of the rare uplifting experiences in modern cinema .

"today , war became a reality to me after seeing a screening of saving priivate ryan . 

steve spielberg goes beyond reality with his latest production . 

the audience is tossed about the theatre witnessing the horror of war . 

please keep the kids home as the r rating is for reality . 

tom hanks is stunning as capt john miller , set out in france during ww ii to rescue and return home a soldier , private ryan ( matt damon ) who lost three brothers in the war . 

spielberg at time takes us inside the heads of these individuals as they face death during the horrific battle scenes . 

private ryan is not for everyone , but i felt the time was right for a movie like this to be made . 

the movie reminds us of the sacrifices made by our ww ii fighting men and women . 

we must not ever forget them as many gave the ultimate sacrifice , their lives so that we may live in freedom today . 

for this i thank them and for steve spielberg for making a movie that i will never forget . 

the academy will not forget tom hanks come april 1999 , as another well deserved oscar with be in tom's posession .

"ingredients : lost parrot trying to get home , friends 

synopsis : a russian janitor named misha ( tony shalhoub ) discovers a little old parrot languishing in the basement of a science research facility . 

 "" paulie the talking parrot "" ( the voice of jay mohr ) soon regales misha with his life story . 

as a young bird paulie is raised by marie ( hallie kate eisenberg ) , a little girl with a speech impediment . 

by attending marie's speech lessons , paulie learns to act/speak like a regular person . 

unfortunately , after being unfairly blamed for an accident , paulie is taken to a pawn shop and sold . 

paulie's biggest wish is to return to marie . 

many years later , and after a succession of memorable owners ( gena rowlands , cheech marin , and jay mohr ) , paulie falls in with a bad crowd and is apprehended in los angeles trying to steal jewelry . 

he is sent to a cruel research facility , where he refuses to participate and is imprisoned the basement . 

will misha help paulie get back to marie ? 

opinion : every time people watch movies that portray animals as beings with cute human personalities , some well-meaning audience members go out next christmas or birthday and buy a dalmatian or whatever creature is currently popular . 

soon enough , "" birthday kid "" loses interest and the purchased pup ends up at the local pound , a victim of neglect . 

my sister owns a real paulie : it thinks like a parrot , bites like a parrot , and requires as much attention as a newborn human infant . 

please think twice before buying one . 

okay . back to the story . 

in movies , parrots usually play support characters , but paulie might be the first movie where the ( animatronic ) bird gets main billing . 

paulie , like those side characters in disney cartoons , is cute and sassy , a strutting , miniature human . 

actually , paulie is the voice of jay mohr ( he played jennifer aniston's boyfriend on picture perfect ) doing his best buddy hackett impression ( which is interesting , since hackett himself cameos as the pawn shop owner , and mohr doubles as a customer ) . 

paulie is for kids . 

while watching paulie you hear little tykes in the theater laughing hysterically when paulie calls the cat a "" stupid furball . "" 

sometimes , however , there are statements the kids don't get . 

for example , when paulie's elderly owner ivy ( gena rowlands ) dies , paulie explains , "" well , one day , the cat got her . "" 

and you hear kids exclaim , "" what cat ? ! "" 

imagine lassie come home , except with a doll-sized human dressed as a bird , and you'll have a good idea of the plot and characterization . 

bird tries to get home . 

bird meets elderly friend . 

bird loses elderly friend . 

bird meets eccentric friend . 

bird loses eccentric friend . 

bird meets bad influence . 

and so on and so forth , with paulie meeting friends and saying goodbye at a meandering pace until he finally makes it back to marie ( trini alvarado ) . 

the bottom line ? 

break out the popcorn money , moms and dads . 

paulie may be the low end version of lassie , bambi , or babe , but he'll do . 

sometimes the wisecracks go over their heads , but i'm sure youngsters can appreciate a story about a little person ( paulie ) trying to get home , meeting friends and experiencing moral lessons on the way . 

and good luck explaining what it means when paulie says of ivy , "" well , one day , the cat got her . ""

"screen story by kevin yagher and andrew kevin walker . 

screenplay by andrew kevin walker . 

inspired by the short story the legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving . 

directed by tim burton . 

starring johnny depp , christina ricci , and casper van dien . 

special appearances by christopher lee and christopher walken . 

synopsis : investigator ichabod crane journeys to 1799 sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation . 

townspeople believe the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them . 

cute blonde katrina and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery . 

comments : tim burton has directed a number of entertaining and groundbreaking films over the years . 

batman , of course , is perhaps his best-known film and led to a string of less successful sequels . 

he's done biographical work ( on the director ed wood ) , children's movies ( nightmare before christmas ) , and a homage to alien invasion movies ( mars attacks ! ) . 

sleepy hollow , his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while , shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies . 

sleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s and 1960s , especially hammer studios' reworkings of dracula and frankenstein , and american international's series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe . 

christopher lee , in fact , star of many hammer productions over the years , appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders . 

the movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s . 

one of the climatic scenes involves a windmill and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein . 

i mention these allusions for a reason . 

seasoned horror film fans , including myself , will smile at their inclusion in this film . 

with the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies , especially the blair witch project ( the most overblown turkey of the decade ) , we needed a film like this . 

not only does it have a sense of history , but burton's skillful use of setting and mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror . 

the film's eerie landscapes and foggy towns , indeed , overshadow the actors and the plot as the most noteworthy aspect of the movie . 

johnny depp , a veteran tim burton actor who has appeared both in ed wood and edward scissorhands , plays ichabod crane , who has apparently changed occupations from irving's original story and is now an investigator . 

depp is adequate in his role . 

no more ; no less . 

equally adequate is christina ricci , who plays the love interest in the film . 

she's a good witch too . 

how cute . 

one of the few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden and cliched dialogue between the main characters . 

the two actors , however , carry the movie well enough , but the supporting cast is what makes this movie shine . 

veteran actors such as jeffrey jones and michael gough ( who played the butler alfred in all four recent batman flicks ) are terrific as the aging townsfolk involved in the conspiracy which depp uncovers . 

while i do not wish to reveal crucial plot points , i can say that the storyline becomes quite confusing . 

you have to pay attention . 

andrew kevin walker wrote the screenplay . 

he's the one who also wrote 8 mm and seven . 

walker is quickly becoming one of the premiere suspense writers in hollywood , and sleepy hollow certainly doesn't hurt his growing reputation . 

as one might imagine from a gentleman like walker , sleepy hollow is quite graphic . 

there's a lot of blood and a lot of beheadings . 

this is definately not a flick to take the young kids to . 

a lady in front of us took her two young sons to see it and spent about 25 - 30 minutes covering the youngest's eyes with her hand . 

he was obviously upset by the movie's intense violence . 

if you're looking for a good scare , however , sleepy hollow is definately recommended . 
"
"well i guess it's that time of the year again . 

the one time of the year where movie craftors are exonerated from the need to even * try * writing a script that has more dialogue than explosions . 

it's also the best time for the handful of existing bigtime hollywood mr action heroes to dust off their miniscule vocabularies , pull on their black vests and charge onto our screens tersely expirating what they hope will become memorable catchphrases . 

in america they call this time "" summer "" and it happens once every year . 

and maybe it's the exposure to all that nasty sun that does it , but in the process normally weak , insipid lines like "" consider this a divorce , "" "" hasta la vista , baby , "" and "" you're the disease . 

i'm the cure "" actually do end up being repeated more often then the phrases from my book of biblical proverbs . 

this is not entirely a bad thing , of course . 

what am i talking about ? 

i'm talking about the summer "" blockbusters , "" the "" action thrillers , "" the "" this-obviously-cost-a-lot-so-you-know- everyone's-going-to-go "" explosions , gas threats , flying saucers , and special effects . 

in the rash of "" my , what big guns you have , but wait ! 

mine are bigger "" movies , there are also the usual boy-meets-fish-and-saves-environment movies ( or whale , whatever ) , and * this * year , the odd crop of "" save-the-world-from-aliens-or-environment- threats "" offerings . 

i'm talking about the three batmans , the speeds , the terminators , etc . this year i'm talking about twister , independence day , the arrival , the rock , mission : impossible , and of course , eraser . 

here in singapore , as our local movie critics like to whine , we seem to get the pick of the crop of "" my explosion is more real-looking than yours "" movies , but nothing else . 

mission : impossible opened in our theatres almost as soon as it did in the us . 

the same goes for eraser , which is unfortunate for arnold schwarzenegger because coming so soon after what time magazine recently called "" mission : unavoidable "" ( on account of its worldwide mega-advertising blitz ) , eraser seems like a cheaper , less thoughtful imitation . 

that's saying a lot , because mi the movie was already a cheap , thoughtless imitation of its tv originator of the '60s/'70s . 

in eraser , arnie is a us federal marshall who relocates trial witnesses whose testimonies place their lives in danger . 

he does this by destroying all evidence of their present existence and re-situating them with new identities . 

his new case is lee cullen , played by vanessa williams who , unlike all the other scumbags he's ever relocated , is "" an actual , real life honest person . "" 

because she's so good , and has such nice legs , arnold spends the whole movie trying to protect her , and only uses the opening movie sequence to save robert pastorelli from * his * killers . 

lee obtains evidence that the high-technology weapons company she works for is secretly selling sophisticated , black-market arms to people with foreign accents and stringy hair . 

of course , as the formula goes , her revealing this information will destroy the system as we know it because heck , there are people in high places who will go down with this , because yes , this is the biggest conspiracy in the history of the world ( that is , america ) since watergate . 

in protecting lee , arnold is framed by the mentor-turned-evil robert deguerin , nicely played by james caan , and ends up having to prove that he isn't the one killing the programme's witnesses in addition to making sure lee isn't accidentally torpedo-ed to death by the new , green guns his enemies all have . 

it's around this time that people in the theatre with me starting humming the mission : impossible theme , because arnie's mission includes breaking into a high-security building to run a disk . 

i guess i should tell you more about the particular gun everyone in this movie is so antsy about . 

it's an electro-magnetic pulse gun thing which fires aluminium missiles , and which can see through walls . 

it has some sort of x-ray vision , so its user can target the victim's heart even from great distances . 

despite this , which i figure is a pretty cool feature in a gun ( though i'm certainly no expert ) , however , arnold , whose own heart is targeted a number of times , * never * goes flying 10 feet backwards with a two-foot missile through his chest like all the others who get shot by this gun . 

instead he outruns and outsmarts his trackers each time , giving eery and ironic resonance to that terminator line that practically made him famous : "" i'll be back . "" 

like everyone else in the theater , i left the movie feeling that the trailers had duped me , because they made me want to watch this movie voluntarily . 

although there is a * lot * of violence in this movie , not to mention mutilation and some bloody tussles with alligators , i recommend this movie to most over-18s who need some therapeutic mindless action to get over the weirdness of fargo or the hangover effect of leaving las vegas . 

review's rating system : * wait for the video . 

 * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! 

 * * * pretty good , bring a friend . 

 * * * * amazing , potent stuff . 

 * * * * * perfection . 

see it twice .

"capsule : combine one quart of raiders of the lost ark , a dash of a jackie chan movie ( sans jackie ) , two teaspoons of gun- and swordplay , and a dollop of cgi . 

simmer for 100 minutes . 

yields : zilch . 

the phantom is a depressing and tired retread of so many earlier , better movies that after the fifteen-minute mark i started cataloguing them out loud . 

it's hard to make a good action-adventure movie that doesn't simply recycle its predecessors , and i've seen movies that even at least did the recycling gracefully . 

the phantom , allegedly based on the long-running comic of the same name , doesn't even bother to be graceful . 

it's a stupid and incompetent movie in too many ways to list , but i'll try . 

the film opens up with a "" prelude "" sequence that looks like it was slashed to ribbons in the editing and then given a heavy voice-over to compensate for whatever got thrown out . 

we go from there to a jungle sequence that , i swear to god , recycles the truck-chase scene from raiders of the lost ark note-for-note , possibly even shot-for-shot , right down to the moment where indy wrenched open the door and slung one of the drivers out into the brush -- and then goes on to rip off the rope-bridge scene from "" sorcerer "" as well ! 

sorcerer , as you may well remember , was a remake of a french movie , the wages of fear , in which a bunch of lowlifes were paid piles of money to drive a truck loaded with nitro through horrible jungle terrain . 

both versions of that movie were far more interesting than this flick , but i've got my job to do , so back to the salt mines we go . 

anyway , the cinematic theft doesn't stop there . 

or at least the lack of inspiration . 

there isn't a single thing here we haven't seen , and it's not given to us in a way that remotely evokes our interest . 

we have ( where's my list ? ) 

a bad girl , a tough good girl , a secret cave hideaway ( which seems inspired more by dr . 

no than anything else ) , a boardroom meeting that drips with greed and venality , magical artifacts of terrible power , and cary-hiroyuki tagawa wasted in another stupid role where he gets to wear a fu manchu mustache and sneer a lot and generally humiliate himself . 

what else is there ? 

the plot is a waste of time . 

the sets alternate between big but hokey -- and tiny and still hokey . 

there are lines in the script that are just begging to be mst3ked -- and i'm sure once mike and the 'bots get the cash , they'll stick it on their sked . 

the only thing in the movie worth noting is billy zane -- he's a good actor , and he tries very hard , even when the script is sending him down one dead alley of a scene after another . 

all i can say is that i pray this isn't the beginning of the end for him -- although it sure looks like the final nail in the coffin for the comic-book super-hero movie . 
"
"weir is well-respected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject-matter into deceptively simple , powerful films , the mosquito coast ( utopia ) and fearless ( post-traumatic stress disorder ) among them . 

in the truman show , weir essentially breathes life into the now-tired concept of media-manipulation by tackling the material from the inside-out . 

it certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in top-form playing the title character , truman burbank . 

by now you must be aware of the premise : unbeknownst to him , truman ( carrey ) is the star of his own tv series , a 24-7 peep-show in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations ; people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants . 

`seahaven' , his hometown , and the show itself , are the brainchild of christof ( harris ) , who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon , directing over 500 cameras and hundreds of actors and extras . 

for 30 years , truman suspects nothing-`we accept the reality we're given , ' poses christof-but a desire to break free of the sunny town and visit a long lost love in `fiji' ( mcelhone , who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break the confidentiality agreement ) overwhelms him . 

thus , christof and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of seahaven intact , lest truman discover the world outside and put an end to the highly-rated program . 

in a few broad strokes , weir creates a convincing second-reality , and he has the good sense not to bring christof into the picture until almost three-quarters through . 

this allows us to comprehend and accept truman's world before we contextualize it . 

for all his madness , christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship , and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it . 

truman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be , well , so darn nice ; like a sibling ( or , perhaps more appropriately , a caged animal in an interactive zoo ) , they want to see him succeed . 

the surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to a tight screenplay and a sympathetic carrey-he really is an everyman here , abandoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible , wide-eyed bewilderment . 

cinematically , the truman show is impeccable , stylishly photographed by peter biziou and littered with symbolic images . 

as well , it employs wojciech kilar's piece "" zycie za zycie' masterfully and beautifully . 

if the film has any flaws , one may find them in laura linney's characterization as meryl , truman's "" wife "" ( i doubt that betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone ) , and in a subplot involving truman's `father' , which feels curiously incomplete . 

there are a few stupendous sequences , and the film pulls off a wonderful trick : we become truman's audience as much as the loyal viewers in the film . 

they wear buttons asking `how will it end ? ' 

i couldn't wait to know myself , though i didn't exactly want it to end , for this inspired movie is possibly the best-and most complex-summer picture in years . 
"
"_dirty_work_ has a premise of deliciously mean-spirited potential . 

mitch weaver ( norm macdonald ) and his lifelong best friend sam mckenna ( artie lange ) are losers in life : they were constantly picked on in school , and now they cannot hold regular jobs . 

but as the trailer goes , "" there is one thing mitch weaver is good at--revenge . "" 

so he and sam parlay their unmatched skill in getting-even schemes into a marketable revenge-for-hire business called dirty work inc . 

this should be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked black comedy , but for a film called _dirty_work_ , what ensues is rather clean of spirit . 

in fact , what makes mitch and sam start up their business is not a giddy desire to give bullies a taste of their own medicine , but rather a more sappy reason : sam's father ( jack warden ) needs a heart transplant , and in order for him to move at the top of the recipient list , his compulsively betting doctor ( chevy chase ) asks the guys for $50 , 000 to pay off his bookie . 

so for all the scheming that goes on , beneath every underhanded plot is--gasp ! --a 

heart , which undercuts the inherent nastiness of the premise . 

not that there isn't a lot of nastiness on display--there is , but of a different sort . 

there are frequent sexual references , most prominently in the form of prostitutes and sam's impotent father's ongoing lust for them . 

and for a film rated pg-13 , director bob saget ( yes , that bob saget , of _full_house_ and _america's_funniest_home_videos_ fame ) and writers frank sebastiano , fred wolf , and macdonald himself , stretch the boundaries of good taste rather far--arguably a bit too much so ( was not one , but two separate instances of sodomy between animals really necessary ? ) . 

but the issue , of course , is not so much of taste as it is humor--as in , is it funny or not ? 

the answer is a resounding no . 

it's not that macdonald isn't a funny guy . 

he was one of the more consistently funny performers on _saturday_night_live_ before his much-talked-about firing , and his dry brand of smartass wit translates well to the big screen ; it also doesn't hurt that he's a natural , likable screen presence . 

he is able to give some of his lines a nice acid touch , but , for the most part , the oneliners , as written , are flat , and the broad slapstick gags just don't work ( one running gag has him being literally tossed out of buildings--a real riot ) . 

still , macdonald's few shining moments are just about the only moments the film has . 

the late chris farley , as hysterical as he ever was , is amusing in a cameo role , but , as a whole , the supporting players are amateurish and seemingly free from any directorial guidance . 

saget tries to juice up the proceedings with kitschy cameos by gary coleman , adam sandler , and john goodman , but their minimal novelty value cannot prevent _dirty_work_ from sputtering to the end of its brief 81-minute running time . 

the film closes on a sad note of desperation , an indulgent reel of outtakes from which only those involved in the production would derive any amusement . 

come to think of it , i cannot imagine anyone but those involved in the production to find much amusement in the entirety of _dirty_work_ .

"kadosh means sacred in hebrew . 

amos gitai's fictional work , after spending most of his career doing documentaries , is a grim story about a failed hasidic marriage , even though the marriage is a loving one . 

the marriage will symbolize the clash of cultures in modern israel between the native israeli's modern viewpoint toward religion and the political savvy hasidic's intolerable one , as both groups are vying for control of the secular government . 

gitai ( devarim/yom yom ) is a labor party leftist , who believes that if the rigid hasidic ever got control of the government , it would sound the death knell of israel . 

the emphasis of the film is on how the ultra-orthodox jews of that sect live by the letter of the torah in everything they do and how they subjugate the women to accept their vision of god's law from only the male's view . 

that if they ever got control of the country , their intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women are . 

the story takes place in jerusalem's jewish quarters called mea shearim , where we are taken down sinewy back streets with placards pasted on the walls , and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the protagonists live out their idea of the proper jewish life , which is much different than the way most jews live in israel . 

this is a controversial film , in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones , that the film is bound to anger most viewers , no matter their belief . 

it is a slow-moving , meticulous film , that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go . 

the force of what is seen , though filmed in an objective manner , never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim , is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance . 

the film is meant to be critical of such a rigid people , as it implies how they kill the spirit of everything they touch and with their extreme phobic attitudes , it makes it impossible for them to unite the country when they can't at present live in harmony with their own people , and it would be even more impossible to imagine them living with their arab neighbors in peace . 

the film opens as meir rises at dawn and goes through his prayer ritual , where every prayer is made to the virtues of god . 

he even thanks god that he didn't make him a woman . 

his wife rivka accepts the fate she was born into and looks at him from the next bed where she sleeps separately according to hasidic custom . 

she looks at him with glistening eyes , not questioning the laws or rebelling against her secondary role and how her religion keeps her from studying the talmud and having all the modern conveniences of life , and from seeing movies and tv . 

meir is a talmudic scholar . 

his father ( abu warda ) is a rabbi at the yeshiva . 

he has been married for ten years and his wife has not been able to give him a child . 

since the hasidim look upon a woman's role in life being only to conceive children , and cook and clean house for the man , while the man's role is to spend his time in prayer , therefore there is an insurmountable problem in this otherwise loving marriage . 

she receives an anonymous letter that states "" a woman without a child is no better than dead . "" 

meir's response , is that it is written like that in the talmud . 

meir's father tells him that the marriage contract must be broken : "" a man who dies without progeny rips a page from the torah . "" 

all the blame is placed on rivka , who is thought of as unpure as the reason for her being barren . 

she will go through countless ritual baths to cleanse herself , as her rigid mother ( koenig ) dunks her in the holy water and says a ritual prayer for the 12 times she is dunked as an homage to the 12 tribes of israel . 

their religion doesn't permit them to be examined extensively by a doctor . 

rivka goes on the sly and finds out that it is her husband who is sterile , but she cannot tell him that because of their religion . 

so when meir's father chooses a younger woman for his son , she is exiled to live alone in a cold apartment in the same jewish quarters . 

rivka's spirited younger sister malka does not want to get married but wants to live a more liberated life . 

she has a long time romantic relationship with a fellow hasidic yaakov . 

but , because of the way they were both raised , she is still a virgin . 

when yaakov joined the israeli army to fight in lebanon , something his sect is not allowed to do , he is thereby banished from the sect even though he is still a believer . 

he now works as a singer in a nightclub . 

malka's mother is worried that her daughter won't get married , so she arranges with the rabbi for her to marry yossef , someone whom she doesn't love . 

yossef is a very stern follower of the order , he is also a political activist who drives around the city in a sound-truck with a bull-horn urging jews to stick together and fight their godless enemies . 

the two sisters are close and languidly discuss their options , with rivka telling her sister to accept the marriage , it will make her happy ; but , while malka is reluctantly forced into accepting it , she has other plans to ruin this bogus marriage . 

the harshest scene in the film is on malka's wedding night . 

yossef prays to god for a child and then robotically gets malka to spread her legs , and without the least bit of affection , only a nervousness shown on his part for the function he supplies , as he goes inside her and rams her hard , thrusting away until the act is completed and then retiring without a word or gesture of love . 

the sisters have choices , like everyone else in life does . 

but the choices are obliterated by one's beliefs , circumstances , and inward nature , and how difficult it is to carry out those choices if it goes completely against the way one is brought up . 

for the sisters , the choices are life or death ones . 

gitai by closing in on the daily rituals , tight living quarters and close-knit community , has shown how difficult these choices are for those who have never seen another world and have been kept in the dark all their life . 

the film ends with the forlorn malka walking atop of jerusalem and looking down upon it as an outsider would , and everything seems strange to her , all the things she once thought of as being set in stone are now harsh memories , as she has made her choice , and the price of that choice is very heavy indeed .

"robin williams has the rarest of gifts : the ability to rise above the most inept material and suffuse it with his irreverent style . 

overwhelmingly , his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst and enjoyable at best ( with the notable exception of flubber ) . 

so when i , the one person who has refused to abandon him despite patch adams , tell you that not even williams can save his latest project , you know it's in trouble . 

jakob the liar is a confused , muddled little movie ; a generically "" uplifting "" film with a fundamental contradiction : the message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie doesn't realize it . 

williams plays jakob haim , a jew imprisoned in a polish ghetto during world war ii . 

one night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly sent to the office of a high-ranking german officer for his punishment . 

jakob gets off easy and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds of a radio broadcast . 

the announcement ( in english , but punctuated by a triumphant "" heil hitler ! "" ) is that russian troops are only miles away from jakob's ghetto . 

liberation ! he thinks . 

the next day , jakob tells the news to his closest friend , a volatile prize fighter named misha ( liev schreiber ) , who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along . 

soon , it is a common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has a radio hidden in his home -- a crime punishable by death . 

this is absurdly false , but the more jakob tells the people of the ghetto this , the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is to decide their fate . 

the danger , of course , is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto , and rumors about the radio can get out and put jakob in great danger . 

in a curiously irrelevant subplot , jakob finds a 11-year old girl who has separated from her parents and decides to hide her in his small home . 

apparently he is afraid that she will be discovered , and goes to great length to make sure of that -- just why the idea frightens him is never made clear . 

he and the girl build an uninvolving , generic relationship that never goes anywhere and is as irrelevant at the end as it was in the beginning . 

the moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine . 

but jakob the liar forgets that the hope that jakob brings to his ghetto is false . 

such hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization and when those expectations aren't met , the results are far worse than if there was no hope . 

that's the film's biggest detriment : it is based on a false assumption and thus comes off as painfully false . 

it's never moving because it doesn't give us anything to be moved by . 

jakob the liar fails to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for existing . 

robin williams doesn't inject the film with life , as a matter of fact , he seems a little out of it , as if crippled by his fake accent . 

he is stragely unenthusiastic ; his character is one who spreads hope but his performance is lifeless , hopeless . 

not since good will hunting has he abandoned his signature style to this extent ; this isn't the robin williams we know and love . 

in good will hunting he became a serious actor and won an oscar for it . 

here , he is more of a wannabe serious actor ; an impostor . 

jakob the liar will be compared with last year's life is beautiful because it is being marketed as a "" holocaust comedy "" . 

it's not a comedy . 

it tries , sometimes , but it rarely works . 

is it a melodrama ? 

a war movie ? 

a character study ? 

no , no , and no . 

jakob the liar is the kind of movie that can't be placed into a category ; not because it covers so many different genres but because it fails at just about every one it attempts .

"time bandits , from director terry gilliam , is a very different fantasy action/adventure movie about a group of time-traveling dwarves , led by randall ( david rappaport ) , who have stolen a map of the universe . 

this map contains time hole , that , if exploited , enable the men to travel back and forth through time . 

the supreme being of the universe ( ralph richardson ) is the former employer of these treasure-seeking bandits , and he wishes desperately to regain the map . . 

during the travels , he appears as a ghostly face , demanding that they return the map that they have stolen . 

but , according to randall , they are just "" borrowing "" it . 

kevin , a young boy who seems quite bored with his life , is unexpectedly brought into the schemes of the little men when they appear in his room , which has a portal for time traveling . 

he joins up with the men and becomes part of their gang , following them on their robberies . 

their first victim is napoleon ( ian holm ) , whom they rob during a battle that he is commanding . 

from here , the group travels to the middle ages , meeting up with robin hood himself . 

eventually , kevin is separated from the group and travels to an egyptian time where he is taken in by king agamemnon , played by sean connery . 

kevin accidentally saved the king's life , and the king wishes to have kevin as his son . 

but the group of bandits find kevin and transport onto the deck of the titanic . 

meanwhile , the evil genius ( david warner ) is watching the group from fortress of ultimate darkness , attempting to find a way in order to bring the men , and the map , to him . 

when randall learns of the fortress of ultimate darkness , which supposedly contains "" the most fabulous object in the world "" , the dollar signs seemingly appear on his eyes , as he is convinced that they must travel there . 

once inside the fortress of ultimate darkness , it is unclear as to if any of the men will make it out alive . 

time bandits is a fantastically made film that caters to the imagination of anyone . 

with a terrific soundtrack , courtesy of george harrison , whom also was an executive producer , time bandits is sure to be a very surrealistic , time-traveling adventure with unforgettable characters that is sure to entertain anyone . 

terry gilliam , however , does not utilize that greatly his trademark ability in moviemaking during this film , although this does not affect the film that greatly . 

and finally , if you liked labyrinth , you'll love time bandits .

"your first clue that something isn't gonna be quite right with the movie you're about to see : it's heavily christmas-themed and its release date is , oh , say , at the end of february . 

your second clue that something isn't gonna be quite right with the movie you're about to see : charlize theron , one of the movie's dubious stars , makes an appearance on the daily show in which , when asked if her new movie's any good , she replies with the equivalent of a verbal sigh . . . 

assuring us that , yeah , it sure is a movie , all right ! 

and there's some scenes like those you'd expect to find in a movie , and there's some action . . . 

and there's other . . . 

stuff . . . 

too . 

how to immediately grab my attention : open your movie with five dead guys in santa claus suits . 

then show a caption reading "" six days earlier . . . "" 

ya know , i was honestly interested to find out what killed all those poor santas . . . 

how to immediately lose my attention : follow your opening scene with a terminally dull nice-guys-who-don't-deserve-to-be-in-prison scene . 

write a line for the one of prisoners like "" i just want to go home and eat christmas dinner and watch some ball with my dad . "" 

then , have ben affleck actually say that line , on film , and forget to leave it on the cutting room floor . 

for good measure , throw in a poorly motivated prison riot and have affleck's best buddy stabbed . . . 

aw . . . 

and just two days before his release , too . 

already the cliches are piled on thick , and when it rains , it pours . 

how to take my attention , dash it violently against the rocks , and make it so that i'm contemplating my strategy for calling "" shotgun "" about an hour before i know the credits will roll : deny your characters the ability to think . 

have ben affleck , for some reason i'll never understand , pretend he's his dead prison buddy so that he can get his girlfriend , played by charlize theron . 

have gary sinise show up and force the two of them to participate in a poorly planned casino heist . 

the villains' big idea ? 

kidnap affleck because he used to be a security guard at the casino , force him to tell you where all the doors in the place are , then dress up in santa suits , create some "" diversions "" and rob the place . 

on paper , it seems like the stuff of a potential caper comedy , but veteran director john frankenheimer wrongly picks up that piece of paper and thinks he's looking at the makings for some sort of clever action-crime thriller . 

it's not like the man isn't capable . . . 

far from it . 

he's the man responsible for classic political thrillers like the manchurian candidate and seven days in may . 

he wowed me with some the most memorable car chases i've ever seen in last year's ronin . 

but he's certainly guilty of churning out some certifiable losers . . . 

put reindeer games on the shelf of shame with his 1996 version of the island of dr . moreau . 

step one in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible : cast ben affleck in the role of the world's most generic hero . 

he gets no good one-liners , he doesn't get to shoot or implode anything in new and interesting ways , and all we know about him is that he regrets his past as a car thief and wants a cup of hot chocolate and piece of pecan pie . 

his name is rudy ( short for rudolph , in all likelihood . 

see , it's called reindeer games . 

get it ? 

get it ? 

shut up . ) 

in the past , affleck has been at his best as a supporting actor , and reindeer games does nothing to further his viability as a leading man . 

step two in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible : gary sinise's villain dresses and looks like the most standard movie crook a filmmaker could have some up with . 

he's dirty and potty-mouthed , he's got long , scruffy hair and a goatee , and i fully expected him to walk out of the casino carrying sacks with giant dollar signs on them . 

he's also extremely inept at what he does . 

he thinks garish cowboy costumes and santa suits make acceptable disguises , and he trusts affleck's character to pull through even after , time and time and time again , he tricks him and lies to him and nearly kills him . 

but instead of tapping into the comic possibilities of this role , sinise seems to think he's playing some sort of tough , smart , and smooth criminal mastermind , rather than the complete moron that was obviously written into the script . 

[on a side note , gary sinise wins this week's "" title ! "" 

award , as he's the one who gets to awkwardly cram the name of the movie into one of his lines early in the proceedings . 

last week's winner was natasha henstridge for the whole nine yards . ] 

how to take your bad idea and make things worse : include two or three plot twists that , instead of making the apparently stupidity of the plan seem suddenly intelligent , make the plan seem even more ridiculous and unlikely . 

this is a bad movie . 

and what's worse is that , except for a few moments near the not-so-stunning conclusion as the preposterous is replaced by the ludicrously preposterous , reindeer games never really gives us the satisfaction of being laughably bad . 

if they'd done that much , at least i would have been entertained .

"jackie chan kicks his way into van damme territory with twin dragons , an embarrassingly bland action comedy of mistaken identities . 

chan plays separated-at-births boomer and john ma , whose drastically different paths . . . 

aw , forget the plot description , it's not even worth the space . 

but let's face it . 

no one goes to jackie chan movies for the plot anyway . 

the scenes where nothing happens in chan's films have always been little more than glue thriftily spread to hold the action sequences together . 

in the case of twin dragons , however , the tiresome plot-driving scenes fritter away so much of the movie that you almost want to shout ( at the risk of demeaning the artistic value of cinema ) , "" get to the good part already ! "" 

most of the film is devoted to showing the brothers' efforts to hide the other's existence from their own acquaintances . 

why it is necessary to do this is not satisfactorily explained , but neither are a lot of aspects of the plot . 

the twins' love interests , demure club-singer barbara ( chan-film regular maggie cheung ) and lusty bride-hopeful tammy ( nina li chi ) , get disoriented in all the brouhaha , yet strangely seem not to mind that they are not sure which brother they are in love with . 

the scenes describing the boys' bumbling antics get stretched so thin we stop caring who chan is supposed to be in any given shot ( in several shots , in fact , even the make-up and hair people seem to forget which brother is which . ) . 

even chan's so-corny-it's-funny humor is off-kilter in this outing . 

some of the gags are so carefully innocuous they're annoying . 

a case in point : whenever anyone sees the brothers together , they fall to the ground in a dead faint . 

are we laughing yet ? 

as usual , the final showdown is the film's jewel , a tour de force display of chan' s agility and grace . 

never mind that it's not clear how the brothers end up fighting suited bad guys inside an automobile crash-testing facility . 

it's all good fun , but too little too late . 

perhaps chan's next movie should just be a collection of the last fight sequences of all of his movies . 

they could call it jackie chan's the final fight scenes , and everybody would go home happy .

"in the opening shot of midnight cowboy , we see a close-up of a blank movie screen at a drive-in . 

we hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses' hooves . 

without an image projected onto the screen , the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our mind's eye . 

even without having seen a cowboys and indians movie , somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema . 

but do cowboys really exist , or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper ? 

exploring this theme , director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream , an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept . 

is the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend ? 

midnight cowboy suggests that the american dream , like image of the cowboy , is merely a myth . 

as joe buck migrates from place to place , he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself , only further degeneration . 

during the opening credits , joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads `john wayne : the alamo . ' 

as joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show , a lady on the air describes her ideal man as `gary cooper ? but he's dead . ' 

a troubled expression comes across joe's face , as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone . 

having adopted the image of a cowboy since youth , joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody . 

joe's persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream . 

he romanticizes about making it in the big city , but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance . 

by the end of midnight cowboy , joe buck loses everything and gains nothing . 

just as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen , we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success . 

but how realistic are these ideals ? 

joe had raped and been raped in texas . 

the scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york , but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas . 

alongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation . 

the ability to pack up one's belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention . 

schlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joe's abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny . 

we understand that joe adopts the fa ? ade of a cowboy , a symbol of virility and gallantry , as an attempt to neutralize his shame . 

he runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york . 

in the scene at the diner which foreshadows joe's encounter with the gay student , joe buck spills ketchup on himself . 

standing up , we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh . 

schlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joe's virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals , signifying emasculation . 

beyond the symbol of castration , the scene may also connote the bleeding of a virgin's first sexual encounter , a reference to joe's first homosexual liaison . 

the fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joe's emasculation . 

it is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients , but effortlessly attracts men . 

joe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity ; new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and `faggot stuff . ' 

there are two predominant images of new york . 

the first is that new york is the rich , cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized by the tall skyscrapers and the statue of liberty . 

the other new york is travis bickle's new york , a seedy , corruptive hell on earth . 

joe envisions new york as the former , but is presented with the latter . 

mirroring the irony in which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine , he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled with lonely women neglected by gay men . 

joe thinks he is performing a great service for new york , but the city rapes him of his pride and possessions . 

the people steal joe's money , the landlord confiscates his luggage , and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity . 

what has become of joe's american dream ? 

schlesinger responds to this question with the scene at the party . 

joe gets invited to a shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food , drugs , and sex . 

at the party , all of joe and ratzo's desires are made flesh ; joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads up on free salami . 

contrasting joe's daily struggles , shots of warhol's crew display wanton indulgence . 

there is an irreverence in the partygoers' attitude ; we see a shot of a woman kowtowing to nothing in particular , orgies breaking out in the periphery , and drugs passed around like party favors . 

the party makes a mockery of joe' s ideals . 

joe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success in america ; scenes of the party and his rendezvous with shirley suggest that it is the idle who profit from joe's toils . 

the american dream , schlesinger suggests , is merely a proletarian fantasy , for those who are content no longer dream , but become indolent . 

as joe heads to miami , all that was significant of the cowboy image has left him . 

his masculinity is compromised and his morality is relinquished . 

for joe , nothing is left of the cowboy hero and commensurately , he surrenders the identity . 

tossing his boots into the garbage , he returns to the bus for the last leg of his journey to miami . 

the final shot of midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus , more introspective , taking only a few glances outside the window . 

instead of the frequent pov shots of joe excitedly looking out of the bus on his way to new york , schlesinger sets up this final shot from the exterior of the bus looking in through the window at joe . 

reflections of the palm trees ratzo so raved about run across the bus' window with joe hardly taking notice . 

the scenery of miami no longer exacts the same excitement from joe as before . 

the world seems smaller to joe now ; the termination of his journey coincides with the termination of his american dream . 

no longer does joe aspire to be the enterprising gigolo ; he resolves to return to a normal job and resign to basic means . 

midnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations of the american dream . 

there is the frontier fantasy that if you are brave enough to repel a few indians , you can set up a ranch out west and raise a beautiful family . 

then there is the jay gatsby dream that a man of humble stock , with perseverance , can make a fortune in the big city . 

joe's attempt to realize these dreams robs him of his innocence in texas and morality in new york . 

during his search for an intangible paradise , joe ends up raping a girl and killing a man . 

an allegory of chasing the promise of the american dream , joe buck's progressive moral atrophy is a warning against the pursuit of illusory icons .

"if the 70's nostalgia didn't make you feel old , the 80's nostalgia is bound to . 

one of the latter set , "" the wedding singer , "" seems to be written by someone who did not experience the 1980's directly but only read about them in an article in parade magazine . 

the wacky fashions are here . 

 . 

 . 

and the music . 

 . 

 . 

and references aplenty to celebrities and signs of the times , but it all seems tediously-and too obviously-inserted for the didn't-we-dress-funny-back-then chuckle . 

the plot is standard romantic comedy with nothing original : robbie ( adam sandler ) is a wedding singer ; julia ( drew barrymore ) waits tables at weddings . 

both are engaged ; however , robbie's fiance ( angela featherstone ) dumps him at the altar , and julia's fiance ( matthew glave ) is a skirt-chasing speculator in junk bonds . 

robbie and julia go through the expected ups-and-downs as they realize they were meant to be together . 

i'll fess up-i've never found adam sandler funny . 

whatever his appeal is , i've missed it . 

 ( other comedians i don't get include pauly shore and pee wee herman-make your own judgments ) . 

the stupidity and artificiality of the whole project is summarized in a cameo by billy idol as himself . 

idol looks like hell , and the ravages of his lifestyle are barely concealed by thick makeup . 

he's mocked by a photo of his younger self on a rolling stone cover in the same scene . 

we're not supposed to notice that , and we're not supposed to notice how silly it is that billy idol suddenly appears to play fairy godmother to robbie . 

other cameos , by steve buscemi and jon lovitz , provide the only real laughs in the movie . 

lovitz is especially good , playing a rival wedding singer plotting with the mania of a bond villain to take advantage of robbie's post-break-up depression . 
"
" "" ladybugs "" is a typical comedy that relies on three supposed guarantees : the pathetic team who beats the champs ; cross dressing ; and the presence of rodney dangerfield . 

this picture doesn't play like a comedy for children , so who is it aimed at ? 

and why is it told like a 91-minute sit-com instead of a feature film ? 

rodney dangerfield stars as chester lee , a total schmuck working at a huge corporation . 

he obviously doesn't have a lot of self esteem and thinks he has to kiss up to get ahead , which he does by volunteering to coach the company's girls' soccer team . 

what a shock to learn chester and his assistant julie ( jackee ) know absolutely nothing about the game , and the players seem to know even less . 

i didn't laugh , but for some reason it didn't annoy me that much . 

chester's fiancee bess ( graff ) thinks he got a promotion in addition to the coaching position , and of course she has a slacker for a son who is doing poorly in school and is kicked off the sports teams . 

jonathon brandis is a nice surprise as matthew , who agrees to dress up as a girl named martha to help out chester ( probably because the girl he has a crush on plays on the team - what original story ideas ! ) . 

what we get is just another retread of the "" underdog sports team "" mixed with some cross dressing . 

unfortunately , the film isn't smart enough to play upon the drag aspect . 

in fact , it downplays it so heavily it's totally unbelievable . 

could it be any more obvious martha is a boy ? 

he only wears a girl's wig , without any makeup , and they don't even give him falsies . 

brandis doesn't bother to mimic a girl's voice either . 

then there is a pointless scene where chester and matthew shop for a dress , but for what reason ? 

martha is only seen on the soccer field , why would they buy a dress for her ? 

just when we think the martha character is going to be useful , she disappears , and the story wanders aimlessly looking for a new plot to pick up on . 

when bess discovers what's really going on she breaks up with chester , and the relationship is forgotten about and the film focuses on the soccer team and the tension between chester and his boss . 

this film could've been less bad had it been the cliche sports comedy , but it feels the need to go off on tangents that are completely unnecessary ( and bad at that ) . 

there's just too much of a sit-com feel here , especially during the so-called serious moments , and all the confusion between the characters . 

i've seen worse movies than "" ladybugs , "" but for some reason it contained some sort of bizarre charm , so even when it turns sour it doesn't seem as bad as it is . 

dangerfield finally gets his respect in the end , but at what a price .

"it is with hesitance that i call "" apocalypse now "" a masterpiece . 

certainly , it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made , with a director known for producing masterpieces with ease , and some of the finest actors of the 1970's . 

the plot , an adaptation of joseph conrad's "" heart of darkness "" , was set in vietnam , and the timing of the film was supposed to be brilliant , coming on the heels of the end of the war . 

 "" apocalypse "" certainly has its moments , some of which are the finest in film history . 

the plot is fairly simple . 

captain willard ( sheen ) , is a troubled soldier who came back to hanoi for a 2nd tour of duty . 

his mission is simple : take a boat up to cambodian territory , and destroy the command of renegade colonel kurtz ( brando ) "" with extreme prejudice "" . 

along the way , willard runs into a series of adventures , including one with lt . col . kilgore ( duvall ) , and a strange encounter with playboy bunnies . 

willard' s four person crew finally make it to kurtz' compound , where he discovers kurtz has set himself up as a god among the natives . 

willard's experiences with kurtz take up the last half-hour , with a confrontation and eventual ending . 

the movie is visually breathtaking . 

the battle scenes are exquisitely done , and the score is brilliant , setting a murky mood of darkness that is first-rate . 

the collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing and sickening . 

the vast amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning , and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire movie . 

the journey to kurtz' camp is quite a ride , with psychosis setting in on almost every character . 

the most interesting one is kilgore , the lt . col . who cares more about the surf than about the mission . 

it is at times revolting , psychotic , and incredible , and it is one hell of a movie . 

the scenes are bold , inventive , and powerful , and the acting is stunning , especially be sheen , duvall , and fishburne . 

the narration is exquisite , as is the mystery of kurtz . 

coppola sets about a hallucinatory ride through vietnam , kind of like "" saving private ryan "" on lsd . 

the film is jarring in its implications , and psychotic in its execution . 

the problems come when the film slows down . 

one of the major scenes in the film , where the boat arrives at the final army checkpoint before they start their search for kurtz , is a colossal mess . 

the dialogue is confusing , the lighting is atrocious , and the scene drags on for 10 terrible minutes of film . 

the true problems happen after the crew does come into the kurtz compound . 

the film slows down to a drag . 

sheen seems forever captured by a madman , played by brando is a lazy performance that is not deserving of the accolades it received . 

brando is in the film for no more than 15 minutes , but is bathed in shadows the entire time , making the last half hour of the film visually pathetic . 

the scenes are poorly done , the dialogue is muffled , and the whole mess is utterly confusing beyond all belief . 

sheen seems to adore this man , but why the viewers are never told . 

the entire journey is supposed to be a prelude for a stunning entrance of this god-like kurtz , but the scenes fall way short of expectations . 

granted , it has its moments , which are brutally horrific , but the general feeling is one of confusion . 

brando mumbles his lines in a incoherent stir , and my feeling was that this could never be a great man , this could never be a man who inspires hundreds to follow him , so why do they do it ? 

there are moments of brilliance , but the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene . 

there are too many questions left unanswered with the character of kurtz to have a satisfying ending . 

the finest scene at the end is sheen's escape , and his entrace into the temple . 

his rise out of the water , with the smoke coming off of his slicked head , is a brilliant 30 seconds of film . 

yet , you cannot shake the feeling that there is so much more this film could have done . 

the psychotic ride is unforgettable at times , and indeed the film on the whole is very good . 

it is a stunningly flawed expression of film , for it addresses major issues , such as man's mental stamina during bouts of war . 

but one still cannot shake the feeling that this film could have so much more powerful , had the character of kurtz been more explored , and had sheen truly succumbed to the fate that the viewer thought he was destined for . 

there is too much good material in here not to be called a masterpiece , but it could have been so much more rewarding .

"capsule : a ham-handed and over/underwritten morality play masquerading as entertainment , so muddled it doesn't even know what it's really advocating , if anything . 

a time to kill has been hailed as the best of the grisham adaptations , and it's easy to see why : it presents a strong , almost rancorously so , story ; it is full of good actors ( samuel l . jackson , matthew mcconaughey , sandra bullock , kevin spacey , charles dutton ) ; and it's ostensibly about some important social issue that we're all tangling with . 

it is not , however , a good movie , and all of the reasons i've listed above have something to do with why . 

right from the beginning , the movie is dead-set on stacking its deck as thoroughly and unrepentantly as possible . 

a pair of redneck whites , boozed and drugged out of their minds , kidnap a young black girl , abuse and rape her horribly , and leave her for dead . 

after their arrest , their father ( jackson ) takes an assault rifle and guns them down on the way to trial . 

mcconaughey is then drafted in as his lawyer , and the rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics . 

the acting is not quite what it should be , given the cast we have . 

sandra bullock ( who is a good actress but not a serious one ) looks clueless ; spacey's accent switches itself on and off at random ( and he's given a totally thankless role to play as well , a role without an iota of depth ) ; and mcconaughey's role is stamped from the cardboard back of a cereal box . 

the most memorable role is donald sutherland's , and his is a bit part . 

i always consider it an index of a movie's desperation when it is able to present shocking and outlandish events , and somehow not have them generate an ounce of impact . 

there is one scene -- a riot outside the courtroom -- that should have created incredible tension , but winds up playing out like a textbook exercise on how not to deploy a scene like this . 

because the movie doesn't know what it's really about , it * can't * generate any genuine tension , and so it has to artifically inject tension through clumsy plotting . 

one of the ways it does this is by throwing in a whole subplot about a bunch of vicious kkk cross-burners -- which is tidied up so neatly that it borders on the nihilistic . 

i was reminded of the despicable betrayed , which tried to tart up a fundamentally empty story by injecting vile , graphic acts of racism as little more than an attention-getter . 

the movie immolates an enormous amount of its potential by making a few critical mistakes . 

first of all , the jackson character is not hard to judge ; there's no tension in his dilemma . 

he's self-admittedly guilty and should be sent to jail , no matter how moral his crusade . 

the old saw about how no court in the land would convict him , if he was white , is supposed to be the underlying theme of the movie , but it's never developed into an organic component of the story . 

it just sort of floats around on top while the movie grinds away furiously with its plot mechanics . 

another mistake is in motivational logic : by not having the two white thugs arraigned first -- or maybe tried and then dismissed from lack of evidence , say -- we have that much less empathy for jackson's character . 

i'm probably supposed to think that just because he had his daughter raped , we are * automatically * supposed to feel empathy for him , but that's precisely the kind of facile thinking that makes real justice impossible . 

 ( see the virgin spring for more on that note . ) 

is jackson's character then simply insane ? 

that prospect isn't given terribly serious treatment either . 

one of the most aggravating things about coutroom movies is how little they seem to know about how the law works , or how lawyers get their information . 

mcconaughey's character makes an important slipup late in the movie , when one of his witnesses turns out to have been convicted of a capital offense . 

how did the prosecution get this information ? 

how come he didn't get it ? 

the whole way these questions get handled are symptomatic of the movie's way of dealing with complex legal and moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slam-bang fashion . 

this is the biggest problem : the movie isn't about jackson's character , or his dilemma , or this case , or any of its ( frequently interesting despite the porcine writing and direction ) characters . 

it's not ultimately about anything at all , except its stupid geared-down plot , which inches onwards in one unremarkable scene after another towards a totally contrived ending . 

at two and a half hours , the movie is overlong and drastically overwritten : there's endless stuff about things which ultimately add up to nothing , and no writing about the material that should really matter . 

it's all handwaving . 

the closing argument are also sneaky and underhanded , and underscored my suspicion that the movie is manipulative and unfair . 

it's not easy to make a movie about something . 

the other day i saw kurosawa's phenomenal rashomon , a movie that is really about the way people deal with truth and reality ( or don't ) . 

a time to kill is as empty and ponderous a movie as i've seen in a long time .

"big courtroom thrillers have always captivated america . 

o . j . 

simpson , tom capano , the menendez brothers . 

all these names are synonymous to americans and courtrooms . 

and , of course , courtroom dramas are not a new topic to hollywood . 

whether it be john grisham's thrilling novels or television's famous dramas , the courtroom has always provided big bucks . 

so when i rented a civil action , i was expecting the film to be like the rainmaker , a brilliant law film that kept viewers on the edge of their seat . 

however , what i saw in a civil action was far different from what i expected , a major surprise , but fortunately , a pleasant one . 

john travolta always seems to come up big when you least expect it . 

no one expected him to light up the screen in grease , nor in saturday night fever . 

but , whenever he gets knocked down , he always seems to come back fighting . 

a civil action is not john's best performance , but a strong one that could rival any performance in 1998 . 

travolta proves that a normal and believable performance can vault a film into oscar nominations . 

his performance is not flashy , nor memorable , just solid . 

if he delivered the only solid performance , this film would still be average . 

luckily , he has a strong supporting cast . 

william h . macy is probably one of the most underrated actors in hollywood . 

he continues to deliver great performances one after the other , but he is still regarded as a secondary actor . 

in a civil action , he delivers yet another great performance as travolta's paranoid and greedy accountant . 

he is not a lovable character , but a character who stands out in your mind whenever you think of the film . 

he is not one of the big time lawyers , just a measly accountant . 

but , he delivers one of the best supporting roles of 1998 , but there is actually someone better in a civil action . 

robert duvall is also an underrated actor . 

he gets many leading roles , but is never heard when you hear of big box office draws like tom hanks , brad pitt and jim carrey . 

duvall has a supporting role in this as a lawyer of the co-defendant . 

duvall is magical in this role . 

he is the wise teacher , who not only battles it out in the courtroom , but also manages to teach every major player a lesson , in his own twisted way . 

in many non-comedic films , directors are always trying to find a way to implement a touch of comedy , to keep the audience on their toes . 

unfortunately , they usually just key in on one character whose main objective is to be funny ( jar-jar binks , anyone ? ) . 

however , this usually backfires because the character is never fully developed . 

this is not the case in a civil action . 

they have comedy coming from all sides . 

whether it be duvall's inane questions or macy's sharp anger , the laughs come in a steady pace . 

granted , it's not roll in the aisle funny , but it provides a nice addition to the film . 

the plot is terrific- somewhat . 

the setup is nice with the film actually starting with a victory in the courtroom . 

then the case that will make or break jan ( travolta ) 's career rears its ugly head . 

they find out the goldmine involved with the case and wind up taking it . 

however , budgets soon flounder and jan finds himself in deep debt . 

i will not spoil the rest , although i must speak of the one downside to the film . 

the courtroom debates are great , but the actual problem they are fighting for is never fully explored . 

it left me somewhat confused , although the rest of the film is terrific . 

all in all , john travolta is back yet again in this great film . 

his supporting cast , consisting of macy and duvall , turn in tremendous performances , which ease the load on travolta . 

the film is smart , witty and thought provoking . 

not only does it gauge in-court battles , but also the various tolls it can take on the major players . 

a civil action provides everything a drama lover craves .

"an attempt at florida film noir , palmetto fails at the most fundamental levels . 

it's slow moving , uninvolving , and plain just uninteresting . 

harry barber ( woody harrelson ) is an ex-newspaper man , just out of jail after being framed for a crime . 

his luck hasn't been the best , but things are looking up when a mysterious woman , rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue ) , approaches him with a proposition . 

she wants harry to help her and her stepdaughter , odette ( chloe sevigny ) , pull off a fake kidnapping scheme to get $500 , 000 out of her stingy , but rich , husband felix ( rolf hoppe ) . 

at first , all harry is expected to do is provide a threatening voice on the phone , and to collect the money ( of which he gets to keep 10% ) . 

but , as the deed is carried out , things are not what they seem , and harry gets caught in the ensuing storm . 

palmetto pulls out all the stops to achieve a film noir film , but the effect never quite comes together . 

it's got the sultry florida heat , seductive women , and even curvier plot twists , but the whole thing smells of paint-by-numbers . 

sure , the right ingredients are there , but the end result is much too artificial . 

a lot of the problems lie with the script , which , though providing some genuine surprises , is packed full of leaden dialogue and bland situations . 

even the plot twists don't seem to flow well with the rest of the story . 

some of them , for example , come from so far afield that they seemingly only make sense because the writer needed a twist ( for example : harry's spontaneous job offer , or the whole typewriter situation ) . 

the characters are mostly lifeless , played to type , but not much more . 

woody harrelson plays harry with such imbecilic thick-headedness that it's hard to even picture him as an ex-journalist . 

elisabeth shue vamps it up , but doesn't add anything special to the role . 

chloe sevigny gives a terrible performance , trying to be a sexy 17-year old , but she just leaves a bad taste in your mouth . 

some of the supporting cast ( notably gina gershon and michael rapaport ) give stronger , but , in the end , meaningless performances . 

and to top it off , the pacing of the film is much too slow . 

as the movie grinds to a halt , you're given too much time to wonder why you're wasting it watching palmetto . 

if you're in the mood for this type of movie , you'd be much better off going out and renting some classic film noir .

" "" desperate measures "" was something i was excited about seeing back when it was originally scheduled to be released : summer '97 . 

for some reason , it was delayed until hollywood's traditional dumping ground : january . 

now that it's out , i see no real reason for that delay , as it's a simple yet highly entertaining film . 

michael keaton stars as a maniacial murderer who's bone marrow can save the life of the dying son of a san francisco police detective ( garcia ) . 

keaton agrees to the transplant , only so he can attempt escape . 

he succeeds , in a plan that of course could only work in the movies . 

the police force is now trying to kill keaton , while garcia is working against them trying to keep keaton alive in order to save his son . 

the film definately has it's flaws . 

the plot is strictly tv movie of the week fare , but the acting and direction certainly boost it far above that status . 

also , after keaton's escape , garcia's captain barks at him "" how many men have to die to save your kid's life ? "" 

which the film treats as such an evil and insignificant remark . 

the thing is , it's a vaild point . 

how many people have to be needlessly crippled , burned , and killed just to save this one child ? 

what's the greater good here ? 

many lives or one life ? 

if movies really had guts nowadays , i would have loved to have seen this movie come down to a final choice for garcia's character . 

place him in a situation where he knows that he has to kill keaton because keaton is about to kill someone else . 

alas , movies these days generally have no such ambition to pull the audience's strings in ways which might make the uncomfortable . 

despite a few silly moments ( and one or two really stupid ones ) , the good things about "" desperate measures "" outnumber the bad . 

the main highlight would be keaton's performance . 

the character could have easily been an overacting , scene chewing freak , but keaton underplays it nicely . 

he's not as menacing as he was in "" pacific heights "" or even as menacing as he was in "" batman "" ( yes kids , batman used to be a dark character ) , but you certainly get the idea that he's evil . 

even the final scene of the film , which normally i would just hate , seems strangely appropriate for this film . 

so much so that i didn't mind it in the slightest . 

and another bonus : the film takes place in san francisco , which usually means a car chase on those hills that you've seen a billion times before . 

and for a moment , it looked as though it was about to happen . 

but it doesn't , and that's creative .

"mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla . 

his entrance , however , is a grand one : out from the trees he leaps , gargantuan and imposing , sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug , and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have . 

joe bellows at the poachers before him , angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars . 

during this scene , i turned to my friend and said , "" wow . 

that's some ape . "" 

joe is quite a gorilla -- a big , digital gorilla . 

he runs around the fields , chasing cars and people . 

he picks things up and stares at them pensively . 

he breaks things on accident , because he's just too big to avoid clumsiness . 

joe , as a special effect , is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes . 

as a character , he doesn't quite register . 

and the story he's been put in is as limp as they come . 

the words "" family entertainment "" have never been a stamp of quality , but might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart . 

the picture is a remake of the 1949 film . 

it's mostly just about the big gorilla , but , strictly as a formality , the movie also has a few human characters . 

the main one is jill young ( poor charlize theron , forced to waste her talent ) , a lover of gorillas . 

as a child , she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother ; now , she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife . 

specifically , she's out to protect joe , a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood . 

soon , zoologist gregg o'hara ( bill paxton ) discovers joe ; he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser ( rade sherbedgia ) , who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill's mother . 

so , in an effort to save joe , jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve , where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers . 

in addition , the space is way too small for him ( after all , he is a really big gorilla ) . 

and , to add to the complications , strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext ( he tells jill that he has a preserve big enough for joe ) , and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jill's mother . 

jill , of course , doesn't recognize strasser , even though he did kill her mother . 

this is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young , a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film . 

the movie isn't really offensive -- it has some competent actors , a few nifty sets , and a lot of scenes with a big , digitized gorilla . 

but the story is really dumb , there aren't any characters , and the film isn't satisfying on any level beyond its visuals . 

the movie also has bad dialogue . 

if a critic says that a film has bad dialogue , it's only fair to quote some of it , but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like "" joe isn't happy ! "" 

and "" joe isn't safe here ! "" 

 "" we need to get joe out of here ! "" 

 "" joe is way too big for that cage ! "" 

i don't know if these phrases are word for word , but they're close . 

as i said , the characters here are only present as a formality : they do little more than state the obvious ( of * course * joe is too big for that cage ) . 

paxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them . 

sadly , mighty joe young wastes them both . 

there are a few clever moments ( although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment ) , and , as i said , the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes . 

it's certainly not a bad film for kids ; i doubt joe will give them nightmares . 

but adults in the audience aren't likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla . 

a big gorilla is only interesting for a little while ; after that , something needs to be done with the big gorilla . 

nobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla .

"most sequels don't do what they're supposed to do like "" toy story 2 "" does . 

far too many of them end up re-hashing the original and adding very little . 

is it any wonder that most sequels fail to live up to their predecessors ? 

thankfully , "" toy story 2 "" is a wonderful exception . 

i can't remember the last time i saw a sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one . 

it's yet another sign that pixar , the acclaimed animation studio behind "" toy story "" and "" a bug's life , "" is still at the top of its game . 

woody and buzz are back in the sequel to the 1995 hit "" toy story , "" and things have changed a bit since the last one ended . 

woody ( voiced by tom hanks ) is preparing to leave with his owner andy for cowboy camp . 

in his absence , he has assigned buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) , now comfortable in his role as a toy , to take charge . 

unfortunately , woody's trip is ruined when he is accidentally put into the family garage sale , and is stolen by an over-zealous toy collector ( wayne knight ) . 

off to save him are buzz and members of the old "" toy gang , "" including mr . potato head ( don rickles ) , rex the nervous dinosaur ( wallace shawn ) , hamm the piggy bank ( john ratzenberger ) , and slinky dog ( jim varney ) . 

while in captivity , woody makes a startling discovery : he is actually part of a collection of toys based on a 1950's children's show entitled "" woody's roundup . "" 

he meets the show's other characters , which include jesse ( joan cusack ) , his cowgirl sidekick , the wise old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) , and bullseye , his trusty horse . 

they have all been anxiously awaiting woody's arrival , as once their set is completed , they will be sold to a japanese toy museum , and finally escape storage forever . 

this means woody now faces a difficult choice . 

with his friends coming to rescue him , does he go with them and spend a few more years with andy , or does he go to japan and be immortalized forever ? 

as in the original film , "" toy story 2 "" contains first-rate animation , and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there . 

reportedly , the film was originally slated for a direct-to-video release , but after seeing the improvements that had been made , disney rightly decided to release it into theaters . 

the film is well worth seeing on the big screen . 

the colors are bright , the textures sharp , and even the human characters look more "" human . "" 

the animation is consistently seamless , with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable . 

there are so many impressive sequences that i'd find it impossible to list them here , but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al' s toy barn , the store owned by woody's captor . 

pixar's rendition of the family dog is also nicely done , with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it . 

the voice work is also perfectly complementary , and as with the first movie , does much to help further character development . 

tom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz , making you forget who is doing the voice . 

it was woody and buzz up there , not tom and tim . 

all the cast members from the original reprise their roles , and each is excellent . 

several new voices have been added , with joan cusack , kelsey grammer , and wayne knight doing fine work . 

 "" toy story 2 "" is strong in characterization , and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie . 

woody faces difficult choices , while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn't yet realized his status as a toy , forcing him to see what he used to be like . 

the new characters are also developed quite well , especially jesse , who narrates a sarah mclachlan-aided flashback illustrating how she was loved , then forgotten by her owner . 

it may be computer-animated , and it may have sappy music , but it's downright touching . 

the script , despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers , is endlessly clever and inventive , especially considering that it's a sequel . 

the reason "" toy story 2 "" works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original's success by re-doing the same story and using the same characters . 

not this one . 

we get character change , new characters , and new issues brought up . 

 "" toy story 2 "" is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself . 

there is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here . 

the humor is sharp and witty , with something to amuse both kids and adults . 

there are funny asides to films such as "" star wars "" and "" jurassic park , "" among others , new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock 'em sock 'em robots , and appearances from other pixar efforts "" a bug's life "" and the 1997 short "" geri 's game . "" 

 ( geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes woody's broken arm . ) 

the action is fast and furious , and the chases ( in the street , in a toy store , in an elevator , on a baggage carousel , and in an airplane ) keep getting bigger and better . 

 "" toy story 2 "" never grows stagnant , because there is always something new to hold your interest . 

the more you pay attention to it , the more rewarding it is . 

it's rare to see a film like "" toy story 2 "" come along , because it's the kind of film that's almost impossible to dislike . 

it's created purely to entertain , and though i enjoy a thought-provoking drama as much as the next person , it's nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do : send us out with a smile . 

it's a fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing "" toy story 2 . "" it's the rare sequel that manages to expand on , and live up to , the original .

"do film critics have morals ? 

are there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow ? 

naturally we don't want to go into a film with any preconceived notions , which is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish . 

secondly , and along the same line , we can't prejudge a film because of it's stars , director , etc . the difference ? 

well , in the first one , we'd go into a film thinking it's going to be dumb or it's going to be good , and that would affect our viewing ( that movie sounds and looks dumb , so i'm not expecting much ) . 

on the second hand , we're simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal "" grudge "" against the film company ( it's made by disney ? 

oh , it's just a merchandising ploy then ) , the actors ( jim carrey's in it ? 

it's gonna stink ! ) , or the director ( who ? 

can't be that good ) . 

this is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint . 

make sense ? 

ok , but what about comparing ? 

isn't that kind of along the same lines ? 

when we compare a certain actor or director or even composer's credibility in one film to another they were involved in , is that really fair ? 

sure , in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more , but what about jackie brown , for example ? 

is it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction , just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both ? 

i think it is , and i'll tell you why . 

a good critic should be able to view the film from the "" average joe ( or jane ) "" viewpoint , while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film . 

sometimes that can be tough . 

 "" the acting was superb , but i was bored "" or "" i loved it ! ! 

it was sooooo cheezy ! "" 

might be used to describe a film . 

these are contradictions , and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique . 

but which is more important ? 

and which is better ? 

an extremely well shot and acted film that is boring , or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again ? 

getting back to the point , my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because we're reflecting what the public wants to know anyway . 

every average person out there who's interested in this film is likely to ask "" how does it compare to pulp fiction ? "" 

and so , as a critic , i'm already responsible to ask that same question . 

jackie brown stars pam grier , the "" blaxploitation "" heroine from the 1970's , who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character . 

tarantino's pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta's sudden revival in the movie industry , and with talks of an oscar nomination , the same is likely to happen for grier . 

 ( we've made it thru comparison #1 ! ) jackie is a 44-year-old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash , and probably her main revenue , by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie ( pulp fiction's samuel l . jackson and comparison #2 ) . 

ordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara ( robert de niro ) , a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years , to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half- million dollars . 

trouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) and taken into custody for possession of narcotics , as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed . 

naturally this proves an obstacle to ordell's plans and , not as friendly intended as we'd hope , he posts jackie's bail after she is put behind bars . 

the thing is , ordell is in this for no one more than himself , and as we learn from his previous actions , he's willing to kill anyone who stands in the way . 

jackie finds herself in a tight squeeze . 

ordell won't think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she's always done , yet at the same time , a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided . 

it comes down to a simple question : would jackie rather face ordell or prison ? 

what ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help : the law , ordell , or maybe just herself . 

coming into play is another 70's veteran , robert forster as jackie's bail bondsmen max cherry . 

max's obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system , and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance . 

also involved is ordell's "" surfer girl "" girlfriend melanie ( bridget fonda ) , a ditzy sun- bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand . 

fonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role , but there's nothing more to her , and therefore , she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters . 

de niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself . 

de niro is a brilliant actor , but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn't need a de niro to play him . 

compared to pulp fiction ( comparison #3 ) , the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable . 

in pulp fiction , even the small , seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful , complete , and lifelike , whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn't have suffered much with a lesser talented cast , the exception being grier . 

tarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind , so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth . 

sadly , grier too could have received a bit more attention , especially when the story is all about her newly-jarred perception of life . 

jackson teams up with tarantino again , but the chemical reaction isn't as awesome as the first time . 

jules was the rambling , bible-quoting hitman in pulp fiction , and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off . 

and although jackson is really , really good in jackie brown , i don't think he's quite as irreplaceable . 

in fact , maybe a new face would have been better . 

jackson could've remained tarantino's jules , and a new guy could have become ordell , forever to remain so in our memories . 

sadly , these characters are too much the same , except ordell just isn't as impressive , and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules . 

another problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning . 

this is grier's film , so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses ? 

it not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted , but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story . 

it is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantino's quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style , and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard's novel "" rum punch "" . 

for those movie-goers , don't expect another pulp fiction and you'll be satisfied , for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of 90's film- making . 

the directing has toned down a bit , however , yet we're still reminded that this is tarantino's movie thanks to odd split-screen story-telling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints . 

so getting back to the question that i began with , this isn't pulp fiction at all . 

it's good , but it isn't anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place . 

this is a more conservative tarantino , but not one that won't satiate true fans . 

if you can realize that this isn't going to knock your socks off , then you'll be happy to at least let it massage your feet . 

after all , we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy .

" "" a man is not a man without eight taels of gold . "" 

starring sammo hung , sylvia chang ; directed by mabel cheung ; written by cheung and alex law ; cinematography by bill wong 

eight taels of gold begins as a fish out of water story and at some point becomes a love story involving two people whose past choices prevent the fruition of their love . 

neither aspect of the movie is entirely successful , but both are good enough . 

and along the way there is one perfect scene , which is one more than you find in most films . 

slim ( played by portly sammo hung , better known as a star and director of hong kong action movies ) is a chinese immigrant who drives a yellow cab in new york . 

when the movie opens , we see him shouting obscenities at another taxi driver . 

he does not seem particularly out of place . 

in fact , he is about to return to visit his home in rural china for the first time in sixteen years , spending most of his life savings in the process , and it is there that he will become the proverbial fish out of water , as he realizes that you can never go home . 

he brings with him some statue of liberty cigarette lighters , cheap sunglasses , and lobsters ( which have to be large , to prove they're american ) --the tokens of his success . 

he also wears a gold chain and a gold watch , because without eight taels of gold , a man is not a man ( my dictionary tells me that taels are a unit of weight used in the far east , and i assume the phrase is a chinese proverb ) . 

he loses most of this stuff--except the gold--when his van crashes into a river and he has to hitch a ride , so to speak , on a raft along the river which runs past his parents' village . 

when he arrives unannounced , he almost induces cardiac arrest in his father . 

all of this has the makings of a routine comedy , and the movie has its amusing moments , as when the villagers take turns giving slim gifts during a celebration of his homecoming , and they all give him birds , so by evening's end he is surrounded by turkeys , ducks , geese and other sundry fowl . 

but eight taels is not a comedy--it is a sad , sweet story about the choices people make , and how they are sometimes irreparable . 

director mabel cheung ( an autumn's tale , the soong sisters ) sees clearly what it is like to have lived half of your life in one country and half in a country on the other side of the world--what it is like to no longer have a place to call home . 

slim does not belong in china , nor does he belong in america , where he can barely speak the language . 

seeing water buffalo in the fields and rafts poled down the river and fireworks exploding gloriously in the sky over a small village , we come to know the world slim left behind , and it seems as if he too is knowing it for the first time , and wishes it felt more like home . 

the condition of the expatriate is eloquently portrayed ; i , being one , was sympathetic . 

on his way to his parent's village , slim hooks up with jenny ( sylvia chang ) , whom he knew when she was a girl nicknamed odds-and-ends , which is what he continues to call her , although she is now a mature , professional , attractive woman , to be married in the spring to an american-chinese man . 

slim and odds-and-ends fall for each other . 

that's predictable . 

the manner in which their ( non- ) romance is played out is not . 

the emotions involved are adult and complex , and the film avoids cheap solutions to their dilemma . 

it's typical , for instance , that the fianc ? in this sort of plot be a colossal jerk , because it makes it easier to empathize with the unrequited lover . 

but here the fianc ? is a decent , ordinary guy , and although slim would like to feel anger , he cannot . 

the fianc ? has done nothing wrong ; the situation is the result of bad luck or bad decisions , take your pick . 

eight taels has its share of flaws ( the early sequences in america and on the plane to china are especially weak ) , but it compensates with insight . 

when odds-and-ends tells slim that her future husband wants to move to san francisco , she notes resignedly , "" it's all the same . 

wherever we go , we'll be in chinatown , "" and her straightforward statement expresses much . 

there is insight , too , in the understanding of the consequences of slim and odds-and-ends' decisions : he to move to america , she to marry a chinese-american . 

both their choices were perhaps born of impatience , perhaps of a sense that the grass is always greener--and it turns out that both choices were wrong . 

but they cannot undo them ; they must live with what they have done . 

such is life . 

the movie is tender toward these people , but it offers no false comforts . 

everything that is right and true about eight taels comes together in one great scene , which is the culmination of the love story . 

slim and odds-and-ends sit in a secluded spot and talk hesitantly , with the muted pop-pop of fireworks exploding in the night behind them , and it seems the conversation will lead to a kiss . 

the exchange that follows , and what slim then does , is poignant and perfect : with clarity and understatement , we see two people's lives , their heartbreaks and virtues , summed up in a single moment . 

yes , the film is flawed , but moments like that justify most of its inadequacies . 
"
"it's always a bad sign when the core audience of a film -- children -- are either walking out early or are half-asleep when the credits roll at the end of a film . 

that about sums up the dreadful ugliness of 102 dalmatians , a cold pea soup of cute animals , stupid home alone antics , a boring puppy love subplot between dumb humans , and glenn close reprising her best joan crawford impression . 

indeed , walt disney is rolling over in his grave again , cursing john hughes' name for making the original live-action 101 dalmatians , one of the worst kiddie flicks of all time , and now its sequel . 

the main culprit behind the hideousness of 102 dalmatians is its predecessor , 101 dalmatians . 

the original made more than $100 million dollars at the box office , spawned a torrid collection of "" collectible "" items that ended up months later in the discount bins of wal-marts across the country , and generally made every kid on the planet want a damn dalmatian pup for christmas . 

well , it's been about four years since then , and dalmatian fever is coming back , and this time it's digitally enhanced . 

here's the story . 

cruella de vil ( glenn close ) is released from prison due to the "" cure "" of her puppy homicide urges by one dr . pavlov . 

 ( oh , how witty . ) 

she rejoins the world as a dog lover and is assigned to a probation officer , who oddly turns out to be her victim from the original film . 

cruella then becomes ella -- dog lover -- until the plot twists , like a dog with his leash caught on the back of a moving truck , and she becomes the evil vixen again . 

a kidnapping plot unfurls again as cruella decides she still needs her dalmatian coat , but she now needs 102 dalmatians instead of the commonly used 101 dalmatian formula . 

at this point , i was envying those kids filing out of the theater . 

how low have glenn close and gerard depardieu ( as the film's villain ) sunk in the film business ? 

it's almost laughable in a sadistic way to watch close walk around in costumes that seem to be pulled from the wardrobe of flash gordon . 

and depardieu . . . 

how can a french guy have a bad french accent ? 

and never mind the toilet brush haircut . 

the only minutely positive selling point i can even think to point out is the talking bird with a british accent ( courtesy of eric idle ) that thinks he's a rottweiler . 

now that's funny .

"1990s would remembered as the era of binary movie events in hollywood - two movies dealing with the same subject , or , to be precise , same "" high concept "" . 

in summer 1994 , that "" high concept "" was "" mad bomber action thriller "" . 

in few weeks , "" thrillride of the summer "" actionfest speed was followed by rather action thriller blown away , so disappointing that most of the people these days associate the title with the 1992 thriller in which nicole eggert did few nude scenes . 

the movie begins in the prison in northern ireland , where gaerity ( tommy lee jones ) , ira terrorist with the great talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any material , escapes from prison . 

he comes to boston , where he accidentally notices jimmy dove ( jeff bridges ) , dedicated bomb disposal expert within boston police . 

few people except gaerity know the dove's violent past , when he used to be ira terrorist before becoming sick with violence , betraying gaerity and emigrating to america where he changed the name and started using his experience for good purpose . 

gaerity holds dove personally responsible for his captivity and begins the campaign of bombing terror , directed specifically at dove's colleagues , friends and relatives . 

dove , who is just going to retire and start family , now must confront the mad bomber . 

while speed doesn't even try to bother with plot and characters , using them only as an excuse for long and spectacular action scenes , blown away tries to be more conventional and provide the action with some back story . 

and that is the main reason why it is inferior to speed . 

badly written plot and badly written characters are sometimes worse than no plot and no characters at all . 

screenplay by john bateer and john rice , barely touches the complicated issues of northern ireland , using the tragedy only as the cheap backstory for even cheaper drama . 

the plot is , of course , full of implausibilities . 

the main one is the fact that movie fails to explain how the single individual , no matter how brilliant he is , can produce thousands of deadly devices and hold entire city at bay . 

those questions , same as in the case of speed , could be forgotten while the action goes on , but the pauses between action scenes are filled with cliched and predictable situation that should provide some background to the characters . 

because of them , movie seems a little bit too long , and boring at times . 

the most annoying element of the film , however , is tommy lee jones in the role of mad bomber . 

his acting is so over-the-top that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himself . 

this role is in painful contrast with the strong performance given by that same actor in fugitive . 

the film have few bright points , though . 

some of the action scenes are fine , which should be credited to director stephen hopkins ( predator ii , judgement night ) . 

and forrest whitaker really shines in minor role of dove's colleague . 

but , all in all , blown away is a film that was justifiably shadowed by its more famous , yet hardly unforgettable competitor . 
"
"i am continually amazed at movies like this . 

that some producer would waste an abundance of talent and money on a script as abysmal as this one is mind-boggeling , but it seems to happen a lot nowadays . 

 "" wild wild west "" is a beautifully filmed , well acted , and well directed piece of garbage ; and its insipid screenplay is completely at fault . 

in short , this movie is a comedy without laughs . 

so many jokes fall flat that it borderlines surreal . 

the high production values keep it from being a total fiasco , but it's still pretty boring . 

will smith stars as jim west , an old western , r&b variation of the james bond character . 

west is teamed up with artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , and they're pretty much polar oppisites : west prefers to solve his problems with an array of bullets , gordon traditionally favors a more pacifistic approach . 

talk about deeply developed characters . 

at any rate , this leads to the inevitable conflicts between methodologies , none of which are funny . 

the year is 1869 . 

several top scientists have been abducted , and the suspected culprit is a disgruntled former confederate general , bloodbath mcgrath ( ted levine ) . 

president grant sends west and gordon to investigate . 

there's evidence that mcgrath is attending some sort of confederate reunion in louisiana . 

west and gordon show up and learn that mcgrath is actually working for dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , another disgruntled former confederate . 

as it turns out , loveless plans to use the combined knowledge of the scientests to create the ultimate super weapon , which he will use to conquer the united states . 

i'd go further with the plot , but there isn't any point . 

this film's narrative is little more than a jumbled , unfunny mess . 

i only laughed at a couple of jokes , and then only lightly . 

there isn't one truly uprorously funny moment in this film , and that's pretty disasterous when you consider that it's primarily a comedy . 

as i said , the fault is totally that of the script . 

when you consider their respective roles , will smith and kevil kline do as good as they could have possibly done . 

the leads could've been played samuel l . jackson and robert de niro and the film still would've been awful . 

no one , and i mean no one , can make a line like "" bye bye , mr . knife guy ! "" 

sound good . 

still , this film has a lot going for it visually . 

the set design is fantastic , maybe even oscar worthy . 

the cinematogrophy by michael ballhaus ( who was also behind camera in martin scorsese's brilliant "" goodfellas "" ) , is absolutely stunning . 

he lends the film a much needed exciting , comic bookish look . 

i won't fault barry sonnenfeld either . 

he does a fine job of directing the proceedings , but , like the rest of the people involved with the film , there really isn't anything that he can do to correct its one major flaw . 

despite being beautifully made , "" wild wild west "" becomes quite boring after the half-way point . 

the appeal of the visuals ends long before the film does . 

if "" wild wild west "" didn't look so good , it would be almost insufferable . 

as it is , it's somewhat tolerable , but not very entertaining . 

it hurts to give such a well made movie a score this low , but there isn't anything much worse than an unfunny comedy .

"note : ordinarily , moviereviews . org will not give away any critical plot points of a film that could be interpreted as "" spoilers . "" 

however , being that music of the heart is based on a true story and that moviereviews . org 

feels the film can not be properly credited without such revelations , plot giveaways will appear in the following review . 

if this bothers you , please note the 3 star rating of the film and stop reading now . 

 "" what does it take to play carnegie hall ? 

practice . "" 

it takes two hours for music of the heart to "" play carnegie hall , "" both figuratively and literally . 

like the children it portrays , the movie starts from the dark realms of awful cinema and works its way up to a show-stopping performance at the legendary concert hall . 

roberta guaspari ( academy award winner meryl streep ) has two kids , a husband who left her and 50 violins she bought from a small shop in the mediterranean . 

her life desperately needs a jump start and gets one when she meets a man who introduces her to a job as a music teacher at an east harlem elementary school . 

she soon finds her job is on the rocks as the men in her life continue to rotate through revolving doors . 

that is the pattern-like plot of this production . 

ultimately , the film chooses a zero-sum answer to these problems and finds her music career at an all-time high when the men in her life finally vanish . 

the first hour of music of the heart is rather painful . 

roberta's character lacks development and consequently seems to be flat . 

also lacking depth is the film's "" bad guy , "" a narrow-minded music teacher ( josh pais ) who rejects roberta out of principle ( the movie never explains exactly which principle that is ) and conveniently comes and goes from the plot according to when it might be dramatic to have a villain around . 

the next 15 minutes of the film are mediocre . 

they are highlighted by one child's return to roberta's class ( coming after the great old hollywood scene where he explains be can't be around anymore because "" my mom said . . . "" ) and a glowing concert . 

not knowing the running time , you may expect the credits to role at this point . 

but they don't . 

instead the film uses the next 45 minutes to finish its journey from bad to mediocre to excellent . 

director wes craven , known for his works of horror , uses some old sentimental tricks to get the audience tearing . 

one romantic break up scene is highlighted by the classic "" but . . . 

last night . . . "" 

and roberta's two children also have textbook conflicts with their single mother regarding their father's absence . 

the city of harlem plays a strong role in the movie . 

roberta's mother is initially reluctant to see her daughter move to that part of town and the film does nothing to combat that stereotype . 

the noise tracks for these scenes are dominated by sirens ; predictably one of roberta's students is gunned down and killed off screen . 

one thing the film does lack is subtlety . 

the fact that a little boy was playing "" we shall overcome "" on his violin after the aforementioned shooting was a cute and discreet reference . 

the fact that the entire orchestra begins to play it over and over soon after is an overdone reference that shows how little credit he gives the audience . 

 ( of course , in horror films the foreshadowing and between-the-line moments are meant to be overdone , so perhaps he too is just learning to play the game . ) 

even with all its flaws , music of the heart is a beautiful film . 

that is not an excuse for the movie's poor beginning . 

but as i watched the scenes in carnegie hall , i thought of some of the great acts that have taken that stage . 

in december of 1979 a comedian named andy kaufman put on a show that will forever be remembered as one of the most original in theatre history . 

the performance included a dead-on elvis impression , robin williams in disguise and a moment at the end when kaufman announced he would take the whole audience out for milk and cookies . 

so , how did this comic genius choose to open the show of his life ? 

he had a character named tony clifton take the stage for the sole purpose of irritating and angering the audience . 

perhaps it is okay for music of the heart to start off rusty because just as kaufman had santa's favorite food , this movie has an amazing finale . 
"
"capsule : the weakest and least engaging of the alien movies , dragged down by an uninvolving story and no real tension . 

alien 3 ( the "" 3 "" should be in superscript ) is a sad and wan entry in what was shaping up as one of the best sf sagas ever put on screen . 

it continues the story of ripley , the space-trucker-turned-impromptu-survivalist , but seems remarkably uninterested in her . 

in fact , the movie seems lucky to be interested in anything at all , it's so elegaic and limp . 

a little of this would have been nice for atmosphere , but the movie telegraphs its own tragedy from the beginning . 

at the end of the last film ( aliens ) , ripley and two survivors were on their way home . 

unfortunately , an alien pod had been deposited in their ship , and wound up triggering off their ejection in an escape pod . 

the pod crashes on firorina 161 , a prison planet designed to house the incurably criminally violent . 

ripley lives through the crash ; the others do not . 

the prison is a grim place , even as prisons go -- it's been built around the remnants of an abandoned steelworks , which provides no end of techno-gothic backdrops for the actors to be backlit against . 

lice are endemic , and so ripley's head is shaved ( another surreal touch ) . 

at first it looks like she just has to hold out as an unwelcome guest until a company rescue ship can arrive , but it doesn't stay that way . 

one of the other eggs on board the wrecked escape pod hatches , and soon a newly-gestated alien is running amuck . 

worse , it looks like ripley herself has been impregnated . 

what's weird is how little tension this generates , except near the end , when the pressure is being troweled on through every cheap cinematic form of cheating imaginable : loud music , shaky camerawork , etc . sigourney weaver has become comfortable with the role , and she does well with it , but this time the role has been underwritten and left slack . 

the supporting actors are also not given a lot to do : the doctor ( charles dance ) and another , rather religious inmate ( charles s . dutton , very good ) , hiave presence , but they're not asked to do anything with it . 

in light of the impending sequel , which apparently plays fast and loose with the ending of this movie , i will not talk about the ending -- except to say that they found a remarkably good ending for such a drab movie . 

it's strange that some of the desperate and improvisational thinking that they found to wind up this story couldn't have driven the rest of it . 
"
"forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects . 

set in 1692 at salem , massachusetts , the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon . 

they beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells . 

then one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes . 

not to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor ( daniel day lewis ) , abigail ( winona ryder ) suddenly seizes a chicken , beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood . 

taking even adolescent hormone surges into account , surely this chicken-bashing bit is a bit excessive , especially for prim puritan sensibilities ? 

surely to the puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets ? 

the crucible errs from the beginning and arthur miller's name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play . 

this is far from a harmless event , a bad start to an already shaky morality tale . 

the play describes the film's opening scene during tense exchanges that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply , and this adds to the play's charged atmosphere . 

in the film , the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandora's box . 

not only is credulity stretched but abigail's obsession is unfortunately spotlighted . 

it positions the crucible more as a cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts ; it will bring back the memory of a rabbit boiling away in a pot . 

not surprisingly , the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when two girls fail to wake the following morning , witches are invoked by those eager to blame . 

when the girls are questioned , their confession of guilt is accompanied with an announcement of their return to god and they are thereafter converted to immaculate witnesses , led lustfully by abigail . 

with alarming synchronicity our hormonally-advantaged girls zealously gesture and point accusing fingers at innocents , constant reminders that abigail's passion sets all this into inexorable motion . 

abigail seizes on this opportunity to rid herself of her rival for john proctor's love , his wife elizabeth ( joan allen ) , by including her among those accused of witchcraft . 

appropriately narrow-waisted and equipped with a distractingly white smile ( watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to a murky yellow ) , day lewis plays the dashing moral hero with an over-earnestness that longs to be watched . 

director nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis' foaming-mouth fervour with shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on a pedestal for our admiration . 

otherwise , hytner's direction is unremarkable . 

ryder's performance as abigail is as consistent as her mood swings . 

her fits of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful . 

abigail supposedly revels in her newfound power , but ryder fails at being convincingly haughty although there is much haughtiness to spare here . 

paul scofield is fine as the overzealous judge danforth , but the incessant moral posturings of all the characters along with the recurrent histrionics of the young girls pricks at the nerves . 

probably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing , allen's elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character . 

a scene near the end featuring a private conversation between the imprisoned elizabeth and john is undeniably powerful because for once we are given a reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequences are revealed . 

unfortunately , when john's audience again increases to more than one his urge to pontificate returns and the human urgency of his situation is lost . 

it is clear that miller meant well but i do wish he did it with more delicacy and fewer diversions . 

his screenplay is an imperfect creature with the distractions coming out as loud as the message . 

the result is a clumsy muddle - i felt like the chicken from the opening scene , head ceaselessly banged with piousness too heavy-handed to be wholly believable . 

when the gallows beckoned , it was sweet release indeed . 

far from bewitching , the crucible tests the patience .

rated pg-13 for mild language , adult situations , drug use , martial art action and violence . 

107 minutes . 

super 35mm / panavision ( 2 . 35 : 1 ) 

what can you say about jackie chan that hasn't already been said . 

since the release of 'rumble in the bronx "" back in 1996 ( the u . s . release ) , jackie has become a fairly recognizable commodity on america's video shelves . 

having made over 80 films , jackie has finally succeeded in bringing his style of action-comedy to the west . 

his latest release , "" shanghai noon "" , is a joyful tribute / spoof of the classic western . 

and by adding jackie chan into the genre , the tag line for the film ( "" the western gets a kick in the pants "" ) rings true . 

jackie stars as chon wang , a lesser imperial guard in the forbidden city of china . 

the royal princess pei pei ( lucy liu ) is set to be married to the obnoxious son of a nobleman from another prefecture . 

unwilling to follow her father's wishes , princess pei pei with the assistance of her english tutor , decides to escape to america . 

but this is all a ploy devised by exiled guard lo fong , which will lead to the princess' kidnapping and ransom . 

unable to take any legal action , the ransom demands are met and three of the forbidden city's bravest guards ( played by cui ya hi , rong guang yu , and eric chen ) are ordered to transport the ransom payment to lo fong in carson city , nevada . 

chon wang pleads with the imperial court and is given permission to join the team , as he is looked upon as a buffoon . 

on a train in the u . s . jackie meets up with bandit roy o'bannon ( owen wilson ) . 

he is much less of a bandit than he is a glory hog , looking simple for the notoriety and fame that being a bandit will bring him . 

with his gang in tow , roy attempts to rob the train , when one of his gang murders the chinese interpreter of the royal court , who also happens to be chon wang's uncle . 

chon wang gives chase , foiling the attempted robbery , but also leaving himself stranded in the desert . 

as the disgraced guard wanders through the desert , he again comes upon roy , who has been left for dead by his former gang . 

buried up to his neck in the desert , roy pleads with chon to dig him out . 

chon demands to know where carson city is . 

roy directs him , and chon leaves . 

but not before sticking two chopsticks into roy's mouth and telling him to dig himself . 

chon soon finds himself confronted by angry crow warriors , a friendly sioux tribe , gunslingers , a horse that thinks and behaves like a dog and an indian bride ( brandon merrill ) , before once again running into roy . 

 "" shanghai noon "" is just good fun . 

the chemistry between the cast is remarkable . 

the performances are all acceptable within the whimsical levels of the film . 

jackie's performance is as good as anything he's done before . 

he's not called on to do much acting here , as the character is not written with any depth . 

but jackie's natural charisma shines through , and his comic timing is so perfect , both physically and ( surprise ) verbally that once again he commands the screen whenever he is on . 

owen wilson , last seen in the embarrassing remake of "" the haunting "" , gives a good natured performance as roy o'bannon . 

his innocence is refreshing and fun . 

a bad guy that's not really bad . 

his scenes with jackie are some of the best bits of comic dueling since martin and lewis . 

lucy liu as princess pei pei is given little to do in the script , but for a change does not play a nymphet or some other deviant . 

the character is a noble woman of status and wealth , but finds a greater cause as a result of her own imprisonment . 

the rest of the performances are all broadly drawn comic performances . 

nothing here is realistic , mind you . 

 "" shanghai noon "" is first and foremost a light , jovial film . 

and the performances match that style with ease . 

the cinematography by dan mindel is gorgeous . 

using calgary , alberta as the prime location . 

mr . mindel is able to create a lush , romantic western feel to the film . 

nothing here really looks like nevada , but the locations are so beautifully shot and staged , the film can be looked upon as a loving tribute to earlier films of the genre . 

and as such , the script by alfred gough and miles millar plays fast and loose with history , but with reverence to past films . 

homage to such films as "" high noon "" ( obviously ) , "" red river "" and most notably "" butch cassidy & the sundance kid "" all bring a sense of nostalgia to the film . 

it is a comforting experience . 

at a time when the western is considered either old hat or irrelevant , here is a film that embraces those old attitudes and ( dare i say ) clich ? s and manages to make them palatable and refreshing . 

here is a film that is not contemptuous of the genre . 

this is the purest "" horse opera "" since the days of george o'brian or john wayne . 

director tom dey has crafted a loving tribute to hollywood's past . 

in this , his first film mr . dey shows both a love of character and of craftsmanship that is refreshing to see . 

nothing here really stands out , or takes one's attention away from the story or action . 

and that is as it should be , when jackie chan is your star . 

and what of the action and stunts . 

well , while not up to a level of "" drunken master 2 "" or any of jackie's hong kong films , "" shanghai noon "" is miles ahead of anything jackie has done in an american film before . 

his timing , choreography , and creativity are still as sharp as ever . 

jackie even gets to recreate a few scenes from his earlier films ( obvious to those of us that have seen those films , but refreshingly fun for those unfamiliar ) . 

finally jackie can honestly say , that he has made an u . s . , his way and incorporating his style . 

to sum up , "" shanghai noon "" is a fun summer confection . 

not too heavy and not too light . 

a fun and entertaining film that the whole family can enjoy ( parents be advised there are scenes of smoking , drunkenness and peyote use ) . 

an enjoyable and charming film that can and will be enjoyed again and again .

"capsule : earthy , experimental , difficult , shockingly frank ( even for 1997 ! ) , and ultimately refreshing story of a black man on the run from the cops . 

the first few minutes of sweet sweetback's baad asssss song ( yes , i checked -- that's the correct number of ss ) are without dialogue , just eerie montages of sounds . 

a young boy , obviously malnourished , is taken in and fed up by several loving mother-surrogate figures . 

then one of them takes the boy to bed for a sexual initation ( underneath the title credits ) that's far more confrontatory and shocking than any ten basic instincts -- probably because it has the directness and clumsiness of real life , something we're not used to seeing on screen . 

this is one tough movie to swallow , no matter who you are , but that probably reflects more on how pallid and unchallenging movies have gotten lately . 

 ( i suspect the sex scenes in movies like el topo and salo would probably melt the synapses of most modern audiences . ) 

the plot is simple but not simpleminded . 

sweetback , hassled by two white cops who are apparently just looking for an excuse to beat up on a black man , breaks his bonds and runs like hell . 

along the way he moves through a good many of the kinds of environments that we are only just now being seen in a more serious light in the movies -- or at all , for that matter : the slums , the missions , the ghetto . 

in other , lesser , movies , sweetback would be machine-gunning everything in sight and the end credits would roll over a pile of bodies ; in this one , we get taken on a kind of a tour of the depressing and anarchic world that sweetback takes for granted . 

ssbas first appeared in 1971 and was promptly rated x ( "" by an all-white jury "" , as director melvin van peebles crowed in his legendary ad campaigns ) , and it's hardly surprising why . 

there's a good deal of sex in the movie , but it's handled in a way that's unsettlingly frank -- a frankness that spills over into the rest of the movie . 

in one scene , sweetback visits a friend's house in the hope of getting sanctuary there , and the other man chats him up while on the toilet . 

we're not used to coming this close to people in real life , let alone in the movies -- especially not people who are not made out to be glamorous . 

the movie is also full of experimental stylistics that are relatively unused today , but probably because of that seem curiously fresh and new in van peebles' hands . 

one scene , in which a man is interrogated by the cops , is loaded full of menacing energy as they fire off a gun inches from his ears , and suggest his deafness through a cleverly edited soundtrack . 

another note : ssbas is not so much anti-white ( that would be too easy ) as anti-authority , and as the movie goes on to demonstrate , authority exists in many forms -- governments , churches , and even the paranoid inside of one's own mind . 

ssbas is ultimately about thirsting for freedom -- and it looks like we could use a little more of that in our movie diet , god knows .

"once upon a time jean-claude van damme was a decent action hero . 

the muscles from brussels bursted into the hollywood market with mindless adventure films , boasting his spectacular martial-arts ability . 

some of these excursions were fun . 

but now it seems like watching a van damme movie has become a painful chore , with no rewards but the virtually guaranteed helping of mind-numbing action . 

and when the action goes sour , what is there left to enjoy ? 

i'll explain . 

knock off is about a pair of counterfeit jeans salesmen working out of an office in hong kong . 

marcus ray ( van damme ) , a babe-magnet and stylish dresser , heads up the company with an annoying weasel of a partner ( rob schneider ) . 

they become part of a plot involving microbombs implanted in counterfeit jeans , seemingly by a mole in the business . 

i'm going to reveal about everything in the next paragraph , so if you want a review devoid of spoilers , skip onto the next one . 

i'm not quite sure who gives a crap , but i'll issue a warning anyhow . 

tommy is really working with the cia . 

his boss ( a very hammy and flat paul sorvino ) is the mole , and he wants to cause carnage with these tiny but immensely powerful super weapons . 

he even stoops so low to put them into children's toys . 

if you thought this plot outline sounded intriguing , then you probably will enjoy knock off . 

if you think that this ridiculous set-up couldn't even fill five minutes of screen time without causing you to roll over laughing , this might not be your cup of tea . 

knock off sucks . 

it stoops to ridiculous levels that most individuals could only conjure up in horrific nightmares . 

it amazes me how far these producers will go to sell something , simply because van damme is the star . 

the plot is pathetic garbage strung together by inane action sequences that will baffle your mind , the performances are so wooden you could use them to row a canoe , and the action itself is an absolute catastrophe . 

director tsui hark ( who teamed with van damme in the superior , but still lame-brained double team ) is at the helm , and he would rather attempt to dazzle us with fantastic camera angles than engage us with the plot . 

i suppose i enjoyed some of the camera work , but the incessant desperation of it all made me rather nauseous . 

the picture freezes in the middle of an action sequence , speeds are altered consistently , and the camera tricks mostly apply to traveling up gun barrels as the weapons are fired . 

it all sounds very cool . 

trust me , it isn't . 

as much as it scars me to say this ( har , har ) , van damme is terrible . 

sure , he does lots of fancy kickboxing moves and dodges giant crates with the greatest of ease . 

he looks like he's doing a bad impersonation of jackie chan , and his performance is stiff and tired . 

i hate to say it , but perhaps it's time for mr . van damme to give up his day job . 

it's really a test of endurance watching knock off . 

i suppose there's some enjoyment derived from schneider's character , who is extremely annoying , but provides the film's better moments . 

and what is the beautiful lela rochon doing in this movie ? 

hopefully she grabbed her paycheck and then fled the premises like an olympic sprinter . 

knock off doesn't even stand strong as a mindless but entertaining action film , like a handful of van damme's others . 

no , this movie is an embarrassment to the entire action genre of modern filmmaking . 

and considering how low hollywood has stooped as of late in that department , that is certainly not saying much .

"a standoff . 

a man holds a woman , a diplomat's daughter , hostage in his embrace , a gun pressed to her head . 

a cop , impaired by drink due to his wife's philandering , trains his gun on the man's nether regions , threatening to shoot . 

another cop holds his gun to his partner's temple , forcing him to disarm . 

the scene unfolds like a foursome bidding in bridge--upping the ante , signaling tacitly , going for game . 

the second cop retrieves the first cop's weapon , the suspect lowers his , and the woman caught in the middle moves--in slow motion--to safety . 

it is then that the intoxicated officer makes his move , grabbing for the assailant's gun . 

the room turns upside down , a shot rings out , a cop is down . 

shot in the back and paralyzed for life . 

the young man who found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time is sent to prison for six years for a crime he didn't commit . 

storytelling has always been one of pedro almod ? var's greatest gifts and in "" live flesh "" he gives us a twisting , turning , compelling tale peppered with well-written , colorful characters . 

characters who find themselves , more often than not , in carefully-constructed scenes like these . 

characters played by actors we might not know , but who look strikingly familiar nevertheless . 

take the ruggedly handsome victor plaza ( liberto rabal ) , for instance . 

before he gets out of prison he could easily be mistaken for that almod ? var favorite , antonio banderas . 

when we first meet elena ( francesca neri ) , the woman in the middle of the nervous shakedown , she looks like spice girl barbie with her frizzy shock of orange hair , but later tones down her look sufficiently to pass for juliette lewis . 

elena's husband david ( javier bardem ) is the cop crippled in the shooting and he wears david schwimmer's bemused expression throughout . 

playing the inebriated cop and his cheating wife are jos ? sancho and angela molina--no lookalikes spring to mind , but they round out the excellent cast . 

it's a credit to almod ? var's craft that these five individuals cross paths and intertwine with such credulity . 

 "" live flesh "" begins and ends with a live birth and the film's contradictions come almost as often as the contractions . 

between the two childbearings , coincidence , irony , and a hefty dollop of sex form the key elements of this thoroughly entertaining film . 

although based on a ruth rendell story , "" live flesh "" is brimming with the acclaimed spanish director's high-heeled flourishes . 

women are at times alluring and repulsive , their extravagant hairdos and animal print coats providing colorful highlights to the intricately-woven drama , an eye bruised by an abusive husband here , a mouth bloodied by an impromptu delivery there . 

while in prison , victor learns bulgarian from an inmate and learns to love the bible , quoting from deuteronomy thereafter not unlike the way by which david and sancho refer to themselves as "" guardians of a sick flock . "" 

victor's pre-fab inheritance is a shambles in a slum resembling sarajevo . 

 "" dear son , i got cancer "" his mother writes to him in jail . 

she dies before he is released and it's at the cemetery that victor is reacquainted with elena--redemption , ultimately , substituting for revenge .

"the second serial-killer thriller of the month is just awful . 

oh , it starts deceptively okay , with a handful of intriguing characters and some solid location work . 

after a baby-sitter gets gutted in the suit- ably spooky someone's-in-the-house prologue , parallel stories unfold , the first involving a texas sheriff ( r . lee emery ) , a gruesome double murder , and the arrival of a morose fbi agent ( dennis quaid ) on the eve of voting for the local lawman's reelection . 

the second pairs a hitch- hiker ( jared leto ) with a friendly former railroad worker ( danny glover ) . 

they're headed west , toward the rockies and away from the murder scene . 

which one is the killer ? 

well , it doesn't really matter , 'cause when writer/first-time director jeb stuart ( die hard ) finally spills the beans , you won't take his choice seriously anyway . 

the whole thing goes south about an hour in , with the tale taking hairpin turns that i certainly couldn't follow . 

and through the whole thing there's quaid , playing with the most intense monotony this side of steven sea- gal . 

i guess i'm glad that i didn't walk out-- there's some nice train stuff at the end and a fun nod to dr . 

strangelove .

"delicatessen ( directors : marc caro/jean-pierre jeunet ; screenwriters : gilles adrien/marc caro ; cinematographer : darius khondji ; editor : herve schneid ; cast : dominique pinon ( louison ) , marie-laure dougnac ( julie clapet ) , jean-claude dreyfus ( clapet-the butcher ) , karin viard ( mademoiselle plusse ) , ticky holgado ( marcel tapioca ) , anne-marie pisani ( madame tapioca ) , jacques mathou ( roger ) , rufus ( robert kube ) , howard vernon ( frog man ) , edith ker ( granny ) , boban janevski ( young rascal ) , mikael todde ( young rascal ) , chick ortega ( postman ) , silvie laguna ( aurore interligator ) , howard vernon ( frog man ) ; runtime : 96 ; miramax/constellation/ugc/hatchette premiere ; 1991-france ) 

reviewed by dennis schwartz 

a black comedy set in the near future in a boarding house run by a depraved butcher . 

the comedy is played more in comic strip style for entertaining value than for deeper satire , as it features mostly zany sophomoric sight gags and relies heavily on special effects . 

the world has fallen on hard times and there are food shortages which include no meat , so the butcher serves up meat from human flesh to customers who pay with grain , almost as valued a commodity . 

that's the big joke in the film and the novelty of that cannibalism idea wears thin mighty fast , as the characters are too absurd and sketched too thinly for us to care about them . 

this tasteless postapocalyptic french comedy is a first feature for the co-directors marc caro/jean-pierre jeunet . 

it failed to reach my funny bone and instead left me mostly annoyed at its slight story and its dark projections for the future . 

an ex-circus clown named louison ( dominique pinon ) , the film's too-good-to-be-true hero , answers an ad for work as a handyman for clapet ( jean-claude dreyfus ) , and the butcher and landlord , offers him room and board in his house . 

the butcher's clumsy and near-sighted daughter julie ( marie-laure dougnac ) falls in love with the skinny , weird looking clown , and the two make some music together , with her playing the cello and him a saw . 

they are the innocents , surrounded by a boarding house of misfits suffering from fear and watched over by her overbearing father , who has lured into his tenement the clown , as he has his past innocent victims , so that he can put his cleaver to him and then sell him as meat , which he intends to do as soon as the clown fixes up the tenement . 

the entire film takes place in the shabby tenement , and the tenants are an odd lot of bizarre malcontents , who do not trust each other . 

there are two youngsters ( boban janevski & mikael todde ) who do any kind of mischief they can . 

a frog man ( howard vernon ) who lives with water on the floor so he can raise his frogs and snails that he eats . 

two brothers ( mathou & kube ) who create little cow-moo novelty toys . 

a man ( holgado ) who sells a bullshit detector to the butcher for his piece of meat . 

a slutty woman ( karin viard ) , who lives with the butcher and only wants his meat . 

the aristocratic woman ( silvie laguna ) who tries numerous times to commit suicide but is too inept to do it right . 

the tenants are too afraid to come out at night because they know what the butcher is up to , so they are forced to communicate with each other through a pipe that runs through the building ( in one scene they are all in musical harmony to the lovemaking of the butcher and his gal , as their bedsprings squeak ) . 

there is also a sex-crazed postman ( chick ortega ) , who lusts for the butcher's daughter and carries a gun while delivering the mail . 

there is also an underdeveloped subplot about a band of incompetent underground veggie fanatics , called trogolodistes , who have been summoned to rescue the clown and steal some grain . 

the directors overloaded the film with too many eccentrics , as the comedy seemed forced while the surreal look of the film added no dramatic intensity . 

delicatessen could have some appeal to the cult film crowd who like their meat sliced thin , monty python fans , and those who liked terry gilliam's brazil , a film similar in spirit .

"the last steve martin film i saw , the spanish prisoner , was a very different approach for the comic actor . 

as a millionaire leading a massive conspiracy in order to rob "" a process "" from a clueless businessman , martin's character did it all for money . 

in his most recent movie , bowfinger , martin plays yet another con man except this time he does it to succeed in the film industry . 

he wants to direct a successful picture that will force people to remember his name , that will make him more popular at the parties , and , most importantly , that will cause fed ex to deliver important business packages to his front door . 

playing the title role , martin is once again the good guy ; the one we cheer for to complete his low budget action movie . 

this con man is very likeable for some reason , even though he is doing the same exact thing as the malicious jimmy del from the spanish prisoner . 

maybe the message is that , in hollywood , to win over the trust and friendship of others , you have to be a little evil . 

bowfinger is a very clever comedy with great performances from its two stars . 

martin , who also wrote the screenplay , is perfect as a jerk with a conscience and eddie murphy does his best "" peter sellers "" in two different , but equally hilarious , roles ; one as a big time move star and the other as his nerdy , burger king employee brother . 

the story follows aging and failing director/producer bobby bowfinger as he makes one last attempt to become a respected member of his field by creating a b-action movie called chubby rain . 

in order to attract actors and crew members , bowfinger promises them that hot shot actor kit ramsey will star in the movie . 

the only problem is that kit refuses to be in it . 

but this won't stop the aggressive bowfinger . 

he is so determined to complete his film that he decides to put kit in it without even telling him . 

he has his actors approach kit on the streets of los angeles in character with a hidden camera filming the footage . 

will bowfinger be able to make his film ? 

or will kit ramsey discover what exactly is going on ? 

bowfinger is a very cartoon-like movie that pokes fun at hollywood and its famous residents while simultaneously holding a very solid story line . 

the only area where the film really lacks is the cameo department . 

this is the kind of movie that cameos are all about , it is always funny to see actors/directors/producers making fun of themselves or co-workers especially in a playful movie such as this . 

besides the very repetitive and superflous ending , bowfinger is a joy to watch . 

if you take a movie like this seriously then you will never enjoy it . 

if you accept the incredulous plot and the extreme caricatures of real entertainment figures , the movie is great fun .

"susan granger's review of "" session 9 "" ( usa films ) 

sometimes you just get more than your bargained for . . . like when boston-based hazmat elimination , run by scottish actor peter mullan and his trusty assistant , david caruso , assures a town engineer ( paul guilifoyle ) that they can remove insidious asbestos fibers from a victorian hospital facility in a week . 

erected in 1871 , deserted and decomposing since 1985 , the danvers mental hospital , is one of the most malevolent "" locations "" ever chosen for a film . 

the structure is so massive - with its labyrinth of rubble-strewn corridors , collapsing floors , stagnant pools of water , isolation cells , and ominous surgical chambers where experimental pre-frontal lobotomies were performed - that their task seems impossible within that time frame . 

and each member of their inexperienced crew ( stephan gevedon , brandon sexton iii , and josh lucas ) is coping with his own personal demons as , one by one , their minds seem to be affected by the grim areas in which they're working . 

the film's title is derived from salvaged reel-to-reel audio-recorded sessions involving the demonic possession of a young woman who is suffering from multiple personalities . 

by the time session 9 occurs so do dreadful disasters . 

filmmaker brad anderson obviously envisioned this as a gruesome chainsaw-massacre-type ghost story but the script lacks structure and isn't particularly scary . 

the conclusion is more ludicrous than convincing . 

on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" session 9 "" is a dark , gloomy 4 . silly me . . . at 

first , i thought that the original name of the danvers lunatic asylum bore some reference to mrs . danvers , the creepy housekeeper played by judith anderson in alfred hitchcock's truly terrifying "" rebecca "" that also involved a cavernous mansion called manderley .

"how do you judge a film that is so bad , but intentionally so ? 

in spiceworld , the highly popular singing group the spice girls accomplish their major goal : mocking themselves with a purposely cheezy film and having a lot of fun doing it . 

if that was their goal , they did a fantastic job . 

so is it fair to give it such a low grade when it wasn't really meant to be much better than this ? 

honestly , i'd rather see this film before many others i gave higher grades , so does that mean i graded it inaccurately ? 

truth be known , i don't really think i can answer this question . 

to understand spiceworld , you have to understand the spice girls . 

unless you're very * very * young , or fairly older , you probably have at least heard of them . 

they're a group of five busty british babes who've had #1 hit singles and whose debut album sold millions . 

they're primarily adored by pre-teen girls who hope someday the contents of their training bras might match those of ginger spice's ( real name : geri haliwell ) wonderbra . 

all five of the girls have these "" spicy "" names for which they are better known than their real names . 

there is the aforementioned ginger spice , as well as sporty spice ( melanie chisholm , or mel c . ) , scary spice ( melanie brown , or mel b . ) , baby spice ( emma bunton ) , and posh spice ( victoria addams ) , and all of them , to some degree or another , resemble their stage names . 

the spice girls took the world by storm , and spiceworld is actually a good- humored spoof of all that transpired during their quick rise to fame . 

it's quite nice to see what good sports the girls are ( and not just the one dubbed sporty ) about poking fun at themselves . 

they don't take themselves too seriously , and that's probably the best thing about them . 

it's also surprising how natural they seem in front of the camera * acting * , and not just singing and dancing . 

they're not flawless by any means , but for the most part , they deliver their lines without feeling staged , and , like them or not , we get the sense the five are very at home within their characters ( which seems reasonable since they portray themselves ) . 

what makes the film bad is that extreme fans of the spice girls won't get enough of their music , while the rest of us don't get enough of a movie . 

the real point of this is to look at the spice girls for over ninety straight minutes . 

most of the film is very blas ? , but several parts are downright boring , and then they have those sporadic moments that actually make us laugh out loud ! 

if you're a big fan of the group , you probably won't get enough of what you want , and if you're not a big fan , you get too much time devoted to nothing more than "" look at us "" moments . 

for the right crowd , the "" music video "" sequences will be the highlights of the film , but for others , they will serve as three-minute lulls in a hectic-but-overall-uneventful storyline . 

other key actors include richard e . grant as clifford , the spice girls' manager , alan cumming as the film-maker piers cutherton-smyth who attempts to make a documentary of the group , george wendt as martin barnfield , a producer who constantly works on pitching a spice girls movie , and roger moore in a small , self-parodizing role . 

all provide relatively good performances , keeping in mind once again that this film wasn't meant to be acted seriously . 

even meat loaf shows up as dennis the bus driver and seems to have fun with it . 

while this film is continuously compared to the beatles' a hard day's night , i think that is an unjust comparison . 

it is supposedly the movie studio that first mad the comparison by way of press kits , but i don't think drector bob spiers , nor the spice girls , intended it to be so . 

i think the studios were just trying to boost hype and interest in the film , and have instead , come off rather pretentious . 

i don't think this film is trying to be anything more than a fun , satirical look at a group that got so big , a movie seemed the next likely step . 

and what could've been better than a self-indulged yet self- mocking approach ? 

probably nothing , and so it is . 

spiceworld is a movie i thought would be embarrassing to enjoy , but now instead , i find myself wanting to defend a movie i didn't even give a good review . 

it's bad , but it succeeds in every way it intended . 

it gives the spice girls a chance to play while allowing all those obsessive fans out there to indulge in every brainless moment . 

perhaps the group is nothing more than a gimmick . 

if that's the case , the movie's gimmick is that it * is * such a gimmick ! 

you might be saying , "" a spice girls movie ? 

come on ! "" , but when it comes down to it , i think that's the point .

"in the series of the erotic thrillers that flooded the videoshelves in the early 1990s came this french-canadian co-production by max fischer . 

the movie is set in paris where its hero , struggling american author david mirkine ( judd nelson , at the time specialised in playing losers and people at the edge of sanity ) suffers a terrible writers bloc . 

he manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic relationship with beautiful model anabelle ( laurence treill ) . 

unfortunately , she hangs out in jet set circles , which gradually makes mirkine pathologically jealous . 

her connection with powerful david caravan ( pierce brosnan ) would make mirkine step the line between reason and sanity and put in motion whole series of violent and tragic events . 

although few pseudoerotic scenes and some elements of the plot do indeed make this film an erotic thriller , drama would probably be more appropriate genre label . 

pacing of the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers , and those patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait a long time between any interesting or significant developments . 

low budget also becomes painfully visible , and physical attributes of laurence treill are the only thing worth watching in this film . 

unfortunately , this film has too little of those supposedly erotic scenes , so those who wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons to feel disappointed . 

instead , they would have to settle with pointless , slow scenes involving nelson , brosnan and laurence treill's attempts of serious acting . 

all of those definitely not worth spending hour and half of someone's precious time .

"synopsis : upper middle class , suburban family man lester ( kevin spacey ) realizes that he is just going through the motions : he is unable to feel passion ; he is soulless , cynical , and no longer able to feel the edge between success and failure . 

everyone else around him has similar symptoms . 

lester's unassertive daughter jane ( thora birch ) is too lethargic to change her world , yet all too ready to whine and complain . 

his wife carolyn ( annette bening ) is reduced to keeping up appearances and reciting commercialist slogans . 

and these are people with a big house and a decent standard of living . 

the only person who seems able to appreciate beauty and freedom and life is the person most deprived of it : a dope-dealing teen from across the street who is practically imprisoned by a domineering , bullying father . 

when lester embarks on a mad scramble to feel the edge again , the fact that he has quit his job to feel what it's like - - and his newfound interest in exercise to impress a teenage girl - - ruffle a lot of feathers in the family . 

will lester regain his ability to appreciate life ? 

opinion : people say it all the time : you never appreciate good health until it's gone . 

likewise , people raised in fabulously pampered prosperity can become unhappy and spiteful over the dumbest , most inconsequential problems , simply because they have no clue how good they have it . 

sometimes it takes a near fall - - accidentally or through deliberate fasting - - to move out of apathy and reclaim your ability to challenge the world . 

the deprivation/appreciation cycle is a major theme of american beauty . 

american beauty is a non-formula , intelligent and articulate movie that offers fantastic performances by everyone in the cast , especially kevin spacey , who is simply gosh darn amazing this movie . 

the thing i like about american beauty is that there is no sentimental music , no hospital scene nor any overly dramatic hokum . 

the movie entertains and offers brilliant performances just as is . 

if you are in the mood for a thoughtful , non-formula flick , i highly recommend american beauty .

"the law of crowd pleasing romantic movies states that the two leads must end up together by film's end . 

if you're not familiar with this law , then maybe you've seen the trailer for this film which shows that the two leads are together by film's end . 

now if you're a regular reader of mine , you've heard me say this countless times : you know how drive me crazy is going to end , but is the journey to get to that ending worth it ? 

no , it definitely is not . 

melissa joan hart ( from abc's "" sabrina , the teenage witch "" ) likes a hunky stud on the basketball team . 

adrien grenier is her grungy neighbor who's just broken up with his activist girlfriend . 

apparently he wants to make his ex-girlfriend jealous enough to take him back , and she wants someone to take her to the big year end dance . 

so the two pretend to date for some reason , but only after hart gives grenier a bath to turn him into a hunky stud . 

will grenier like his new popularity and turn on his friends ? 

will this crazy scheme work ? 

do i care ? 

the teen comedy resurgence of late has been surprisingly good in terms of comedy . 

what makes movies like can't hardly wait and 10 things i hate about you work ( and to a lesser extent , she's all that and never been kissed ) is because the writers of those films seem to realize that high school is a joke and write their scripts accordingly . 

i don't know what the writer's intention was with drive me crazy . 

there was some smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth getting to . 

here there's nothing . . . 

just teens whining about who's going to take them to the big dance . 

do me a favor kids , go get a job or something . . . 

just shut the hell up . 

in all honesty , the best part of this film is the end credits . 

now normally when i say that it's followed with the joke "" . . . because the movie is finally over . "" 

in this case though the end credits really are the most entertaining part of the film . 

after the obligatory second playing of britney spears' titular song , there's a quick commercial jingle for a burger joint the kids in the film hang out in and a brief rendition of the school song for their high school . 

nothing great , but more entertaining than anything in the 90 minutes which preceded them . 

sci-fi fans take note : there are brief appearances from stephen collins ( star trek : the motion picture ) and faye grant ( the tv miniseries "" v "" and "" v : the final battle "" ) .

"seen december 28 , 1997 at 8 : 45 p . m . at the crossgates mall cinema 18 ( guilderland , ny ) , theater #8 , with matt perreault and my sister jena for free ( matt paid using pre-paid passes ) . 

if there's ever been an exception to the perils of excessive cliches and non- stop action , the james bond films are it . 

and if there's ever been a james bond film that not only proves this , but does so by pushing it to the extreme , "" tomorrow never dies "" is it . 

opening sequences almost always make or break action films . 

when done properly , not only are they actually exciting , but they foreshadow things to come . 

this film starts off on the right foot by establishing the kind of atmosphere that could only be found in an action movie , but with a sense of the self-aware , enclosed universe where james bond movies take place in . 

first there's a high-tech , slightly complicated scene involving a british warship crossing into unfriendly , chinese waters . 

there's definite tension as there seems to be an unknown , but certainly hostile , third party involved who is manipulating both sides . 

when the scene ends in tragedy , it's clear there's some kind of powerful conspiracy going on , and who else to call on for such a case but james bond ? 

the film uses good judgment in the way it introduces us to bond ( brosnon ) . 

as the enemy was portrayed as evil and mysterious , bond is clearly ( and obviously ) depicted as an out-and-out hero . 

he single-handedly takes out a small army of terrorists , and then must escape in the nick of time by flying away in a fighter jet while the co-pilot tries to strangle him and a terrorist in another jet tries to shoot him down ! 

this might sound like the kind of cliches films like this are notorious for ( over- ) using , but it works here because the film knows how to get our attention quickly . 

it's not about the payoff because it's obvious bond will escape , instead , it's the way it processes the action sequences by going over the top and not apologizing for it , all the while creating for witty , hysterical comedy . 

it seems less emphasis is placed on the villains in thrillers anymore , because of political correctness , and just plain copping-out on behalf of the filmmakers ( even the term "" villain "" sounds passe ) . 

what the film deserves kudos for is its ability to create a villain as heinous as they come , yet making him seem completely plausible . 

jonathon pryce delivers a perfect performance as the arrogant , cunning elliot carver , a media mogul whose goal is to take over the world , that is , through his massive media empire , not through nuclear weapons . 

through some interesting detective work , bond and the english ministry of defense believe carver is behind the trouble brewing in the southern asian seas as a way to create and accurately cover his own news . 

not only is that an original idea for a conflict , but one which could carry over into reality . 

surprisingly , this is about as detailed as the story allows the specific plot to become . 

the film's hook is the action , and of course those cool gadgets and we get plenty of that here as bond goes out to investigate carver and finds himself in a jam or two along the way . 

the story works much like bond himself - always on the run and concentrates more on the individual conflicts than any general plot . 

somehow a chinese agent , wai lin ( yeoh ) , bumps into bond a few too many times and they find themselves working together . 

the chemistry between brosnon and yeoh is rigid , but also works because of this , not in spite of it . 

the two are constantly on the run from carver and his goons , yet the film manages to balance the stunts and special effects with its clever story . 

although "" tomorrow never dies "" is far from perfect , it is quite an impressive film in terms of its ability to be so cliche and cartoony and not make plausibility an issue .

the leader of harold's planet ( ben kingsley ) tells him to marry her , and harold is soon exposed to all the "" joys "" of married life . 

despite its title and premise which seem to imply that this is some jerry lewis vehicle from the late 1960s , what planet are you from ? 

is a very funny movie . 

the plot ( which the film wisely doesn't linger on the specifics of for too long ) is of course nothing more than framework for the jokes , most of which work very well . 

the material may be considered crude and tasteless by many , and i might have thought so as well had shandling not been the lead . 

but he brings a sort of pathetic charm to the role , and it's his performance that makes the film truly funny instead of just offensive . 

plus if you think about it , what planet are you from ? 

could have very easily gone the gross-out route ( considering that shandling's character is given a detachable penis that vibrates and hums when he gets excited ) . 

we never see anything though , it's all implied , which gives the film a touch of class amidst its crudeness . 

i'm glad to see that someone in hollywood still understands the concept of "" less is more "" . 

the talented supporting cast certainly adds to one's enjoyment of this film . 

annette bening ( oddly playing a merged version of her real estate salesman character from american beauty and her ditzy spiritualist character from mars attacks ! ) 

does a fine job keeping up with shandling and makes a good catalyst for his brand of humor . 

she even manages to pull off a potentially disastrous scene where she has to perform a rather goofy rendition of "" high hopes "" for a lengthy period of time . 

ben kingsley , john goodman and greg kinnear all fare well in their performances as well , and linda fiorentino . . . 

good lord , there should be some sort of law stating that no woman can be that sexy . 

everything about her character in this film oozes raw sexuality . 

what planet are you from ? 

is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video . 

the disc gives you the choice of either watching the film full frame or in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( and enhanced for 16x9 televisions . 

also included on the disc as extras : a decent making-of featurette , an isolated score track , talent files for the cast and crew , and the film's original theatrical trailer ( as well as trailers for wolf , men in black , bugsy and as good as it gets ) . 

when i first saw that the disc featured an isolated score track , i actually laughed . 

how great could the music for a silly little comedy be for it to get it's own isolated track ? 

well as it turns out , it's a mighty fine score from carter burwell ( fargo , the hudsucker proxy ) that i enjoyed listening to again while i typed up this review . 

kudos to columbia tristar for adding that feature to the disc . 

what planet are your from ? 

was unjustly ignored in theaters , and i hope it finds its deserved audience on home video . 

this fine dvd is certainly a great way to see it .

"synopsis : original "" jurassic park "" survivor alan grant ( neill ) is tricked by paul and amanda kirby ( macy and leoni ) into leading an expedition to an island overrun by dinosaur , to rescue their stranded son . 

grant's team is picked off one by one as they encounter dinosaurs both new and familiar , and grant grows to realise that some breeds are more intelligent than he previously thought . 

review : there is one reason why "" jurassic park iii "" is better than its immediate predecessor , "" the lost world : jurassic park "" . 

the latter wasted 129 minutes of my life ; the former , only 94 . 

the first "" park "" was a marvellous film , full of awe-inspiring sights , interesting characters , and genuine thrills . 

its two successors have been pale imitations , amounting to hundred-million-dollar b-grade horror movies . 

at least this third entry realises it ; whereas "" the lost world "" tried to justify its existence with a ludicrous and overextended plot , "" jurassic park iii "" simply sticks its characters on an island with a bunch of dinosaurs and lets the mayhem begin . 

there is a desperate sense of deja vu presiding over this movie ; the computer-animated dinos are no longer novel or exciting , and even the first-time presence of aerial lizards scarcely improves the situation . 

remember that wondrous first trolley ride through the park in the original movie ? 

nothing in this rehash even comes close . 

add in execrable dialogue from screenwriters buchman , payne and taylor , and phoned-in performances by the normally capable macy and leoni , and it is difficult to recommend the film to anyone but dino enthusiasts . 

at least neill makes some effort to retain the dignity of his character , and there is much less gore than in "" the lost world "" , making this installment more suitable for children . 
"
"plot : a down-and-out girl moves in with some over-the-top models and falls in love with a goofy-but-loveable guy from across the street . 

aaaaaaaaah ! 

then one day , she sees him knock a woman upside the head with a baseball bat . 

ooooooooh ! 

she must then join together with her model-friends to find out whether or not this guy is really goofy-but-loveable , or a psycho killer . 

aaaaaaaaah ! 

critique : completely idiotic . 

okay , so maybe i'm being a little too nice . 

this movie starts off dumb , moves into the ridiculous and eventually graduates to idiocy . 

there . . . that's 

more like it ! 

and how , you may ask ? 

well , it's simple really . 

four of the dumbest stereotypical models in the world ( oh my god , i just found out that the actresses playing the parts are models in real life . . . yipes ! ) 

join monica potter ( in a role which can only be described as an obvious cry for help ) and freddie prinze jr . ( not the actor , but the character better known as freddie prinze jr . ) , in a plot so stupid and far-fetched , that you have to wonder once more , how crap like this gets by the hollywood bigwigs . 

this thing stinks to high-heaven . 

it's just plain embarrassing for everyone involved . 

i even felt my iq dip below its usual low as toilet humor somehow worked its way into this so-called romantic-comedy-action movie ? 

ugh . 

what a pile of dung . 

hey , i'm actually starting to sound a little like harry knowles here , but i guess i could see where his frustration comes from time to time . 

it's sad really . 

a movie which actually had quite a few people in my audience laughing at its idiocy , including the over-used "" folks hiding in the bathroom while someone else comes in to take a crap and fart "" gag . 

and how about that dumb blonde model who keeps running into things . 

pure hilarity ! 

or maybe i'm just too jaded , too much of a critic , not relaxed enough to enjoy this fluff-piece . . . uuuhhmmm . . . naaaaah ! ! 

this movie sucks the big one . 

it's chockfull of stupid characters delivering inane dialogue fitting snuggly into a preposterous plot . 

this is the kind of movie that has one character inserting another character into a car headfirst to the floor only because . . . well , 

it's supposed to be funny , see ? 

you see , that person then has their legs swinging in the other person's face as they drive and that distracts the driver , see , and well , that's kinda funny , no ? 

harumph . . . yeah , 

well . . . you 

get the picture ! 

anyhoo , freddie prinze jr . . . . nuff 

said . 

monica potter , a bad career move , but we might forgive you if you keep up the julia roberts bit . 

the rest of the model girls . . . well , 

thanks for being there so i had something to look at , but please apologize to the entire modeling community as a whole , for making them all out to be complete imbeciles ! ! 

so why the three points out of ten , you may ask ? 

well , it's simple really . 

one point goes to the russian model girl and that cool accent ( don't ask me why , but it actually turned me on ) . 

one point goes out to all of the model girls for being in the movie ( nice window decoration . . . natch ! ) . 

and one last point goes out to the makers of this film , who spared us any long sorted story , and made sure to give us the opportunity of leaving the theatre after only 90 minutes of manufactured garbage , so that we could run out as fast as we can , grab the next person that we see walking down the street and warn them of the devil that is . . . freddie prinze jr . . . i 

mean , head over heels . 

you've been warned , good people . 

ps : didja notice how i didn't even mention rear window once in my entire review ? 

i didn't want to taint the memory of the classic flick by having it uttered alongside this thing , but then again , i just did mention it , but i guess it doesn't count in the ps section . . . or 

does it ? 

ooooh , whatever . . . i have a headache ! 

 ( i think my brain is coming back to life ) 

where's joblo coming from ? 

10 things i hate about you ( 7/10 ) - coyote ugly ( 6 . 5/10 )

"it might surprise some to know that joel and ethan coen , who have brought such unabated lunacy to our movie screens as "" raising arizona "" and "" the hudsucker proxy , "" made their feature film debut with "" blood simple , "" a grim and often gruesome tale of revenge , murder , and literally fatal misconceptions in rural texas . 

it bears some resemblance , story-wise , to the coens' recent "" fargo , "" but even the darkly satirical humor and the enjoyably quirky characterizations that characterized that film are scarce here ; "" blood simple "" is pretty much cold and brutal from beginning to end . 

the premise of "" blood simple "" is really just a slight variation on the standard love-triangle/revenge scheme : sleazy bar owner julian marty ( dan hedaya ) hires a shifty private detective ( m . 

emmet walsh ) to kill his wife abby ( frances mcdormand ) and her illicit lover ray ( john getz ) . 

things start to go haywire when walsh decides instead to fake the murder with photographic trickery but , upon collecting the money , becomes uncertain as to whether or not marty is capable of keeping his mouth shut about the scheme . 

to reveal any more details of the story would be to give away too much , but what ensues is a series of bloody ( and i do mean bloody ) confrontations , each triggered by one or more characters misunderstanding what is actually happening . 

every act of violence or deception in this film makes sense when seen through the perpetrator's eyes , but we , the audience , are made privy to the "" big picture "" and thus can recognize that each misdeed is somehow either unnecessary or directed at the wrong person . 

this aspect of the story , along with the intense atmosphere of repulsion and brutality - one gets the sense that if guns and , in one case , shovels , were not available , some of these characters would claw each other to death - are the most effective components of the film . 

the coens might have done well to title the film "" fear and loathing in texas . "" 

some have labeled "" blood simple as a modern-day noir , but , while i am not an expert on either genre , it seems more like a horror movie than anything else . 

the coens seem much more interested in the plot twists and the atmosphere of confusion and paranoia than they do in the characters , and the final sequence is nothing more than a showdown between the one ( relatively ) innocent character and the only one of the murderers left alive . 

that said , "" blood simple "" is a very good horror movie ; the fear and suspense here are genuine . 

the coens also add plenty of quirky touches that nudge the weirdness meter upwards , such as when a character enters an empty room and accidentally steps on a gun , discharging it as it skitters across the floor , or when a murder attempt unfolds in a way such that abby mistakes her attacker for another character who has in fact been killed earlier in the film . 

that said , "" blood simple "" is not exactly flawless . 

for one thing , the motivations for the killings are still a little thin at times ; i can understand that the characters had tracks to cover ( or at least thought they did ) , but i found it a little hard to accept that all of them would so quickly resort to murder . 

and although they at least didn ? t have anyone get hacked to death with a knife , the coens also aren't quite immune to horror cliches ; they indulge in a prolonged dead-guy-seems-to-have-come-back-to-life-but-then-we-find-out-it's-only-a-dream scene that had me rolling my eyes . 

the film also ends so quickly after the final confrontation that i found myself wondering if they had simply run out of film . 

 "" blood simple "" is not quite the masterpiece of neo-noir that many seem to think it is , but it's a decent movie and it showcases the coens' ability to handle suspense and violence in a visceral but non-exploitative manner . 

i would firmly recommend it to all "" coen-heads "" as well as anyone looking for something original in a thriller . 
"
"this is the first film in what would become the most successful series of horror films of all time . 

a fair warning to those of you who might be inclined to watch this movie for the first appearance of everyone's favorite goalie-mask-wearing homicidal maniac . 

jason , the guy who single handedly controlled the overpopulation problem around the crystal lake area , doesn't start his quest to find the most interesting household item with which to kill someone until the sequel . 

while he does have a small role in this film , we the audience have to depend on another blood thirsty maniac to rack up the body count . 

the plot , like every other friday the 13th movie goes something like this -- crazed killer murders as many unsuspecting teenagers as he/she/it possibly can in the space of a 90 minute movie . 

the reasons that the afore mentioned unsuspecting teenagers come into contact with the bloodthirsty killer are usually of little importance to the story . 

but for those of you out there that might actually care about such trivial matters in a movie such as a plot , here are the basics . 

a bunch of unsuspecting teens get a summer job at a long closed summer camp . 

they are days away from the arrival of the kids and they are spending their time fixing the place up and making sure it is ready for the kids . 

sadly , they start being butchered one by one by the bloodthirsty killer . 

at this point i would usually say something about the quality of acting , directing or maybe something about the high quality of the production . 

since i'm not going to do that , feel free to assume that if i did , it wouldn't be positive . 

i will say that this movie looks as if it was made for about a hundred bucks , and that includes the actors' salaries . 

if you are used to recent horror films like scream , you are in for a bit of a surprise . 

the only saving grace for friday the 13th is that it was really the first of its kind , with the killer taking real pride in their work . 

using as many methods of murder as they could . 

none of this single murder weapon stuff life that unimaginative leatherface in chainsaw massacre , or the creatively stifled imagination of halloween's michael myers who just used brute force or a really big kitchen knife . 

nope , in the friday the 13th movies , you can always count on the killer taking great pride in his work . 

one fun fact about this movie is that the cast includes a very young kevin bacon , although after this movie it is a wonder he ever worked again . 

the main reason to see friday the 13th is if you want to watch all of the series from the beginning . 

if not , stick with the later films with jason , everyone's favorite hockey fan . 

friday the 13th is the sort of movie that is fun to sit down and get a couple of scares from , just don't sit down expecting a whole lot . 
"
" ( note : there are spoilers regarding the film's climax ; the election , of course ) 

we see matthew broderick , a man torn to a primal state ; he's been unfaithful to his wife , lied to and manipulated his students , and by the same token they've demeaned his masculinity , his self-respect , his desperate attempt at changing the world . 

and yet , he equates the cause of his pain , his torment , with tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) . 

no matter how many students have come and gone , and disappointed him as an educator , she's the real threat . 

about to give in , and divulge that she's won by only a lone vote , broderick's mccalister turns in defeat , sees tracy's euphoric celebration in the outside corridor and says , 'no' . 

the fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men , no matter how obscure , have in their relationships ; a traditional expectation of success , to usurp and surpass women as a proverbial industry . 

she can't go higher than him . 

he won't allow it . 

and what's amazing about "" election "" is that every word of that criticism is drawn from a rather opaque metaphor . 

early in the film we learn that tracy was romantically , and then sexually , involved with a now departed teacher . 

it's like payne and taylor , his co-screenwriter , have taken tracy , a girl desperate for friendship , loyalty , and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers , that they found sitting at the teachers' lunch table more fitting , to an unlikely extreme with her as the protagonist . 

and it's amazing the compassion that we have ; it seems so real to us , and not merely because it's happened before , splashed all over the front pages , but , because of the all around "" nice "" persona of these people , we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters . 

it's with mandy barnett's "" if you'll be the teacher "" playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most ; a final , viscous injection of bittersweet irony . 

sexuality , though , is not the only basis for payne's satire , or its success . 

it also makes a telling point about politics , friendship , and class boundaries . 

satire is required ( or ought to be , anyway ) to take itself seriously , or act so , while the audience does not . 

it's a fine line to straddle , but some films ignore it altogether ( "" drop dead gorgeous "" leaps infuriatingly to mind ) . 

payne and taylor hit the right chord ; their characters are real people : neither is perfect , but rather both of the leads are flawed , misguided individuals who retain , somewhat , noble intentions at heart . 

we sympathize with them , but still , as a satire , their idiosyncratic behavior , and their wrongdoing , is taken to an extreme for the audience to knowingly chuckle , but also reflect and meditate , about . 

minus half a point , though , for payne admitting not to having seen "" ferris bueller's day off "" . 

whatever . 
"
"it shows that america remains ambivalent over the nature of its political system . 

no major surprise , when j . s . mill in his victorian classic on liberty could not make up his mind over liberal democracy either . 

the americans are wrought by the archetypal paradox under which they exist , the supreme contradiction between the right of the one and the right of the majority . 

small wonder that hollywood's most compelling movies have oft been on the struggle of the individual-underdog against some larger collective oppressive - witness braveheart , born on the fourth of july , rocky , first blood , clear and present danger , jfk , the list goes on . 

there's little of that in singapore - we are barred access to playboy and penthouse both on and off line , though the government's been long worried about the younger people getting "" americanised "" and advocating individual rights and parliamentary opposition . 

the people vs . larry flynt locates the political debate within the greatest social taboo in america - sex . 

does pornography have a right to exist and circulate ? 

larry flynt , the publisher of hustler magazine , thinks so , and obviously so too the u . s . congress which last month threw out a bill to curb pornography on the net . 

but even with such actions , americans remain undecided . 

the oscars apparently shunned the movie because it was an embarrassing and sensitive livewire . 

what they have ignored is actually a great picture . 

woody harrelson as the lead character reprises his role as a to-hell-with-morality , to-hell-with-the-law , and to-hell-with-the-system anti-christ that we last saw in natural born killers . 

and he is outrageous and convincing as a nihilistic atheist who nonetheless loves his ex-stripper wife dearly . 

the latter is played with abandon , conviction and sensitivity all at once by courtney love , who is the real star of the show and really snubbed of an academy award best actress nomination , if not of the award itself . 

edward norton plays their jerky lawyer . 

the relationship between harrelson and love brings out another great paradox - superficially they are immoral outcasts who've had it coming ; woody gets shot and becomes paralysed from the waist down , and courtney dies of aids . 

god's damnation . 

but in the powerful love they have for each other , each standing by the other in turn , the two leads highlight the question how much is the nihilist still a moralist and ( in the american context ) a christian , if they can love and care , and feel just like anyone else on a personal level . 

friedrich nietzsche once talked about how the atheist must uncover for himself the full consequences of atheism by ridding himself of all moral-christian influences . 

to go beyond good and evil . 

this is a great picture , no doubt , and i love it personally . 

because it is moving , funny , ends with open american optimism blah blah . 

but i like it and admire it because it comes from a fine american tradition that dares to raise difficult questions , and call into doubt ideas and doctrines that otherwise are used as catchphrases . 

there are times when movies go beyond the story they tell and reflect something of hidden realities . 

this movie is not so much about larry flynt , but about americans and american society . 
"
"when respecting a director , you must also respect the fact that they are not perfect . 

woody allen has made a couple less-than good films , and he's my favorite . 

even martin scorsese hasn't had a perfect track record . 

kevin smith , after a smashing debut with the classic "" clerks "" stooped as low to sell-out and make the dreadful "" mallrats . "" 

i mean , so far the only director who's made several films , none of which have been bad is richard linklater ( "" slacker , "" "" dazed and confused , "" "" before sunrise , "" and "" suburbia "" . . . all 

which were great ) . 

now , i adore quentin tarantino . 

his first two films were classic films , the second one being one of the greatest films of all time . 

but 1995 just wasn't that good of a year for him . 

he made way too many tv appearances . 

he mispronounced jackie chan's name on the mtv movie awards . 

and he made this film . 

 ( he was also awarded an oscar , so i guess that would be a grand exception ) . 

robert rodriguez is also a great director ; not a brilliant one , but a cool one . 

i've never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders film , so i can't comment on them . 

but in this crap ensemble director's film , all four give pitiful efforts . 

pitiful for any director , too . 

now in all fairness , ensemble director pieces never really work out . 

i've never seen all of "" new york stories , "" but have heard the first two films , by scorsese and francis ford coppola are crap ( i saw woody's one , which was hilarious but not totally up to par ) . but i will rate each film individually and then report back to you on the overal average score of the film . 

exposition : a simple one - a bellhop , ted ( the totally overdone tim roth , who's a god and all , but not in this one , though he has a couple good moments ) is working on new year's eve for his first shift ( ! ! ! ) in an old fancy hotel . 

he's the only one there ( again : ! ! ! ) and he only has a couple rooms ( yet again : ! ! ! ) . 

the old bellhop ( the seemingly immortal marc lawrence - who hated pulp fiction actually ) hands over his cap to ted and he goes to his job happily . 

as the night goes on , he becomes increasingly annoyed and hostile . 

yea . 

 ( the short films are presented in order , btw ) : 

the missing ingredient writer/director : allison anders starring : sammi davis , amanda decadenet , valeria golino , madonna , ione skye , lili taylor , alicia witt 

this one starts it off horribly with no plot , no intrigue , and crap dialogue . 

the situation is so terrible that it's physically painful to watch . 

the plot has something to do with a coven of witches needing sperm to bring back a godess who is ( gasp ! ) 

stuck inside some object in their hotel room . 

the witch that was supposed to bring it ( ione skye ) calls up ted and asks him if she can perform fellatio on him to get it . 

yeah , that's what i said . 

stupid plot , inane characters who aren't interesting at all , etc , etc , etc . the only good thing about this is it has a good cast which , in turn , it wastes pitifully . 

not even actually funny for a second . 

my rating ( out of 5 ) : no stars ! ! ! ! 

the wrong man writer/director : alexandre rockwell starring : david proval , jennifer beals and laurence bender 

another bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on . 

ted stumbles into the wrong room or something and gets in the middle of a couple ( david proval and jennifer beals in her attempt at "" coming back "" ) who are playing sex games . 

ted tries to escape and we cheer him on so it will end soon . 

but at least this has a bit of comedy in it , just not that much . 

and david proval has never overacted as much . 

and it's "" pulp fiction "" producer laurence bender who gets to puke from a window . 

a masterpiece compared to the first one , but still . . . 

the misbehavers writer/director : robert rodriguez starring : antonio banderes , tamlyn tomita , lana mckissack , danny verduzco , salma hayek 

would a robert rodriguez film be the same without salma hayek's navel ? 

nope . 

luckily she's on the tv dancing so we get to see her . 

surprisingly enough , when i read the screenplay ( about a year before actually seeing it ) , this one seemed to have the most potential . 

it was fast-paced , funny , and well , funny . 

but when i watched it , it seemed anti-climactic and only seemed to gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened at once . 

antonio overacts nicely and the two kids ( lana and danny ) are funny . 

but , as i said , it moves slowly and in that way , it's more painful than funny . 

but the ending was stupid and funny at the same time . 

oh ! 

the plot : antonio is a supposed gangster ( assumed , really ) who leaves his two troubling kids home while he and his wife ( tomita ) go out to get drunk at a new year's party . 

antonio hires ted for a couple bucks to watch his kids all night long , but things go wrong . . . it 

was okay . 

the man from hollywood writer/director : quentin tarantino starring : quentin tarantino , bruce willis , paul calderon and jennifer beals ( again ) 

ironically , this one could be considered the best for a bad reason : it best represents what quentin has done with this film . 

he plays chester , a spoiled brat actor or something who has just had a huge box-office hit on his hands and is living it up by playing an anti-climactic game from a hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen and peter lorre where they gamble to see if one of them can get light from his lighter ten times in a row . 

they're drunk and need sober but nervous ted to hold the cleaver and bring it down if the lighter doesn't light . 

they also pay him a lot of cash . 

this is so much exactly what this little film is about that it's campy . 

tim roth was probably payed a lot of money to do this stupid part in this stupid film made by a bunch of people who are high on themselves 'cause they've had hits , major or minor . 

it took quentin to realize that . 

but the thing is , it doesn't seem like he realizes that . 

if he did , i'd give this a good 3 stars . 

but this sucked . 

it was anti-climactic and the dialogue wasn't very good . 

he starts off with a very long steadicam shot then goes to flashes . 

that makes no sense . 

it's cool for a while , then he makes it uneven . 

it's long and it's just not very good . 

hopefully quentin never repeats what he did with this one . 

conclusion : what's the moral here ? 

if you've made celebrated films , don't do an ensemble piece . 

they should have re-watched "" new york stories "" and then stopped in their tracks . 

none of these have any point to them and they're embarrassing to not only the writer/directors , but to the actors 'cause they're working with crap . 

but i will forgive everyone involved and i especially look forward to quentin's next directing job ( even though he and rodriguez jumped back to the top immeadiately with the cool "" from dusk till dawn , "" which i found exhilerating ) . 

i love quentin and i suppose it's good he made "" the man from hollywood "" because it makes him seem more realistic and not some "" god of cinema . "" 

i seem to respect directors if they aren't "" gods "" and are actually human beings who make mistakes . 

 "" the man from hollywood "" is his big mistake and let's hope he doesn't return her continuously . 
"
"call me crazy , but i don't see saving private ryan as the film of the summer . 

a good movie , yes , with chillingly realistic battle scenes and emotion to spare . 

an utterly riviting movie on par with steven spielberg's best work , no . 

personally , if i was spielberg , i wouldn't go back to the world war ii era one more time after schindler's list and the indiana jones movies . 

i'm guessing steve has a thing for nazis ; i really wouldn't be surprised if a velociraptor ate one of the swastika-wearing dudes in the next jurassic park movie . 

all lofty pretenses aside , saving private ryan is the goriest movie this side of a 1980s slasher flick . 

the difference is , it's easy during friday the 13th to laugh off a spear sticking out of kevin bacon's chest while blood spurts like crazy , but it's damn hard to sit and eat reese's pieces while soldiers suffer machine gun bullets to the head and have their intestines spilled out onto the battlefield . 

and believe me , there's plenty of it . 

a 30-minute sequence at the beginning of the movie has an army captain ( tom hanks ) and his soldiers landing at omaha beach to join countless other americans who are already under fire . 

lives are lost in seconds as the purposefully confusing and jarring scene goes on and on , and all the young men in the audience find themselves never , ever wanting to be drafted . 

cut to some bureaucratic defense office , where a hundred women pound out sympathy form letters to the families of the casualties . 

one woman happens upon an interesting detail -- three brothers in different platoons were killed in combat , and their mother is getting the telegram today . 

i guess it's an interesting conversation piece to everyone but the mother , so the army chief ( harve presnell ) sends hanks on what is essentially a public relations mission , to find the fourth ryan brother and send him home . 

that way , the army saves the postage on yet another telegram to mrs . ryan . 

one good thing about saving private ryan is that the soldiers who are headed to rescue ryan know it's a mission designed to make the army look good . 

they question the worth of risking eight soldiers' lives to save one , and hanks' character admits he doesn't give a damn about ryan ; he's just following orders . 

if this was a john wayne movie , things would be different . 

there'd be a phony , "" let's go get that boy , gosh darn it ! "" 

attitude that would sugarcoat the reality of war . 

by doing things this way , spielberg admits the instincts of self- preservation and complacency that every normal person has . 

it makes saving private ryan a lot more powerful than an testosterone-driven stallone movie mission . 

the movie's pattern is to have long battle scenes followed by quiet scenes of semi-introspective conversation among the soldiers . 

hanks is painted first as a nails-tough army man careful to hide his true self from the other men . 

it's not that way for long . 

edward burns , the guy you get for your movie when ben affleck isn't available , is the impulsive one . 

jeremy davies plays the translator who is seeing combat for the first time , and so on . 

none of the characters are fascinating or natural born heroes , but was spielberg's obvious intention . 

i wondered when i heard saving private ryan was three hours long , how were they going to fill three hours' time searching for one person and still make it interesting ? 

there are a few false starts ; hanks finds one private ryan in ted danson's company ( apparently , danson joined the army after "" ink "" was canceled . ) and breaks the bad news before learning it's the wrong ryan . 

and of course the movie's far from over when hanks does locate ryan ( matt damon , the other guy you get when affleck isn't available ) . 

that's when the movie turns into more of a conventional war flick , although body parts and limbs still fly like never before . 

saving private ryan is worth your time , but it's definitely no schindler's list . 

the battle scenes are intense and realistic , but some of the attempts at sincere emotion aren't . 

the movie's bookends are particularly cheesy and out of place , when an old private ryan goes to the cemetary with his family and bawls his eyes out , whining , "" tell me i've led a good life . 

tell me i'm a good man . "" 

spielberg was apparently following the james cameron line of thought that any three-hour movie about the past should be framed by a self-contained prologue and epilogue that takes place in the present . 

much more effective are subtler scenes , like the one where several of hanks' men are rifling thrugh a bag of dogtags from dead soldiers , and they make light of what they're doing by pretending they're playing poker . 

this while an airborne division marches by , their eyes full of that mound of dogtags . 

by not explicitly pointing out that it symbolizes the random poker game that life and death can be in war , the audience gets the message . 

and even if it's not a classic , saving private ryan is definitely one of the better war movies out there .

"reading the cast and director for the new mobster comedy , "" analyze this , "" i asked myself , "" how could this miss ? "" 

robert de niro ( "" taxi driver , "" "" raging bull "" ) , billy crystal ( "" city slickers "" ) , lisa kudrow ( "" the opposite of sex "" ) , and director harold ramis ( "" national lampoon's vacation "" ) . 

these are usually reliable filmmakers ( well , okay , crystal has been in a sizable slump lately ) , and tellingly , the first half-hour of "" analyze this "" was very funny . 

unfortunately , as the running time ticked away , i began to think that the first thirty minutes had , unbeknownst to me , been rewound and were being replayed another two-and-a-half times . 

the film has obtained a clever premise , but does not have any idea what to do with it as it progressively becomes more and more repetitive until i finally stopped enjoying or caring about what was happening on the screen . 

middle-aged psychoanalyst ben sobel's ( billy crystal ) life is finally going very well . 

although he has never gotten along with his own uncaring parents , especially his father , who is also a psychiatrist , ben has an easy-going teenage son ( kyle sabihy ) and is about to travel down to miami to get married to his tv news reporter girlfriend , laura ( lisa kudrow ) . 

in little but a flash , however , ben suddenly sees his plans ruined when he accidentally hits the car of the mob and subsequently gets paid a visit from famed mafia guy paul vitti ( robert de niro ) , who desperately wants counseling , even though he himself won't even admit to having anxiety attacks . 

ben tries to help paul , mostly so he will get him off his back , but the plot gets more complicated when paul follows ben to his wedding , which ends with a man dropping eight stories to his death . 

it seems to ben that no matter what he does , paul vitti will not go away , and the more they become involved , the more ben's potentially happy life gets into danger . 

 "" analyze this "" has a few laughs sprinkled throughout ( mostly in the first half ) , but i always had the nagging thought that what director ramis and writers peter tolan , ramis , and kenneth lonergan had done was thought of one joke ( robert de niro lightly spoofing his serious past mafia roles , while terrorizing and becoming buddies with comic billy crystal ) and then tiresomely recycled it for the duration of the 106-minute running time . 

admittedly , de niro is very funny here ( and i can't remember the last time you could use that adjective to describe him ) , and crystal is in top-form , but the whole movie is weighed down directly on their shoulders with nothing else to support them , including a substantial plotline . 

since "" analyze this "" bills not one , not two , but three writers , you'd think that they would have been able to work together to fix the noticably large flaws , but they must have all been on auto-pilot . 

one of the most disappointing and wasted opportunities in the film is the way the movie deals with the supporting characters , all of which have next to nothing to do and aren't even given multi-dimensional characters to attempt to develop . 

coming off of her oscar-caliber work in two of last year's best films , "" clockwatchers "" and "" the opposite of sex , "" lisa kudrow's throwaway "" girlfriend "" role is an incredible step down . 

sure , kudrow's fellow "" friend "" jennifer aniston did the same thing two weeks ago in "" office space , "" but at least we got to spend a little time with aniston . 

kudrow , meanwhile , mostly just stands around , no doubt wondering why she agreed to appear in this film in the first place . 

chazz palminteri , as rival gangster primo , fares even worse , in a role that plays more like an afterthought than an actual character . 

finally , molly shannon ( rising film star and cast member on "" saturday night live "" ) has a rousingly hilarious one-scene cameo right at the beginning as one of crystal's patients and then completely disappears . 

too bad , considering that the supporting actors surely have proven that they have the abilities to support de niro and crystal . 

once "" analyze this "" approached its second wedding scene leaving kudrow's laura standing alone at the altar once again , i had become thoroughly annoyed by where the story had gone , and had mostly lost respect for the character we were supposed to sympathize with the most , ben . 

afterwards , the climactic scene with ben posing as a fellow mob boss in place of the depressed paul , became a real laugh-free dead-zone , losing its last remaining comic punches . 

 "" analyze this "" proves that talent can certainly help any film out , but when the written material isn't up to their level , what we are virtually left with is a vacuum of thin air .

"what do you get when you combine clueless and dumb and dumber ? 

to answer the question , you get director david mirkin's new comedy romy and michele's high school reunion . 

romy white ( mira sorvino , mighty aprhodite ) and michele weinberger ( lisa kudrow , tv's friends ) have been inseparable buddies since they graduated from sagebrush high in 1987 . 

however , when former classmate heather mooney ( janeane garafolo , the truth about cats and dogs ) confronts romy about the 10 year reunion , she is astounded that she forgot . 

watching pretty woman for the um-teenth time , they are reminded of how they wouldn't let julia roberts' character shop in the expensive stores because of her appearance . 

then it hits them : they are not successful . 

what are she and michele going to do ? 

romy's instant solution is lose some weight off their already slender frames , "" bag a couple of boyfriends , "" and get jobs . 

romy says this will be easy , but michele retorts that if it is so easy , why hadn't they already done it . 

robin schiff's script keeps the show moving with some nice one-liners . 

one of the best has romy reminiscing about her life's battle against the bathroom scales . 

 "" i was so lucky getting mono , "" she says looking at her thinnest high school picture . 

 "" that was like the best diet ever . "" 

the casting for the film is so perfect that one begins to suspect that the leads were chosen and then the script was developed . 

romy and michele use their high school yearbook to discuss the caste system at their high school . 

the film's editor david finfer dissolves the stills from the yearbook to live action flashbacks which makes the past come to life . 

at sagebrush high , the hierarchy consisted of the a group ( cheerleaders ) , the b group ( drama club ) and the c group ( nerds ) . 

romy and michele were none of the above . 

ridiculed as "" the weirdoes , "" they were constant targets for abuse . 

even though they were quite attractive , they had so much fun being together that they did not care about the others . 

that they make their own outlandish clothes helped keep the wall around them . 

complementing romy and michele's lightness , is janeane garofalo as the dark , pudgy heather mooney . 

heather , who invented a new cigarette paper for cigarettes with "" twice the taste in half the time for the gal on the go , "" has the success and the money that they would like . 

heather was even more of an outsider than they were in high school . 

garofalo's one-dimensional role is only a side show . 

this is a two person film with the other characters there merely for the two leads to bounce their lines off of . 

the genuine chemistry between sorvino and kudrow makes for a sweet and sometimes touching comedy . 

they have so much fun acting out their parts , their enjoyment spreads to the audience .

"john carpenter makes b-movies . 

always has ( "" halloween , "" "" escape from new york , "" "" the thing "" ) and , by the looks of it ( "" they live , "" "" escape from l . a . , "" "" vampires "" ) , always will . 

carpenter's latest horror opus with a science fiction bent ( or science fiction outing with a schlock horror bent ) is the aptly-titled "" john carpenter's ghosts of mars "" ( in case , i suppose , you went looking for someone else's "" ghosts of mars "" ) . 

like all those films prefixed by the very possessive "" john carpenter's , "" "" ghosts of mars "" is an unashamed b-movie punctuated by a b-movie plot , b-movie actors , and b-movie special effects . 

in category one , above , we have a storyline that borders on idiotic ( and , at times , chaotic ) . 

dormant martians ( i . e . , swirling red gases ) awakened by meddling humans possess the souls of hapless mining colonists rendering them testy marilyn manson lookalikes . 

all this explained ( in flashback ) to some grand pooh-bah counsel by martian police official melanie ballard ( natasha henstridge , from the sub- "" species "" films ) , the only returnee on a silly-looking train . 

officer ballard went in to bring back incarcerated felon james "" desolation "" williams ; what she found was not a pretty picture . 

in the second category we have ms . henstridge , her blonde hair pulled back tightly and awkwardly into a ponytail , ice cube ( as the appropriately-named "" desolation "" ) , pam grier ( briefly , oddly--who wanted to work with whom i wonder ? ) , and a host of extras all assuming that the story and special effects were going to carry this film and therefore they didn't need to try too hard . 

in category number three we have , in addition to those swirling red gases and the silly-looking train , a couple of bird's-eye-view shots of a sprawling martian metropolis ( reddish also ) . 

state-of-the-art special effects have never been a carpenter trademark and once again the writer/director ( who seems to have no problem finding work , however ) doesn't waste any of the film's budget in that department . 

 "" ghosts of mars "" is lock , laughing stock , and barrel all your standard carpenter fare : dingy interiors , cluttered exteriors , inane dialogue , lots of leather , scarred , crazed-looking aliens , and lots and lots of weaponry . 

the film often and always explodes into warfare without warning--spontaneously , stupidly . 

carpenter might like to think he's made a western here but it's a western without any real heroes , villains , or border conflicts . 

it's just the shootouts minus a hissing snake plissken . 

i never thought i'd miss the guy but i do . 

it's not * all * the same , however . 

dubbed the "" one-note wonder "" for his minimalist music soundtracks , carpenter seems to have graduated from simplistic ( yet effective ) scoring by highlighting his action with loud , screeching guitar work . 

fortunately this drowns out a lot of the dialogue . 

the final exchange between henstridge and , er , cube though is both audible * and * priceless . 

mars has proven an infertile breeding ground for hollywood in the last year or so , what with the stillborn "" mission to mars "" and "" red planet "" ( with val kilmer ) . 

 "" ghosts of mars "" sadly adds to those disappointing returns ( in its opening weekend it was overshadowed by a bunch of sequels , among them "" american pie 2 "" and "" rush hour 2 "" ) . 

the irony is that the mars in carpenter's film feels sadly absent . 

there are occasional references to the red planet , of course , but the film might as well have been set in perth amboys than on earth's closest neighbor . 

two things keep "" john carpenter's ghosts of mars "" from getting a huge slap upside the head . 

1 . 

henstridge keeps her top on ( miraculously ) , and 2 . the film doesn't pretend to be anything it's not . 

what that means , however , is that fans of superior , intelligent , grade a sci-fi/horror are singularly out of luck .

"the blues brothers was a wonderful film , a hilarious comedy packed with good music . 

it cried out for a sequel , but john belushi's untimely death seemed to eliminate the idea . 

however , eighteen years have passed , and the long dormant sequel has finally emerged . 

unfortunately , it's a sequel not worthy of the original . 

the film starts exactly eighteen years after the first one ended . 

elwood blues ( dan aykroyd ) is just getting out of jail , his brother jake having recently died . 

as in the first film , he first visits mother mary stigmata ( kathleen freeman ) and then sets about getting the band back together . 

john belushi's absence leaves a terrible hole in the film , and although three new characters are created to fill the void , it is still very noticeable . 

first , there's cabel ( joe morton ) the illegitimate son of elwood's stepfather ( played by cab calloway in the first movie ) . 

cabel is reluctant to join his destiny , and spends most of the movie as an illinois sheriff , chasing the blues brothers band . 

next , there's mighty mack ( john goodman ) , a bartender who becomes the new lead singer of the band . 

finally , there's buster ( j . 

evan bonifant ) , a ten year old orphan who tags along with elwood and eventually joins the band . 

the plotting of the film is hardly original . . . it 

seems to be almost a clone of the original . 

elwood has to go to reluctantly retrieve each member of the band , they then travel , while being pursued by the police , and perform at several odd stops until they finally reach the big concert finale . 

the first film had neo-nazis as the random element , this time around , the russian mafia and a militia group fill their role . 

in fact , the duplication of the plot is so ridiculously complete that certain scenes are practically identical to the original . 

remember the classic performance at country bob's ( where they like both types of music : country and western ) from the first movie ? 

well , this movie has a performance at a country fair , where the band is expected to play bluegrass music . 

there's the massive police car pileup , although this time the gag falls completely flat . 

there's even an exact replica of the conversion scene in the church of reverend cleophus ( james brown ) . 

there are plenty of recurring characters too . 

in addition to mother stigmata and reverend cleophus , aretha franklin reprises her role as mrs . murphy . 

frank oz , a prison guard in the first film , makes an appearance here as the prison warden . 

as the stars , the new blues brothers don't live up to their legacy . 

aykroyd is more loquacious , yet much flatter as elwood . 

john goodman barely has a character as mighty mack . 

joe morton has the deepest character , but not a terribly interesting one , as cab . 

and what's the deal with the orphan ? 

it plays like a desperate gimmick that doesn't mesh at all with the rest of the film . 

at least bonifant isn't as precocious as he could have been in the role . 

but the true star , and the only saving grace , of the film is the music . 

and the film is packed with it ( even during and after the ending credits ) . 

although there are no brilliant mergers of comedy and song as in the original's rawhide/stand by your man medley , the music is very much enjoyable . 

to top it off , the film is packed to the gills with cameo musician appearances . 

b . b . king , blues traveler , eric clapton , travis tritt , wilson pickett , erykah badu , bo diddley and steve winwood are just a sampling of the multitude of stars that make an appearance here and there . 

unfortunately , the music pauses here and there to allow in the familiar plot . 

if simply copying the original blues brothers wasn't bad enough , writers aykroyd and john landis dumb it down , removing any memorable characters , and replacing them with flashy , but unbelievable , magical gimmicks . 

it's a shame . 

buy the soundtrack and avoid the film . 

better yet , rewatch the original . . . you'll 

have a much better time .

"deuce bigalow ( rob schneider ) cleans fish tanks . 

yeah , i didn't know that was a real job either . 

one of his customers is antoine leconte ( oded fehr ) , a successful gigolo . 

when antoine has to go to sweden for three weeks , he lets deuce use his house to look after an ailing $800 fish . 

fooling around , deuce sets fire to the kitchen and smashes a $6000 fish tank . 

after taking a try at one of antoine's clients and earning $10 , deuce decides to prostitute himself to raise the money to replace the fish tank before the fiery-tempered antoine returns . 

enter t . j . ( eddie griffin ) , a pimp for "" man-whores , "" who arranges for deuce to service an assortment of women whose imperfections keep them from dating . 

there's an enormous woman ( played by transvestite porn star chi chi la rue ) who hides food in her clothes . 

there's claire ( gail o'grady ) whose narcolepsy causes her to fall asleep every few minutes . 

tina ( torsten voges ) is so tall her face doesn't fit on the screen , and ruth ( amy poehler ) has tourette's syndrome and shouts obscenities without warning . 

finally there's kate ( arija bareikis ) whose sorority sisters secretly paid her fare . 

she seems perfect , and deuce quickly falls in love with her . 

 ( she does , we discover later , have an imperfection , but deuce decides it isn't important . ) 

deuce's life is complicated by a bothersome cop ( william forsythe ) looking for information on antoine and by kate's discovery of his man-whoring . 

however , neither threat generates much suspense . 

the formula is so familiar that we know how it will end from the start . 

 "" deuce bigalow "" is the first project from adam sandler's company happy madison , the formation of which assures that we'll be seeing the sandler style of comedy mass-produced at an increasing rate in years to come . 

be afraid . 

be very afraid . 

the good news is that sandler doesn't actually appear in "" deuce "" and that rob schneider and eddie griffin are funnier than sandler . 

schneider has a sweetness that makes the clueless but good-hearted deuce believable . 

griffin's delivery is dead-on , especially in the coining of "" technical terms "" for t . j . 's profession , as in "" don't make me he-bitch man-slap you ! "" 

there's the expected amount of toilet humor in "" deuce . "" 

 ( for one thing , deuce's dad is a men's room attendant ) . 

does anyone over the age of eight actually find bowel movements that funny ? 

for most of us , i think that childhood fascination with bodily functions disappears when we hit the far-side of puberty and discover how funny sex is . 

i , for one , will be glad when the toilet trend is finally flushed . 

bottom line : "" deuce "" doesn't offer anything new but it is intermittently funny . 
"
"if you've seen the trailers or commercials , it's rather difficult to really figure out what this movie has in store . 

well , it's hard to tell after watching the movie as well . 

bruce willis is a resident of the future , and it is a rather bleak future . 

the world's population had disintigrated into a mere 200 , 000 and is no longer ruled by humans but animals . 

the reason ? 

in 1995 , an organization called the army of the 12 monkeys contaminated the world with a pure virus , thus wiping out practically the world's population in a mere month . 

bruce willis' character is one of the surviving few , but is enslaved by scientists , as are most of last living humans . 

they barter his freedom by sending him on an assignment and having him do the ultimate task : go into the past , find the leader of the army of the 12 monkeys , and kill him . 

well , this explanation didn't come easy . 

although the movie is very thought provoking of us as a people , our future and the evilo in the world , as a story it is very confusing . 

and dragging . 

i know a movie isn''t keeping my interest when i fidget in my seat or feel the need to look at my watch only to find that it's only been an hour passed . 

terry gilliam has a certain style that i realize many appreciate , and i haven't watched his previous work brazil , but this movie felt like it took too long to tell and yet when one realizes the end is near because it is very easy to figure out , you wish it were more complex , and not to mention that the movie is depressing is the only reason why it did invoke emotion from me . 
"
"written by alex cox , tod davies , terry gilliam and tony grisoni 

directed by terry gilliam 

i've always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid . 

dropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded ; you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are , no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat , and no idea how long the ride will last . 

then there's the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychnine-laced dose . 

mushrooms , on the other hand , offer the psychedelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel : a steady , reassuring assent , a short period of thrilling motion and color , and then a smooth landing . 

acid is for daredevils ; mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy . 

my point is that in fear and loathing in las vegas , director terry gilliam has made an acid movie , when i wish he would have made a mushroom movie . 

full of shocking sight gags , aggressive images and grotesque comic performances , the film certainly offers something for those fans of hunter s . thompson's book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological world-view from the inside out . 

but for those of us who just want to enjoy a well-made film , gilliam has produced a mixed bag . 

fear and loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how self-professed "" gonzo "" journalist hunter s . thompson ( johnny depp ) and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta ( benicio del toro ) , came to las vegas to cover a motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of a district attorney's convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to a man of means in 1971 . 

operating under the pseudonyms of "" raoul duke "" and "" dr . 

gonzo "" , the two men careen into vegas on an acid and mescaline bender , then hole up in a hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite , cocaine , tequila and a rainbow of multi-colored uppers and downers . 

they terrorize every one they meet , mostly because every one they meet terrifies them . 

duke hallucinates giant bats on the way into town , then is attacked by horrifying lizards in the casino lounge . 

dr . gonzo becomes enamored of a thick-bladed hunting knife and begs duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just as jefferson airplane's "" white rabbit "" reaches its climax . 

and these guys don't just trash hotel rooms - they rape them , humiliate them and leave them for dead . 

that neither of them ends up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence , depending on your point of view . 

thompson's book , besides being a hilarious read , has stood the test of time as an important historical document . 

it simultaneously exposed the 60's drug culture for the sham that it was and exposed las vegas as the place where the american dream came to die . 

pontificate all you want about how the film illustrates thompson's message , but the truth is that , stripped to its bare essentials , what gilliam has wrought is a drug comedy . 

it's a cheech and chong movie . 

you're there to watch depp and del toro ingest a lot of chemicals and then laugh at the results : see johnny take drugs , see johnny fall down . 

there's nothing wrong with this concept , but gilliam tries too hard . 

this is a frantic movie - all sweaty close-ups , wide-angle lenses , dutch tilts and other-worldly lighting schemes . 

there are times when gilliam really does put a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen . 

but to what end ? 

much of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompson's book , and there are some priceless comic observations . 

but you're hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work . 

this brings us to the performances , which strike me as all wrong . 

depp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george c . scott in patton - a gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompson's dialogue . 

in between his several puking scenes , del toro fares better as dr . gonzo , but he also mumbles and sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost . 

watching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago , with dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads - now that would have been something to see . 

it's interesting to note that alex cox , credited as a co-writer on the screenplay , was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over . 

as much of a fan as i am of gilliam's work , cox would have been the better choice . 

sid and nancy , cox's best work , covered essentially the same subject matter , but cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film . 

gilliam commits the compound sin of over-directing his film while being uncertain of his purpose . 

what kind of movie was he trying to make , anyway ? 

it doesn't try to be a cautionary tale , and it doesn't work as broad comedy . 

if he had considered more carefully his purpose , the result would have been a much more interesting film . 

but i don't want to be too hard on it . 

there are some truly funny moments , and if you're in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it . 

i do , however , recommend watching fear and loathing in las vegas under the influence of your favorite controlled substance - i guarantee it will enhance the effect .

" "" return to horror high , "" wants to be a couple different types of movies at once . 

the film tells the story of a low-budget horror movie being filmed at the closed-down crippen high , a school where a group of serial murders took place five years before . 

but what the cast and crew don't know is that a real killer , maybe the same one that was never apprehended , is going into action again . 

on one level , "" return to horror high "" is a slasher movie , and it is at this level that it works the best on . 

watching the film , which was made in 1987 , i couldn't help but take notice that the killer's costume was almost identital to that of the ghostface in , "" scream , "" and "" scream 2 . "" 

on another level , the film wants to be a slapstick comedy , and there are many hints of this throughout . 

unfortunately , most of these jokes fall flat . 

and the last thing the film wants to be is a "" behind-the-scenes "" look at an exploitation film being made . 

the only problem is that , while much of it is supposed to be from the movie itself being made , no cameras are shown filming it , thus making it far more confusing than it had to be . 

and to top it all off , the "" twist "" ending makes very little to no sense whatsoever , and so we are basically left with feeling as if we wasted our time . 

there are story developments that are beyond ludicrous , and plot holes you could drive a winnebago through . 

if you see the film , or have seen it , you'll know what i mean . 

the premise of "" return to horror high , "" is admittedly pretty crafty , and i liked the atmosphere of the school , which is where the whole thing takes place . 

but director froehlich , judging from this movie , is an incompetent director , except for being able to film the seldom suspeneful scene . 

well , come to think of it , there is only one scene that is actually scary , and it has to do with two actors being locked in a room as the killer tries to break in . 

but other than that two-minute distraction , "" return to horror high , "" is certainly no great shake . 

note : look for george clooney in a supporting role as one of the actors on the film . 

and strangely enough , he is the first character to get the ax . . . literally .

"those print and television ads trumpeting that "" 'grease' is still the word "" are right on the money . 

to celebrate its 20th anniversary , this quintessential movie musical is getting the royal treatment reserved for classics like "" star wars "" -- a well-deserved , red-carpet rerelease . 

that's fantastic , especially when considering of all the classic characters and scenes the film has served up -- who can forget aspiring beautician frenchie ( didi conn ) being serenaded by her tell-it-like-it-is guardian angel ( frankie avalon ) ? 

or the hard-nosed principal ( eve arden ) reminding the student body to "" be an athletic supporter "" by rooting for the home team ? 

or national bandstand emcee vince fontaine ( edd byrnes ) flirting with marty ( a pre- "" empty nest "" dinah manhoff ) ? 

and these are all probably considered minor moments . . . 

a very skinny john travolta and a very young olivia newton-john have the respective leads of danny zuko and sandy olsson , and their pairing still ranks as one of screendom's most effervescently charming . 

for those eight of you who aren't familiar with the story , here's a brief recap : greaser bad boy danny and aussie good girl sandy are reunited for their 1959 senior year at rydell high after a brief fling during the summer ; both thought she was going to return to her native continent before school started , but both were wrong . 

sandy tries to rekindle their relationship , but danny's too cool a cat to fall for her wholesome appeal in front of his t-bird buddies ( including jeff conaway ) . 

so sandy hooks up with a gang herself -- the pink ladies , headed by sassy , sexy rizzo ( stockard channing , just superb as an independent woman well ahead of her time ) -- and danny , who still really feels love for her , attempts a compromise of ideals in order to win her back . 

the drag race finale is yet something of a drag , and i never have thought much of "" greased lightening , "" the film's big "" guy "" number ( that choreography -- ack ! ) , but "" grease "" 's flaws amount too few to carp . 

the movie's first showpiece is "" summer nights , "" where danny and sandy separately recount wildly different versions of their fun-in-the-sun romance . 

not only is "" nights "" tremendously catchy , but it's also a smart look at how men and women see the same events with varying eyes . 

there has yet to be a live-action musical sequence that rivals the one-two punch of "" you're the one that i want "" and "" we go together , "" "" grease "" 's euphoric cappers . 

all this and some of the most pleasing moments come from the smaller , quieter moments ; the oscar-nominated "" hopelessly devoted to you "" is a lovely showcase for newton-john , and channing's lamenting ballad "" there are worse things i could do "" is one of "" grease "" 's most unjustly overlooked tunes . 

the soundtrack is remastered ( though travolta still hits that awful high note at the end of "" nights "" ) and the restored widescreen allows us to see previously pan-and-scanned-out choreography , but nothing else has changed -- no computer-generated backgrounds , no outtakes or new musical numbers , no jabba the hutt cameos . 

and it's a testament to "" grease "" 's timeless success that nothing needs to be changed -- it's the same all-around blast it's always been , with an appealing cast in a fun story told with great music . 

to '90s viewers , "" grease "" will probably recall disco and bellbottoms as much as it made its original audience nostalgic for doo-wop and poodle skirts . 

but regardless of what decade it transports us to , we can all agree on one thing -- without a doubt , "" grease "" is still the word .

"those of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely to be surprised by the fact that i have not read victor hugo's novel les miserables . 

i don't know if a lot of people have , though i imagine many are familiar with the popular musical based on the novel . 

i haven't even seen that . 

going into this film , i had almost no knowledge of the story or its characters ( i even expected the film to be a musical ) . 

walking away from it , i'm kind of glad i had no prior experience with the material . 

writer/director bille august's film version is a straightforward , beautifully told film . 

liam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean ; in the beginning , he has just been released from a 19-year prison sentence . 

he is allowed to stay in a convent by a kindly priest despite his rude and destructive behavior . 

the priest's words of wisdom influence him , and he makes a vow to change himself . 

nine years later , we are informed that he is now the mayor of a town called vigo ; nobody knows his real name , and that he is wanted for skipping his parole nine years ago . 

conflicts arise when inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is assigned to vigo . 

valjean remembers javert as one of the prison guards who constantly beat him , and javert remembers jean to be a convict . 

javert is hell-bent on upholding the law , and he does everything in his power to bring jean to justice . 

along the way , valjean meets and falls in love with a peasant woman , fantine ( uma thurman ) , and vows to take care of her daughter , cosette ( played later by claire danes ) . 

les miserables is visually a solid and often striking picture . 

the production design by anna asp is authentic and vast , and the sets don't look like sets ( they look like real towns and villages ) ; gabriella pescucci's costumes are noticeably spectacular . 

basil poledouris' soundtrack is thick and usually well-placed ( though it does get a bit heavy at times ) . 

many scenes in the film have a memorable photographic quality , such as the climax , which takes place next to a dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening . 

augusts keeps the story simple ( which i hear is a good thing , since the novel is so complex ) and easy to follow . 

he manages to develop the main characters and most of the subplots adequately . 

i was also impressed that he didn't go overboard with flash and style , which is something so many directors seem to be doing to classic stories these days ( such as baz luhrmann's vicious tragedy william shakespeare's romeo + juliet ) . 

this film feels solid and whole , and each scene has a certain amount of importance and vigor that keeps the audience interested . 

liam neeson is terrific in the main role ; neeson is the kind of actor who does solemn desperation extremely well , and valjean is certainly a man who clearly fits that adjective . 

thurman , in her small role , is very good , and proves that she has a lot of range and can perform in a very non-glamorous role such as this one . 

rush is absolutely incredible as javert ; i don't remember ever feeling so strongly about a villain as i do here ; he adds depth and complexity with subtle glances and nuances , and effortlessly makes each of his scenes intense . 

i can't be as charitable for danes , however ; though i know she is a talented actress , here she tends to overact when it might have been better to underplay the character a bit . 

les miserables is , as i've said , a solid , intelligent motion picture . 

my only complaint is that it feels a bit too easy , and perhaps too staged . 

each scene is grand and huge , and exploding with poledouris' score , but i didn't always want them to be . 

for the most part , les miserables is not a subtle or deep picture . 

it's a good movie , and tells its story well , but august tends to hand-feed us themes and scenes that would have worked better had they been more subtle . 

however , in a film this exciting and well-produced , a few minor flaws are easily overlooked .

"she was the femme in "" la femme nikita . "" 

he was the baldwin in "" backdraft , "" "" sliver , "" and "" fair game "" ( with cindy crawford ) . 

together , anne parillaud and william baldwin conspire to make "" shattered image "" the biggest piece of hooey since the stallone/stone "" thriller "" "" the specialist . "" 

the film poses the question "" what if the life you're living now is really a dream , and your dreams reality ? "" 

it's either about a woman who's haunted by a recurring ( and recurring and recurring ) nightmare that she's a hired assassin , or it's about a hired assassin who's haunted by a recurring ( and recurring and recurring ) nightmare that she's honeymooning with william baldwin in jamaica . 

it doesn't much matter and believe me by the time "" shattered image "" runs its painful and pedestrian course you won't care . 

these two lives , with parillaud looking like siouxsie sioux with a black wig , black emotionless eyes , and black leather clothing in the seattle-based assassin scenes , and moping around like karen carpenter in the jamaica scenes , play out endlessly throughout the film and the result is it's now * twice * as boring as it might have been . 

it's not that complicated plots can't be entertaining . 

of course it helps if you have interesting characters , crisp dialogue , and a modicum of style . 

 "" shattered image "" isn't complex , it's just stupid . 

and boring . 

parillaud and baldwin , who aren't exactly shakespearean material to begin with , are saddled with such leaden dialogue that their characters have zero chance of breaking free of their cardboard confines . 

lines like : 

 "" you don't beg , you insist . 

i like that in a woman . "" 

that's parillaud's character talking . . . 

to her cat ! 

and : 

 "" you're not the reason i couldn't care less about you . "" 

huh ? 

and this wonderful bathroom interchange early in the film : 

 "" if you give me a couple of minutes you know i'll charm the pants off you . "" 

 "" i don't have that kind of time . "" 

talking of pants , parillaud has her clothes off faster than you can say "" point of no return . "" 

we have come to expect this from billy baldwin , but it might have been nice to have learned something about their characters first . 

but there's nothing to learn . 

karen is as interesting as a cereal box , a someone's-out-to-get-me crybaby who imagines the voice at the other end of the phone , the stranger who sends her flowers , maybe even her husband himself , is her would-be killer . 

siouxsie is the chromium cool , tough-as-nails crack killing machine who shoots out a couple of mirrors in order to justify the film's meaningless stock title . 

baldwin seems more interested in parillaud's nest egg ( so that he can pave paradise and put up a parking lot ) than he does in her . 

each time graham greene shows up he gets killed . 

barbet schroeder ( "" reversal of fortune "" ) co-produced and should be ashamed of himself . 

every now and again it's fun to watch a really bad movie . 

and every now and again , as "" shattered image "" makes agonizingly clear , it isn't . 
"
" "" meg ryan is irresistible in the comedy that celebrates sisterhood ! , "" 

screams the television ads for "" hanging up , "" disastrously written by real-life sisters delia and nora ephron and sloppily directed by diane keaton . 

make me laugh again ! 

not only is "" hanging up "" misadvertised , since the film wholeheartedly focuses on middle sister meg ryan and gives her two co-stars , lisa kudrow and diane keaton , little more than extended cameos , but they don't actually come together until the final ten to fifteen minutes . 

and we are supposed to believe their strong bond , and smile in the last scene when they rekindle their rocky relationship , despite them being apart for the majority of the running time ? 

excuse me , again , while i almost bust a gut at that truly delusional notion . 

eve marks ( meg ryan ) is the middle mozzell sister , still living in the california town where she grew up , and with a husband ( adam arkin ) and pre-teen son ( jesse james ) . 

her elderly , wisecracking father , lou ( walter matthau , in his brightest performance in years ) has just recently been put into the hospital , in the final stages of what i assume is alzheimer's ( even though the film never enlightens us on exactly what is wrong with him ) . 

while eve's relationship with her mother ( cloris leachman ) is nearly nonexistent , since she ran out on lou and her children years ago , she has had her fair share of up's and down's with lou , who used to be an alcoholic . 

her older sister is georgia ( diane keaton ) , an editor for the self-titled magazine , "" georgia , "" while maddy ( lisa kudrow ) is the youngest , a soap opera actress . 

interestingly , their professions are given , but we not once ever see them working at their jobs , or , for that matter , learn much of anything about them . 

maddy , georgia , and eve do not see each other much anymore , their adult lives gradually causing them to drift apart , but they do manage to consistently talk on the phone to one another . 

and they talk . 

and talk . 

and talk . . . 

in fact , the telephone is the major star of the film , even more so than ryan , as it appears in virtually every scene of this interminable 92-minute catastrophe that feels like its three hours long . 

if you are able to get through the opening half-hour , in which phones ring so much you feel like jumping through the screen and taking a sledgehammer to them , you will surely survive the rest . 

the question is , who would want to subject themselves to this resolutely irritating , self-involved pat-on-the-back ? 

how could a comedy-drama that has the star-power of meg ryan , lisa kudrow , and diane keaton be so very bad in so many different ways ? 

issues from the past involving the possible jealousy each has had for one of the others is fleetingly brought up , but the film isn't mature enough to deal with such a thing in a thoughtful manner , and since we learn next to nothing about their childhood , it is a lost cause that comes off as nothing more than an afterthought . 

also , it is expected that the viewer quickly catch on to the tricky dynamic that the three sisters have with one another , but no dynamic metamorphosizes . 

and when they do reunite in the finale , their whole consanguinity is reduced to a repulsively annoying three-minute scene in which they argue like little children . 

you can see the impending death coming a mile away , and it conveniently occurs in the next scene , so that the three can quickly come to terms with themselves , and with each other . 

you think to yourself : "" the only thing left for them to do is have a playful food-fight , "" and like clockwork , it also occurs by the end credits . 

meg ryan is a versatile actress ( look no further than 1998's "" hurlyburly "" or 1994's "" when a man loves a woman "" ) , despite her various detractors who stubbornly believe all she can do is romantic comedies . 

with "" hanging up , "" the only thing she needs to do is completely sever her filmmaking ties with nora ephron , a writer/director/hack who shouldn't be allowed to work in hollywood again after this big-budget , high-profile debacle . 

even if she knew what she was making was not exactly up to par in the quality department , she nonetheless is very good , and the two scenes that work , flashbacks to christmas 1988 , when she had a heartbreaking run-in with her mother , and to halloween 1993 , when lou crashed her son's birthday party in a drunken stupor , are effective because of the realism ryan brings to the situations . 

diane keaton , as georgia , is better as an actress than a director here , but that is a wildly feeble compliment . 

what is more than a little far-fetched is that keaton is distinctly older than ryan and kudrow , although in the very brief glimpses we get at them as children , she is no more than five years ryan's senior . 

yeah , right . 

lastly , poor lisa kudrow has been wasted once again in a big-screen venture , after her even more thin role in 1999's "" analyze this . "" 

kudrow isn't given enough time to create a full personality with maddy , so it isn't her fault she doesn't register until a few quiet moments sprinkled throughout where she is actually blessed with being given dialogue . 

if anything , though , kudrow is a real talent , and i anxiously await the next time she is given a role more deserving of her time , as in her brilliantly nuanced , oscar-caliber work in 1998's "" the opposite of sex . "" 

if you are a fan of kudrow's ( and who isn't ? ) , do yourself a favor and rent this gem that puts more good use to kudrow in sixty seconds than "" hanging up "" does in its entirety . 

as eve's hardworking husband , adam arkin is , predictably , squandered with a role that gives him next to nothing to do , until a subplot reveals itself midway through , only to never be mentioned again . 

cloris leachman , as with ryan and matthau , makes a small , but noticeable impression with her , albeit , very brief appearance , while edie mcclurg , as a rosy-cheeked woman lou had an affair with in the christmas 1988 flashback , manages one of the few laughs in this otherwise joyless production . 

nearly all the emotions displayed within "" hanging up "" are patently manufactured , and despite the movie wanting the viewer to care about the characters , aside from eve , why would you want to when they are all spoiled brats ? 

if , for some bizarre , "" twilight zone "" -type of reason , you find yourself in a movie theater showing this film , my suggestion would be to hang up on it before the opening credits are over . 

saying it is a waste of time is an understatement of epic proportions . 
"
"it's actually not so bad that dreamworks decided to release the love letter at about the same time as star wars episode i : the phantom menace , because this way less people will have to sit through this dreadful little comedy . 

and no , i really don't feel guilty about wishing this movie death at the box-office . 

really , i don't . 

not at all . 

the plot has been done before -- a mysterious , unaddressed love letter shows up in a small town , causing confusion for everyone who reads it . 

the center of the ensuing disaster is bookstore owner helen ( kate capshaw , and by the way , what is it with bookstore owner main characters ? 

in the past year and a half we've seen them in life is beautiful , you've got mail , this movie , and the upcoming notting hill ) , who finds the letter in between couch cushions in the bookstore . 

she immediately starts testing other people to see who it might be from , and comes to the ( incorrect ) conclusion that the author of the note is a young employee played by tom everett scott . 

he , reading the letter himself , assumes that she wrote it for him . 

after a while , they fall in love ( well , duh ) . 

kate feels guilty about getting in a relationship with someone more than twenty years younger than her , and she also feels guilty because at the same time she is also involved with the town fireman ( tom selleck ) . 

to add to her turmoil , her mother shows up ( blythe danner , who apparently must have had her daughter when she was about 9 ) and her trusted bookstore manager ( deadpan ellen degeneres ) quits . 

supporting characters aren't called supporting for nothing . 

their purpose isn't just to move the plot along , they're also supposed to give the storyline a backbone . 

to do this , they must exhibit at least marginal depth and must also be interesting . 

rarely can a movie work if it puts an interesting protagonist in the middle and surrounds her with hackneyed , dull , cardboard secondary characters , especially when at the core of the movie is the protagonist's various interactions with them . 

this is the love letter's damning error . 

capshaw's character is as good as i have seen present in recent romantic comedies , but the people that surround her are all either underwritten or purely one-dimensional . 

because of that , the love letter is awkward and insincere . 

even worse -- it's a bore . 

i liked capshaw and her helen , but everyone else is painfully fake , undermining the little drama or sexual tension that has the potential to exist . 

there is nothing particularly hilarious about all this either -- and besides degeneres' wisecracks , there's little that is even a little amusing . 

this is not a completely thoughtless film and director peter ho-sun chan does a good job of portraying helen's yearnings and various subtle complexities . 

but it's far from profound . 

there isn't a common theme running through the proceedings , thus the movie seems thoughtfully pointless . 

really , this is a harmless little movie ; it's far from an abomination and it's not torturous to sit through . 

but bad , it is . 

awful , it also is . 

the love letter is a failure , and an inane failure at that .

"i think of i know what you did last summer as the movie that scream and scream 2 could have been . 

mind you , though , i mean this in the worst possible way . 

i know what you did last summer is a typical slasher flic without the smarts of the scream's . 

as a result , it's even worse than some of your better campy horror pictures ( see nightmare on elm street ) because it thinks it's about thirty times smarter than it is . 

based on a teen book of the same name and , disappointingly , adapted by scream scribe kevin williamson , i know what you did last summer begins with appropriately angsty modern rock music combined with some startling cinematography of a cliff along the ocean and an angsty sort sitting at the top . 

the appropriate mood being set ( this is angst-horror for the 90's ) , we cut over to the july 4th parade in a small north carolina town . 

from there , we see the blond , female protagonist , helen shivers ( woodenly played by sarah michelle geller ) , getting crowned croaker queen as the blond male "" hero , "" barry cox ( woodenly played by ryan phillipe ) , and matched brunette pair of protagonists , julie james and ray bronson ( woodenly played by party of five's jennifer love hewitt and freddie prinze jr . , respectively ) cheer her on . 

after getting drunk at a party , going to a beach to wittily discuss urban legend and indulge in some foreshadowing , and having some meaningful sex ( if you believe what the characters say ) , the four run down some guy crossing the windy cliff road at night . 

his face is mangled so they can't tell who it is , and they come to the decision to dump him in the ocean so as to not ruin any of their future chances for success in the world . 

cut to one year later . 

the lives of our protagonists have gone from annoying to bad . 

main brunette female , the bright one of the bunch , has been plagued with guilt and almost failed out of college . 

blond female has forfeited her dreams of starring on guiding light , and now works at the family store in town . 

brunette male is a fisherman , living off the land . 

blond male has become a complete jerk and quarterback on some college football team . 

then , predictably , their past comes back to haunt them . 

it all begins with an irrational murder , followed by some taunting of protagonists by the mysterious killer , bad acting by a good actress ( anne heche ) , an improbable plot , bad acting by the main bad actors , some more killing , concluding in a climactic scene , mostly climactic in the relief at the end of the movie . 

all the while , the actors and actresses spout off bad lines , and main brunette male does his best keanu reeves imitation . 

not that the movie was without pleasure . 

count the illogical plot twists and bad lines for some fun . 

mostly , though , note the costumes of main females and how trendily unattractive they make the otherwise eye-catching pair look .

"pollock starring ed harris , marcia gay harden , tom bower , jennifer connelly screenplay by barbara turner and susan j . emshwiller , based on the book "" jackson pollock : an american saga "" by steven naifeh and gregory white smith directed by ed harris

 "" how do you know when you're finished making love ? "" 

-jackson pollock to a life magazine reporter on recognizing when you've completed a painting 

jackson pollock's "" making love "" quote is famous , but in practically the same breath , he said a more constructive thing , "" it's like looking at a bed of flowers--tear your hair out over what it means . "" 

it took him sixteen words to do as whole dissertations have tried and failed : equate god and abstract art and offer a kind of backhanded comfort to those confused to the point of resentment by the concept . 

the biopic _pollock_ , actor ed harris' directorial debut , reflects the second soundbite in how it accepts pollock's creations as part of the order of things , and should similarly disarm haters of fine art . 

arguably more than any other living actor , harris , who also plays _pollock_ , embodies the archetypal working stiff , and his blue-collar demystification of pollock's labour-intensive art , both as performer and director , makes for unpretentious cinema . 

 ( from what i know of harris , he , like pollock , was not born gifted or lucky ; instead , a strong work ethic is the seed of his success . ) 

granted , it's possible that _pollock_ will alienate those same viewers perplexed by the imponderable "" purpose "" of pollock's splatter series : the common thread between them is a lack of editorializing . 

the movie _pollock_ is all purposeful gazes and silent exchanges dotted by tantrums , but the motivations are left to our own perceptions . 

and it is a sympathetic yet not altogether forgiving film , as illustrated by a disheartening conclusion . 

_pollock_ encapsulates the period in which he fought a losing battle against personal demons ( alcoholism , depression , and the general attendant miseries of an artist ) while finding a place of subconscious expression . 

a brief introduction to pollock's raging drunk side segues into his getting accosted by a fellow new york artist , lee krasner ( marcia gay harden , awarded a best supporting actress oscar for this brilliant portrayal ) , who works from the outside-in , pre-intellectualizing every stroke of her brush . 

in a scene after they have moved in together and established adjoining studios , she asks what he hopes to achieve on his latest canvas , grilling him about the interplay of cubism and surrealism until he says , "" you paint the fucking thing , "" and leaves in a huff . 

by the time they wed , she has become his de facto manager ; it is form marrying function and chaos marrying discipline , a most harmonious collision . 

 ( krasner denies him a baby , indicating that it would upset the balance . ) 

such a union is destined to implode , and i hope i'm not ruining the _pollock_ experience by saying that it does . 

while it is never depicted as a very romantic matrimony to start--pollock and wife channel their passions elsewhere--their symbiosis leaves each other picked dry after several years , and it comes down to krasner suffering one of pollock's conniptions too many : "" you are killing me ! 

you are killing me ! 

you are killing me ! "" 

 ( aside : harris' own wife , amy madigan , is unrecognizable and exceptional as gallery diva peggy guggenheim . ) 

pollock himself moves on to dalliances with younger women like ruth klingman ( the scorching jennifer connelly ) , hoping , one supposes , to catch the revitalizing whiff of youth . 

i love jackson pollock's stuff and i am enamoured of harris' _pollock_ as well . 

it's scrappy and observant ; no coincidence that its minor failings are the occasional invasive flourish , such as jeff beal's hummable but no less lamentable score--i can't imagine that pollock , or anyone , would paint to this music , which puts filling soundtrack voids ahead of complementing the images . 

one of my favourite sequences is an eerily quiet re-enactment of hans namuth shooting that famous pollock footage in east hampton , long island ; the mounting tension is almost comic , as namuth keeps interrupting pollock's process to reload his camera or take a dinner break . 

a more seasoned director might've been too arrogant to admit that not all artists or mediums are created equal . 
"
"at first glance , i thought that the sword and the sorceror had promise . 

its plotline goes like this : the evil king cromwell , desiring to take over the world , resurrects an evil , ancient sorceror , xusia for power . 

he attacks the kingdom of eh-dan and kills young prince talon's parents . 

given a triple-bladed sword ( which can shoot bad guys , like a gun ) by his dying father , talon vows for revenge . 

eleven years later , when he's established his own army , the mercaneries , he vows to take back his kingdom . 

along the way , he meets up with alana , whose village is attacked by drunken guards and her brother is kidnapped by cromwell . 

talon vows to help , and , after a series of minor escapades , eventually ends up rescuing alana's brother ( and several other prisoners ) , only to be captured himself ( in other words , put on a cross to be crucified ! ) . 

fortunately he frees himself , rescues alana from marrying cromwell , defeats xusia , and then cromwell , all with his triple bladed sword ( during the final battle , the blade breaks , but talon finishes cromwell off by using a hidden dagger in the blade ) . 

then , everything ends happily . 

unfortunately , the sword and the sorcerer is not even half as good as it sounds . 

what would have been a great film is completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping , bad acting , and gruesomely gory , bloody scenes . 

never once does the story seem to connect together , it just jumps around repeatedly . 

this problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia . 

after telling him that he needs his help , he leads the warlock out into daylight , but then stabs him and sends him careening off a cliff afterwards . 

wait a minute , didn't the plotline say that he needs the help of xusia in order to invade eh-dan , which he cannot do by military force ? 

if that is the case , why does he dispose of xusia after resurrecting him ? 

and why does he manage to take over eh-dan anyway ? 

these questions are just never - no , never - answered in the film . 

another example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life , another moment we see him just about to be crucified during alana's wedding to cromwell ( ! ) , and finally at the end , instead of settling down with alana , he just tells her to "" wait "" , and then he just rides off ! 

in addition to the extremely bloody scenes , this uneven plot jumping completely destroys what would have been a great fantasy adventure . 

even some attempts to make it exciting , a few fire scenes , battle scenes , don't work . 

it just completely fails altogether miserably . 

the only good thing about this film is its musical score , contributed by david whittaker , who had an ( extremely ) short music composing career . 

the score is boomy and adventurous , powerful , and a billion times better than this film is . 

my suggestion : steer the hell away from this bloody mess and buy the soundtrack album instead ( if you can find it ) . 

ironically , though , before the film's credits roll , there is a message indicating that a sequel , tales of the ancient empire , would follow . 

to my relief ( and delight ) , it never got into production , because the sword and the sorcerer laid an egg at the box office , grossing only $39 million . 

critics were right on in slamming the sword and the sorcerer , all right . 

leonard maltin rightfully called it "" second rate in scripting , and acting "" and at-a-glance film reviews called it "" a confusing , stupid , unimaginative , unengaging , bloodfilled bore "" . 

i totally agree with these reviews , all right , and i hope that this piece of #$% ! 

will be forgotten about . 

there are far better fantasy movies than the sword and the sorcerer . 

i hope you get a good laugh out of this review , but i am not laughing . 

in fact , my insults don't even come close to the gruesome sickness that this film gave me throughout its 100 minute running time .

"seen may 2 , 1998 at 3 : 40 p . m . at the crossgates cinema 18 , theater #13 , with chris wessell and sean o'shea for $5 . 

[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture , and seats] 

the big-budget , mega-hype "" event "" movie is becoming so trendy now it is becoming a weekly routine instead of a seasonal one . 

gluttony is hollywood's favorite sin , but it is the movie-goers who pay the price by being dealt the same things over and over on an ever-worsening basis . 

 "" lost in space "" is the latest such offering - a film so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre . 

it's made up of every element of science fiction , but at no time does it evoke the slightest amount of wonderment the genre was meant for . 

audiences' attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is the trend with such films , this one opens with a fast-paced space battle which serves not only as the most interesting scene in the film ( probably because it has "" star wars "" written all over it ) , but as the producers' way of showing off their budget through the special effects . 

battle scenes are worthless without tension , and since we have no idea what the setting is it's impossible to care about anything that happens . 

in essence , the entire segment works like a teaser for an arcade game , not a piece of filmmaking . 

we meet the robinson family - a family of five that does not get along but has been chosen to act on earth's behalf in effort to find another planet worthy of colonization due to the exhausting of our natural resources . 

each member of the family has a special trait and personality , and yet none of them seem like actual people . 

professor john robinson ( hurt ) is the intelligent , quiet leader who has devoted so much time to his work his family and marriage are suffering without his realizing it ( it's obvious what role this aspect will play ) . 

of course this is all established through extremely melodramatic scenes such as the children and parents arguing and bickering among themselves and with each other , while the necessary problems are "" resolved "" at the right moments . 

the only thing worse than the screenplay is the fact it's presented in a completely serious manner without a trace of satire , and is so pathetic it's laughable . 

the first act is not a building of a story , but a juxtaposition of scenes that serve no purpose other than to plug in all the required elements ( such as plot , conflict , and characterization - god forbid ! ) . 

we're provided with the minimum amount possible of these elements to keep the film from being completely silent . 

in fact , it might as well be since the dialogue is virtually non-existent . 

yes , the characters do speak , but they do not talk . 

they say things that only relate to the conflict , but they never really interact ( unless it's the cartoony flirting scenes between arrogant major don west ( leblanc ) and uptight , unemotional judy robinson ( graham ) ) . 

it's amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue and generic plot devices that so little happens . 

eventually the pacing rapidly increases , but the amount of genuine interest does not . 

the story finally gains some prospective by living up to its title as the robinsons find themselves lost in space after narrowly managing to defeat dr . smith ( oldman ) , the cartoony villain , and his plans for sabotage . 

what ensues is a series upon series of completely unrelated conflicts . 

the first such scene takes place on an abandoned spaceship and what ensues could best be described as "" alien "" -lite . 

the story changes again when the robinsons crash land on an alien planet and must act quickly to escape it and survive . 

but there's never any real notion of suspense here because the script constantly wanders aimlessly . 

plotlines are developed , but each becomes totally irrelevant as the story changes from scenario to scenario . 

the atmosphere attempts to be surreal by incorporating time travel and various time paradoxes , but it's presented in such a ridiculous way it's utterly boring . 

by the time the last act rolls around , there is no sense of a payoff building . 

the ending does not go out on a high note with any kind of climax , instead , it seems to come to a sudden halt ( but at least it ends at all ) . 

 "" lost in space "" is major film production at its worst . 

it's frightening that a film so poorly written , directed , and acted might be considered mainstream entertainment .

"one of my brother's favorite movies is h . b . halicki's 1974 cult flick "" gone is sixty seconds , "" one of the best products of the car-chase genre that provided drive-in fare during the 1970's . 

chase pics had more tire squeals than dialogue , but they had a strong visceral appeal . 

although it boasts a bigger budget and familiar stars , the remake of "" gone in sixty seconds "" is relatively weak and dull . 

randall "" memphis "" raines ( nicolas cage ) is a retired car thief who runs a go-cart track . 

he got out of crime so that his younger brother kip ( giovanni ribisi ) would not take up boosting cars . 

however , kip became a thief anyway , and now he's in big trouble . 

kip promised to deliver fifty luxury and sports cars to gangster raymond calitri ( christopher eccleston ) by the end of the week . 

calitri expects memphis to fulfill kip's bargain ; if he doesn't come through , kip dies . 

memphis gathers his old crew ( angelina jolie , robert duvall , will patton , chi mcbride , and vinnie jones ) , and kip brings his boys ( t . j . 

cross , william lee scott , scott caan , and james duval ) . 

as if calitri breathing down their necks wasn't bad enough , the team is pursued by a cop ( delroy lindo ) who's still ticked off that he never busted memphis and by a rival gangster ( rap star master p ) who wants to take over calitri's clients . 

watching "" gone , "" i discovered that stealing fifty cars is not any more interesting than stealing one . 

maybe that's why the first forty-nine are fairly easy , and the thrills are saved for "" eleanor , "" a 1967 shelby gto , a model that has always eluded memphis . 

but the big chase doesn't live up to the long wait . 

i had high hopes for "" gone "" because it is director dominic sena's second film . 

 "" kalifornia , "" his 1993 debut , was a brilliant study in the relationship between violence and its audience . 

in that movie sena took a simple thriller plot ( a couple gives a serial killer a ride ) and successfully endowed it with deeper significance . 

in "" gone "" he seems to be aiming for a drama about two brothers who can't communicate with each other , but that goal just doesn't mesh with this plot . 

 "" gone "" either takes itself too seriously or not seriously enough . 

it's not light enough to be fun , or mean enough to be intense . 

this chaser has more dialogue than tire squeals but is none the better for it . 

the lack of action is a waste of the premise , which should have challenged the filmmakers to create the most spectacular car chases ever . 

the weak script is a waste of a talented cast . 

in a "" newsweek "" interview last year , sean penn blasted his old pal nic cage for making bad movies . 

much as i like cage , for every good picture he does ( "" leaving las vegas , "" "" bringing out the dead "" ) , there are two major stinkers ( "" snake eyes , "" "" con air , "" "" 8mm , "" "" city of angels "" ) . 

that ratio is probably better than what a lot of his peers can boast , but cage has real talent . 

it's a shame to waste it in glitzy , superficial tripe like "" gone in 60 seconds . "" 
"
" "" the red violin "" is a cold , sterile feature that leaves you uninvolved and detached . 

it's a movie that seems almost clinical , as it traces the 300-plus-years history of the legendary musical instrument of the title . 

opening in the 17th century , the story shows how violin-maker nicolo bussotti created the instrument as a gift for his unborn son . 

but when tragedy strikes , the violin becomes the personification of its maker's grief . 

from there the violin comes into the hands of an orphaned child prodigy at an austrian monastery . 

again , tragedy strikes as the child is struck down at the moment of his triumph . 

we follow the violin through the centuries as it finds a home in england and in mao's communist china before being discovered by expert charles morritz ( samuel l . jackson ) , who mounts a painstaking investigation to prove its authenticity . 

the violin becomes morritz's obsession , just as it is for all those who converge on a montreal auction house to bid on it . 

morritz , however , is the only one who knows the secret of the instrument and can understand and appreciate its creator's intention . 

 "" the red violin "" could have been a touching , inspirational story , as soaring as a beethoven symphony . 

however director francois girard fails to make any emotional connection with the viewer . 

here is a story that could have made use of various camera angles and lighting to heighten its impact . 

girard , for some unknown reason , uses mostly master shots , keeping his camera - and thus us - at a distance . 

we get no feel for the miracle that is the violin . 

it's resonance , its purity of sound are not emphasized enough to make an impression . 

nor are any of the performances memorable . 

it's as if girard wanted all his actors to play second fiddle to his violin . 

 "" the red violin "" promises much , but delivers little . 

it is dull at times , a bit pretentious and a might murky . 

the movie's music soars over its story and performers . 

and that is its only saving grace .

"no film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordan's harrowing , humorous , horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabe's novel about young lad francie brady's ( eamonn owens ) descent into madness in 1960s ireland . 

on one hand , it was difficult for me to become invested in francie's story because he is such an unsavory character , unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs . nugent ( fiona shaw ) . 

on another hand , i found it difficult to laugh at some of francie's darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick , needy child , having been raised by a drunken father ( stephen rea ) and a suicidal mother ( aisling o'sullivan ) . 

on yet another hand , i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his , for lack of a better word , "" bad "" deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he performs them . 

however , the butcher boy's power is undeniable , and the film as a whole is unforgettable--perhaps because it is so disturbing . 

what makes it so unsettling is the francie's overall wink-wink yet matter-of-fact attitude about everything , expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie ( rea again ) . 

think heavenly creatures played largely for laughs , and you'll sort of understand . 

anchoring the whole film is the astonishing debut performance of owens ; love francie or hate him , you cannot take your eyes off of owens . 

the butcher boy truly is a twisted , unusual film that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable . 

in the lobby after the screening , i overheard one man raving about how great yet disturbing it was ; i also heard one particularly offended woman say with disgust , "" that movie was so unfunny ! "" 

 "" i didn't know what to expect . 

it's like something you chase for so long , but then you don't know how to react when you get it . 

i still don't know how to react . ""

"50's `aliens vs . 

earth' idea revamped ! 

if you have been following the movie news over the net , you could not have escaped the hype over id4 . 

it promises to be the summer film of the year and it has all the elements necessary . 

id4 opened in the us on 2nd of july , and up till now , only after a week of release , it has nearly touched the us$100 million mark , a phenomenon last observed when jurassic park was released back in 1993 . 

the premise of the movie is disgustingly simple : earth defends itself against the aliens , a typical and highly popular 50's hollywood theme which manifested itself in many films produced in that era . 

the movie opens via star wars , however unoriginal it may be , it worked . 

the aliens have sent a large mother ship ( supposedly to be 1/4 size of the moon ) to attack earth by deploying attack ships 15 miles in radius to all the major cities on earth . 

the us president ( pullman ) does not know of the aliens' intention but soon finds out when david ( goldblum ) a scientist , discovers that the aliens are counting down to a synchronised attack on all the major cities . 

capt . hiller ( smith ) , a hot-shot f-18 pilot are one of the hundreds assigned to take out the hovering alien attack ship over washington dc . 

his squadron came under heavy alien fire after discovering that their weapons were useless against the invaders , he crash lands after a spectacular 1-on-1 chase over the grand canyon , one of the many highlights of the movie . 

id4 features many characters and we are shown the impact on them as the story progresses . 

acting on the whole was ok although i thought that bill pullman was a bit unsuitable for the president role but he did make a very rousing speech before sending his troops into battle ( do we smell a bit of braveheart here ? ? ) . 

no prizes for guessing how id4 ends , its just plain obvious . 

id4 borrows heavily from star wars , return of the jedi , alien and in some parts of the movie , i could even sense a bit of x-files on screen . 

if i were to critically review this movie , id4 is full of plot holes , corny dialogue , and ridiculously dumb aliens . 

however below that wafer-thin plot and on-screen flaws , id4 scored well in playing with the appealing idea of the entire world giving up their petty differences to unite themselves as one force against the alien invasion . 

an idea which will have the audience strongly rooting for the united front throughout the movie , thus maintaining a screen-viewer interaction that virtually render any holes in the movie acceptable , no matter how ridiculous . 

id4 was produced under a modest budget of us$68 million , a film of such magnitude would have easily been another waterworld but director roland emmerich ( universal soldier , stargate ) and producer dean devlin assembled a team which did their own special effects rather than commissioning it to ilm or any other special effects company . 

some of the effects are not too good but most of it are very believable , especially the epic standoff between 150 f-18's and 250 alien saucers , reminiscence of the classic space battle featured in return of the jedi . 

id4 is a movie for all . 

though there are many explosions and implied deaths , there are no gory scenes of human destruction , thus young kids should be able to take it . 

sit back and don't be too critical , chances are you will be absorbed into the movie just as i was . 

if you are not planning to watch any movies this year , please , at least make time for this one . 

this film is best watched on the big-screen .

" "" what's your favorite new york moment ? "" 

 "" this one's climbing the charts . "" 

starring john cusack , kate beckinsale , eugene levy , molly shannon . 

directed by peter chelsom . 

rated pg-13 . 

there's no doubt that 95% of romantic comedies follow a distinct pattern : guy sees girl , guy wants girl , guy goes through unreasonable obstacles to get girl , guy gets girl . 

in rare cases , the genders are flipped . 

predictability is a given . 

rarely , though , is a romantic comedy as cheap , as obvious , or as pointless as serendipity , a film that uses its "" theme "" as an excuse for its plot contrivances . 

 "" lightweight "" doesn't begin to describe it . 

this is like anti-gravity . 

it begins in a new york city bloomingdale's , a product placement that rivals cast away's fedex for sheer blatancy . 

jonathan trager ( john cusack ) and sara thomas ( kate beckinsale ) both go for the same pair of gloves . 

after going through the perfunctory motions , jonathan gets to keep the gloves and the two of them go out for ice cream , followed by ice skating . 

jonathan falls hard , and sara is charmed . 

when she writes her name and number down on a piece of paper , a truck rumbles by and blows it out of her hand . 

she takes this as a sign from fate that they shouldn't be together ; jonathan is flabbergasted . 

to pacify him , she comes up with an idea : jonathan will write his number on a 5 dollar bill , which she will promptly spend . 

when she gets home , she will write her name and number inside a book ( "" love in the time of cholera "" ) and sell it to a used bookstore . 

if the bill gets back to her or the book to him , it will mean that they are meant to be together . 

three years later . 

both sara and jonathan are now engaged to other love interests . 

both realize they aren't content . 

both go looking for the other . 

what happens now is so absurd that i'm almost tempted to recommend the film for the sake of seeing it . 

the two of them run circles around each other in a set of incredible "" coincidences "" that i would describe as contrivances if it weren't for the film oh-so-cleverly dismissing that criticism by building its plot around "" serendipity . "" 

of course , since the movie is about fate , the screenwriter can do anything he damn well pleases . 

i'm not buying it . 

there's no suspense in any of this because we know exactly what's going to happen , but serendipity insists on drilling its purportedly "" adorable "" non-story into our heads . 

instead of "" will they meet ? "" 

the question we're asking is "" when will they meet already ? "" 

to make matters worse , every "" coincidence "" is telegraphed from a mile away ; by the last reel i was bored enough to actively look for signs that something else "" incredible "" was going to happen . 

cusack is fine and beckinsale , at least , isn't saddled with another lumbering , clunky screenplay ( she's had bad luck , what with brokedown palace and pearl harbor on her resume ) , just an inanely pointless one . 

serendipity also relieves the tedium with the amazing eugene levy , who plays a snarky bloomingdale's salesman . 

what's the interest in watching a movie that spirals around and around a predestined ( no pun intended ) conclusion ? 

serendipity wants to tug at the heartstrings , but it only tests our patience .

"ever wonder what happened to gabe kaplan ? 

you remember , he was the title character in that 70's sitcom , "" welcome back kotter . "" 

always trying to help out the sweathogs , frequently trying to dodge mr . woodman , ever wary of his wife's tuna casserole . 

 "" so , "" you ask , "" where is he now ? "" 

mr . kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional high-stakes poker . 

that's right . 

i'm not sure if it's his main source of income , but from what i've heard , the guy occasionally comes away with $20 , 000 at a time . 

and there you were , thinking i was going to tell you he was doing off-broadway theater . 

you silly goose . 

well , gabe kaplan isn't in the movie rounders , nor is the film about the actor come gambler's life . 

but rounders is about poker , and gabe plays poker , and i thought that was kind of a neat connection . 

sorry about the segue , or lack thereof . 

matt damon plays mike mcdermott , a law student who also has a singular talent for the game of poker . 

he's been playing for a while , and more than being proficient , he has caught the bug . 

he goes to all the underground games in new york city , knows the regulars , and knows how to win . 

in the beginning of the film , he's built up a nice thirty grand nest egg , which he takes to the speakeasy-type gaming parlor where the big boys play . 

mike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb ( john malkovich ) , an oreo-munching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia . 

mike has the potential to take a large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker , but instead he loses it all in a single hand . 

months later , he's paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck . 

when mike's best friend and poker buddy worm ( edward norton ) finishes his jail term for hustling some students , he wants to pick up right were they left off , working as a team to part others with their betting cash . 

although mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student , jo ( gretchen mol ) , worm connives mike into playing once more , and mike , bitten again by the bug , slides down that slippery slope , risking his relationship , education , and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life . 

to make a film about gambling , a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters . 

this is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with a stogie in his mouth . 

rounders , however , seems to go more for the latter than the former . 

the card clubs mike and worm frequent aren't very glamorous at all . 

there's a basement , a lodge with elk heads on the wall , a goulash joint - these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots . 

except for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city , the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table . 

the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it . 

we're given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations , and good actors to play them . 

matt damon is very natural as mike , who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school , and answering what may be his true calling , playing professional poker . 

ed norton's worm is truly a worm , always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they're worth . 

john turturro , who amazes me with his acting range , tones it down in this film by playing joey knish , a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments . 

he's both a friend and mentor to mike , and turturro's low-key performance is totally convincing , just as john malkovich's heavily-accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself . 

martin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike's law professors , abe petrovsky . 

while landau slips well into the role , his character , spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one's self , facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending . 

perhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line-up of acting talent , however , is gretchen mol who just didn't seem to have much presence on screen . 

she's a genuine peach to look at , kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel ( and i wouldn't be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond-haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world ) , but her delivered lines seemed very flat , and i found myself looking for matt damon's reactions instead . 

a good thing about rounders is that it doesn't get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can't find time for humor . 

the film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going , such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next , in widely different locales . 

one game in a cigar club had me in stitches . 

 "" i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper , "" says one of the players , clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other . 

i was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys . 

with all the poker being played , rounders had the potential to be very confusing . 

you might think you know a lot about poker , but think again . 

luckily , we're given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what's going on . 

the narrations are more informative than intrusive , and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do . 

it's nice that as the characters develop , so does our comprehension of their world . 

as a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker , rounders delivers in spades . 

wait ! 

as a film about the culture of cards , rounders is an ace . 

hang on ! 

packed with great acting and great characters , rounders is a full house . 

okay , i guess that's enough . 

oh , by the way , if you ever want to get into a game with ol' gabe kaplan , be sure to bring a note from epstein's mother .

"plot : a dude and his brother are driving cross-country and decide to fool around with a trucker on their cb radio .

lotsa nuttiness ensues and then , they pick up their other friend , venna , a girl who the dude has a crush on . 

but what's this . . . ? 

the trucker is still on their tail and is now harassing all three of the young whippersnappers . . . ? 

you bet ! 

buckle up , dorothy . . . this is gonna be one bumpy ride ! 

critique : a good ol' time at the movies ! 

here's a film that actually gives away most of its plotline in its trailer and doesn't really bring anything "" new "" to the forefront ( if you've seen flicks like duel and breakdown , you've crossed this path before ) , but still manages to entertain you gangbusters , with realistic situations , believable characters , funny moments , thrills , chills , the whole shebang . 

let's give it up for director john dahl , who continues to put out solid films every other year ( if you haven't seen red rock west , do yourself a favor right now , and jot it down on a piece of paper and rent it at your earliest convenience ) . 

and much like that film , this one has an excellent premise and sets everything up at an even pace . 

it gives you a little bit of background on each of the main three characters , and then shows you how one small prank , can lead to a whole lotta trouble for everyone ! 

paul walker really surprised me in this movie , since i've never much thought of him as anything more than a pretty face ( and damn , is it ever pretty or what ? ! ) 

but here , he actually manages to put some depth behind the looks and that's always appreciated in films in which you are so closely tied to the main characters . 

sobieski is also good , but she isn't in the movie for as long as you'd think , but the man who really takes this film to another level , is steve zahn . 

if you've loved this guy as the "" goofball "" in most of his previous roles , you'll appreciate him even more here , as the dude who starts off as one of the most manic and excited human beings i've seen in quite some time ( "" this is so awesome ! ! "" ) , 

only to turn into a man scared out of his wits by the end of the flick . 

and speaking of the ending , boy , does this movie deliver some chilling moments during its final 15 clicks or what ? ! ? 

the arrow and i were practically in each others arms ( well , maybe i'm exaggerating , but you catch my drift ) as each minute brought about another turn of events which in turn , took it all to an even higher level . 

once again , kudos to director dahl for being able to generate that type of intensity , suspense and tension , with a great score , editing , style and camerawork . 

plot-wise , i too did wonder how the "" bad guy "" was able to track them so well , but it didn't really bother me all that much ( you can assume that he had bugged their car ? ) . 

but pretty much everything else in the story stuck like glue and i couldn't help but put myself in their shoes and appreciate their thoroughly desperate circumstance . 

a great movie with an even cooler ending , this film will likely be remembered as one of the better thrillers of the year .

"
"i'm guessing -- and from the available evidence , it's not a great guess -- that burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire of hollywood excess , stupidity , ego and power-mongering . 

if so , the film that ended up on the screen ranks as one of the most spectacularly ironic unintentional jokes in film history . 

it has already been well-documented that the original title , an alan smithee film , became a problem when miserable test screenings forced re-cuts against the will of director arthur hiller , prompting hiller himself to opt for the directors' guild-mandated pseudonym of alan smithee . 

that left a film satire in the hands of writer joe eszterhas , as humorless a hack as ever put finger to word processor . 

and you could just smell the disaster brewing . 

if you're unfortunate enough to sit through burn hollywood burn , you'll still be smelling that disaster long after the lights come up . 

ostensibly , it's a pseudo-documentary account of a director named alan smithee ( eric idle ) who loses control of a big-budget action film called trio starring sylvester stallone , whoopi goldberg and jackie chan ( all of whom appear as themselves ) . 

when the only recourse available to him is abandoning the project to be called "" an alan smithee film "" -- which , of course , it already is -- smithee steals the negative of the film and threatens to destroy it . 

among the parties interviewed are the film's producer james edmunds ( ryan o'neal ) and studio boss jerry glover ( richard jeni ) , who spend virtually the entire film narrating the story while painfully unfunny things go on around them . 

it's bad enough that burn hollywood burn has -- literally -- not a single laugh for its entire , blissfully brief 84 minutes . 

what makes it even worse is eszterhas' insistence upon telling every bad joke not once , but twice or even three times . 

michael ovitz references , showgirls references , oral sex references , whoopi goldberg/ted danson references -- all show up multiple times with all the subtlety that is eszterhas' stock-in-trade . 

the reduncancy even manages to turn actively offensive with some frequency , notably with the hilarious use of the word "" feminist "" as an identifying caption for every single female character in the film . 

by the time coolio and chuck d show up as black independent film-makers the brothers brothers ( cleverly identified as "" bad a-- "" and "" badder a-- "" , among other unprintable things ) , you may be ready to walk out of the theater with your coat over your head to avoid being identified . 

those documentary captions , for all their leaden obviousness , allow the best insight into what's so hideously wrong with burn hollywood burn . 

not content to stick any hollywood type with only one jab from his rapier wit , eszterhas fills the screen with bullet points every time a new character appears . 

the producer is a "" liar "" who "" slept in the white house ; "" the media are "" maggots "" and "" leeches "" working for publications like "" the new york slimes "" and "" newsleak "" ( with the camera zooming in on the altered title to make sure you don't miss the joke ) . 

it doesn't even matter that eszterhas tags "" penile implant "" after his own name when he makes a cameo , because it seems like such a desperate attempt to feign self-deprecation . 

this is a petulant schoolboy's idea of satire -- pictures of hollywood insiders to which eszterhas has taken a pen to draw little moustaches and black out the teeth . 

the last stomach-churning straw comes when burn hollywood burn closes with out-takes over the closing credits , the kind that show the audience how much fun everyone was having making the film that just sucked an hour and a half of your life away . 

perhaps it was just a final , desperate attempt by eszterhas to convince himself there was some purpose behind the film , or to convince everyone involved that a few blown lines warranted threatening to blow their whole career . 

pity everyone involved with this excessive , ego-driven "" satire "" of excess and ego . 

it's too bad that only directors can remove their names from noxious material like this . 

otherwise , you might have seen credits for burn hollywood burn overflowing with alan smithees .

"underwater science fiction stays submerged 

sphere a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman 

one of the most unpleasant experiences that can occur in a movie theater is when a cast of fine actors end up in a film that wastes their talents . 

you keep thinking what they might have accomplished with the time they squandered . 

psychologist norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) is called to the middle of the pacific ocean to work with the survivors of a plane crash . 

when he arrives at the site , he discovers that there is no plane , but rather an enormous spacecraft that has been sitting 1 , 000 feet below the surface for almost 300 years . 

having written a paper for the bush administration on how to handle first contact , he is chosen to head up the team of scientists investigating the ship . 

his group as outlined in his report , consists of beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist ; harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , a mathematician ; and ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist . 

unfortunately it turns out that the writing was a blow-off project for goodman who did it for the money and named his then-colleagues to the team . 

 "" after all , "" he explains , "" who reads government documents ? "" 

lead by harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , a top secret federal operative , the group descends to a mobile undersea headquarters set up next to the alien vessel . 

once there they stroll over , knock on the door and explore the still-operational ufo . 

discovering the surprising origin of the ship and the crew finds an astonishing gigantic golden liquid metal sphere . 

when adams enters the sphere , the weirdness unfolds . 

a storm rolls in on the surface and the team is forced to remain below just as an unseen presence begins to communicate through their computer . 

 "" my name is jerry . 

i am happy "" flashes across the screen . 

this is unsettling for the psychologist . 

 "" what happens if jerry gets mad ? "" he asks . 

barnes is more pragmatic : he needs a last name because he can't put in his report that they made contact with an alien named jerry . 

then the situation turns bad . 

deadly beasts appear from nowhere . 

a gang of jellyfish kills one of the navy personnel . 

lethal sea snakes attack goodman . 

a giant squid batters the habitat just as adams is reading "" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea "" . 

the suspicious scientists turn against each other . 

this has all the makings of a first-rate thinking man's science fiction film . 

however even the finest ingredients don't go very far in the hands of a chief who doesn't seem to care about his product . 

director barry levinson has churned out a mish-mosh that doesn't engage the audience beyond a few skillful suspense scenes . 

the first of the film zooms by as the situation and players are introduced without any characterization or justification . 

it's much like speed-reading a novel and realizing that you missed the nuances . 

it doesn't get any better when the action scenes begin . 

while the actors do an adequate job with their limited roles , the people are still flat . 

oddly they hardly have reactions when deaths occur around them . 

after adams experiences the interior of the sphere , no one bothers to ask him what happened . 

their history together is an intriguing plot device but is barely exploited . 

even goodman and halperin's ill-conceived affair when she was his student is just mentioned in passing . 

her psychotic tendencies are talked about but never convincing . 

there's a truism that items shown early in a movie must be used before the ending , but here they are far too obvious . 

when an emergency mini-sub is explained , you know what's going to happen . 

the movie affectations are nothing more than distracting . 

chapter headings that divide the movie have no function . 

the shaky camera work muddies already perplexing chaos . 

much of what goes on is confusing and difficult to follow . 

although some of the disorientation eventually is understandable , a great deal of it isn't . 

even a science fiction film must be internally consistent . 

there's too much here that doesn't make sense . 

are the manifestations real ? 

the jellyfish kill queen latifa ( in a throw-away role ) and the squid nearly destroys the outpost , but the bites of the fatal snakes have no effect . 

a scene in the sub suggests that it's illusion , but earlier episodes indicate that it's not . 

not everything has to be explained to death , but there are major questions that the film never answers . 

where the ship came from is clarified , but how it ended up on the ocean floor in 1709 is merely alluded to . 

even the enigmatic sphere is still mysterious when the credits roll . 

the climax is followed by 15 minutes of epilogue that does little but weaken the already labored tale . 

after pre-release audience testing , the actors were called back to re-shoot the ending . 

it's difficult to imagine how the original could have been worse . 

following the recent tradition of lengthy films , this weighs in at over two very long hours . 

the weak scenes could have been cut , but then there wouldn't have been much left . 

the movie was supposedly held up by effects work , but there's nothing special on the screen . 

we never even see the monstrous squid or the menacing storm . 

stealing from "" alien "" , "" the abyss "" and the disastrous "" event horizon "" , this film has learned nothing from them . 

remarkably levinson and hoffman's other currently showing film is "" wag the dog "" , a smart and entertaining piece of work . 

this one could have been titled the same sans one word .

add in overly broad performances and some laughable lipsynching by panaro , and you're left with one astonishing piece of cinematic damage .

"tone alone cannot sustain a film , but it can go a long way .

when that tone is backed up by an outstanding story and great acting , the effect can be described best by an adjective i do not use lightly : "" literary . "" 

what's eating gilbert grape ? 

is such a film . 

it's a rich , memorable and stunningly acted story of desire colliding with responsibility , staged in a manner which many viewers might find too prosaic , but which insinuated itself into my imagination with its confidence . 

gilbert grape ( johnny depp ) is a young man living in rural endora , iowa , facing incredible responsibilities . 

as the man of the house since his father's suicide , gilbert must support the family by working at the local grocery store . 

he also must watch over his mentally handicapped brother arnie ( leonardo dicaprio ) and help care for his extremely overweight mother ( darlene cates ) . 

gilbert seems destined to spend the rest of his life in the small town until the arrival in endora of becky ( juliette lewis ) , a free spirit passing through with her grandmother when their truck breaks down . 

as he spends time with becky , gilbert begins to think about all the things he is missing . 

slowly his resentment builds , until he realizes that he can no longer live his entire life for other people . 

director lasse hallstrom ( my life as a dog ) and legendary cinematographer sven nykvist create a magnificent visual backdrop for peter hedges' screenplay , based on his own novel . 

endora is a town on the edge of the world represented by the giant foodmart , a tiny insular community where everyone knows everyone else . 

the midwestern sunsets and sprawling fields are beautifully photographed , and the atmosphere of the town is intensely real . 

minor characters , like crispin glover as the town's mortician , are vividly realized , and there are echoes of the last picture show in mary steenburgen's desperately unhappy housewife . 

one of the most perfectly realized scenes focuses on the grand opening of a burger franchise , attended by the entire town and accompanied by the off-key high school band . 

not a single note in the depiction of endora rang false . 

the same can be said of the character of gilbert . 

it's testimony to the precision involved in his creation that he came together completely with one perfectly placed line , when becky responds to gilbert's description of his father with , "" i knew someone like that once . "" 

gilbert is a man harboring an ever-growing bitterness about where he finds himself in life , a bitterness which reveals itself in moments of surprising cruelty . 

in one scene , he allows local children to look at his mother through their window , displaying her like a side show attraction . 

his entire life seems to be mocked by arnie's repeated chants of , "" we're not going anywhere , "" but instead of expressing his dissatisfaction he lets his anger simmer , and it becomes clear that he is following in his father's footsteps in this regard . 

johnny depp expertly demonstrates the tension central to gilbert by playing everything below the surface , but he never gives in to one-dimensional blankness or simply regurgitates his naif roles in benny & joon and edward scissorhands . 

depp's performance is overshadowed , however , by leonardo dicaprio's astonishing oscar-nominated supporting work as arnie . 

he puts to shame such big name actors as john malkovich and dustin hoffman , whose mentally challenged characters never seemed completely real . 

dicaprio is perfect to the last twitch and squeal , and anyone who has ever spent time with mentally challenged kids will be hard-pressed to spot a flaw . 

darlene cates , a first-time actor , brings real pain to her scenes as gilbert's tortured mother , and laura harrington and mary kate schellhardt are solid as gilbert's sisters . 

only juliette lewis doesn't quite click , playing a critical role with her now familiar dopey drone and too little genuine spark . 

gilbert grape does seem to drift into its conclusion , but it never lost me . 

thanks to a lovingly created setting and a marvelous cast , this 1993 release proves well worth the wait .

"susan granger's review of "" america's sweethearts "" ( columbia/sony ) 

what a waste of a talented cast ! 

billy crystal and co-writer peter tolan have concocted a sly , provocative premise and , as the opening credits roll , it's obvious that they're attempting an old-fashioned romantic comedy . 

the story involves a veteran publicist ( billy crystal ) who is summoned to orchestrate a press junket in las vegas when an arrogant director ( christopher walken ) holds a megabuck movie hostage in his editing room , refusing to show it to anyone . 

he figures that by giving the journalists juicy hints of a possible reconciliation between the film's once-married-but-now-estranged stars , gwen and eddie ( catherine zeta-jones , john cusack ) , they'll be so distracted that they won't remember they didn't see the movie or it wasn't what they expected . 

 ( and crystal thought of this long before a sony exec concocted the phony critic/david manning quote scandal ! ) 

for help , he turns to gwen's personal assistant/sister ( julia roberts ) . 

but the laughs are few and far-between . 

crystal's glib , cynical flack isn't wickedly funny enough with a few amusing one-liners . 

after six months under the care of a depak chopra-like guru ( alan arkin ) , cusack's character's too emotionally fragile , lacking the necessary charisma . 

zeta-jones's vain , narcissistic diva is undeveloped and one-dimensional . 

only hank azaria , as zeta-jones's much-macho spanish lover , and stanley tucci , as a studio exec , and roberts manage to whip up any farcical froth . 

basically , we don't like these ego-driven , stereotypical characters , let alone root for them to unwind their romantic entanglements , and joe roth's direction is predictable , formulaic and telegraphic . 

on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" america's sweethearts "" is a contrived , shallow 4 . as a screwball satire , it's strictly superficial . 
"
"scream 2 isn't quite as clever as its predecessor , but it fills the gap with a cutting wit . 

death -- even gruesome , bloody death -- can be funny if handled the right way ( some will be offended by this statement , but you need look no further than pulp fiction for an example ) . 

and , while there's plenty of horror to go around in scream 2 , the latest '90s slasher flick incarnation , there are also a few laughs to be had . 

scream 2 is a slice-and-dice movie for those who don't take their horror too seriously . 

the success of the original scream took everyone in the industry by surprise . 

the unexpected blockbuster , whose gross soared over the $100 million mark during its six month release window , opened just about a year ago and turned into one of the most profitable horror films of all time . 

a sequel was inevitable ; fortunately , nearly the entire creative team has returned for scream 2 , including director wes craven , screenwriter kevin williamson , and actors neve campbell , courtney cox , david arquette , jamie kennedy , and liev schreiber . 

as stipulated by one of the "" rules of sequels "" uttered by a movie- obsessed character in the film , the body count in scream 2 is higher than that in the original . 

paradoxically , there's a lot less gore . 

there is blood , of course , but nothing excessive by slasher-movie standards , and there are no depictions of spilled entrails . 

craven has remembered that scares are more important that graphic displays of human insides and bodily fluids . 

a second strength of scream 2 is that it features a gallery of legitimate characters rather than a group of cardboard cut-out stereotypes lined up for slaughter . 

after all , we've known some of these people for two movies -- it's almost impossible not to care about them at least a little . 

scream 2 opens approximately two years after the original . 

as in the first picture , there's a slick , self-mocking prologue . 

this time , the victims are jada pinkett and omar epps , whose characters are visiting a local theater for a preview screening of the movie stab ( which is based on the "" true life "" events of scream ) . 

some of the smartest dialogue comes during this sequence as pinkett bemoans the lack of african american participation in horror films ( it's surely no coincidence that , in addition to pinkett and epps , scream 2 features two black characters ) . 

shortly thereafter , she and her boyfriend have been gutted , signaling the beginning of a series of copycat murders . 

craven lets loose a burst of tongue-in-cheek creativity for the "" movie within a movie "" sequences . 

they give him an opportunity to openly parody scream -- an act that he accomplishes with great panache . 

stab features heather graham in the "" casey becker "" role ( played in the original by drew barrymore ) and tori spelling as "" sidney prescott "" ( neve campbell ) . 

sadly , we only see a couple of scenes from stab . 

it would have been a little more fun , i think , had craven used joe dante's approach from matinee and shown lengthy excerpts from his satirical production . 

following the prologue , we are re-introduced to sidney prescott , who has left her sleepy hometown to go to windsor college . 

her friend randy ( jamie kennedy ) is a student there as well , and he's just as knowledgeable about horror films as ever . 

once the double murder at stab becomes big news , the media converges on windsor , looking to interview the original victim . 

at the head of the flock of vultures is gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who has a little surprise for sidney . 

she has brought cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , the man sidney falsely accused of murder , with her . 

also arriving at the college is deputy dewey ( david arquette ) , who is there to act as a big brother to sidney during this latest round of tribulations . 

in addition to the survivors from the original scream , the field of potential victims is well-populated . 

there's a blond co-ed named cece ( sarah michelle gellar , who has now appeared in two of williamson's movies -- this one and i know what you did last summer ) ; sidney's requisite boyfriend , derek ( jerry o'connell ) ; a local newswoman ( laurie metcalf ) ; gale's new cameraman ( duane martin ) ; a british drama teacher ( david warner ) ; and several sorority sisters and would-be sorority sisters ( portia de rossi , rebecca gayheart , elise neal , marisol nichols ) . 

ultimately , there are lots of attractive corpses . 

from the stab scenes to lines like "" brothers don't last long in situations like this , "" craven and williamson are clearly having a lot of fun with scream 2 , and the movie is enjoyable , if a little overlong ( the livelier first hour is better than the second ) . 

their resolution to the obligatory "" whodunit ? "" 

is less of a letdown than it could be , and knowingly offers a wink and nod at past unmasking scenes . 

 ( "" nice twist , "" quips the killer . 

 "" didn't see it coming , didya ? "" ) 

one senses , however , that , by the end of this picture , the overall concept of a hip , self-referential slasher film has been played out . 

supposedly , there's going to be a scream 3 , but , if the film makers don't come up with something radical , we could end up with a classic case of sequel overkill .

"the following review encompasses two versions of dune : 

dune : the theatrical version ( 1984 ) runtime : 137 minutes capsule review : cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives , the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book . 

the film's visual splendour , mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative . 

dune : the extended version ( 1988 ) runtime : 189 minutes capsule review : a bit of a throw-together assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television . 

it was disowned by director david lynch but it's considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline . 

quality dubs of this version from the out-of-print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web . 

 * * * the review * * * 

released in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of $40 million , the film of frank herbert's cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by sci-fi fans . 

director david lynch ( blue velvet , eraserhead , twin peaks ) was working on his biggest production to date , a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico . 

the screenplay was lynch's own , chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected . 

dune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors . 

the key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis ( dune ) , a windswept desert planet that's home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange . 

the spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe . 

it extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it . 

most importantly , it allows the navigators of the spacing guild ( once human but now hideously mutated ) to "" fold space "" and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously , enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish . 

lynch's film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story's two main strands . 

one is the long-standing rivalry between two families , houses atreides and house harkonnen , and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis . 

the second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long-awaited by the natives of arrakis , the fremen . 

the deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld , and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom . 

unfortunately , this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film , which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended . 

the thinking among universal's oh-so-wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office . 

with lynch's initial cut running at closer to three or more hours , the studio demanded that further cuts be made . 

what a great idea ! 

why not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible ? 

the most glaring consequence of this one-eyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative , leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters . 

thus their personalities are vague , their motivations unclear and , in the case of paul's father duke leto , their demise rather meaningless . 

the end result is a distinct chill : we can't warm to most of the cast and we don't care much for them . 

and it hardly helps that the voice-over narration is sparse and that the dune-esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book . 

dune is also a very serous film . 

the constant "" self-talk "" by various characters makes it so serious and self-absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment . 

the overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them . 

humour - or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen's mad , sadistic kind - is hard to find . 

you may balk at the comparison , but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus' star wars trilogy . 

the theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster , however . 

it still possesses enough of lynch's stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative sci-fi . 

special effects whiz carlo rambaldi's giant sandworms are an awesome sight . 

both the production design ( anthony masters ) and costume design ( bob ringwood ) are striking and original . 

and the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years . 

with these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis' lush cinematography , the film is at least a feast for the senses . 

see it in the widescreen format if you can . 

and despite all the cuts , several cast members still make a strong impression , most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen . 

sian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam , leader of the bene gesserit religious order who's secret aim is to manipulate paul's destiny for its own shadowy ends . 

as paul atreides , the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily , but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade . 

the conclusion ? 

any assessment of this film must take into account that frank herbert's original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker . 

david lynch took a brave stab at it and , partly due to forces beyond his control , ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects . 

dune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release . 

many chose to stay away altogether , as the film's disastrous box office showing attests . 

the extended version , however , is a rather different beast . 

in 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition "" director's cut "" of the film on home video , a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres . 

but , alas , he failed to do so , choosing to move on to other projects . 

in a way , then , it is partly lynch's own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version , put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa . 

stung into action , lynch successfully petitioned the director's guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with "" allen smithee "" , the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work . 

he also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous "" judas booth "" . 

certainly , looking at the results of mca's handiwork there's at least half a dozen instances that , for sheer technical sloppiness , are good enough reasons for the director to object . 

but these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas . 

most of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration , both of which fill many holes in the original version's storyline . 

paul's relationship with his father and associates is more intimate , with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously . 

the political skulduggery involving the emperor , the spacing guild , the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained . 

paul's initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably . 

and as further background , a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the dune universe . 

as a piece of storytelling , then , mca tv's version of dune is clearly superior . 

as a piece of editing , however , it is at times surprisingly inept . 

the use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough , but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate . 

there's some sloppy cutting , too , and in a few instances shots even appear out of order . 

and the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes ( eg . 

ships coming and going , soldiers coming and going ) is at times clearly out-of-context . 

this is the kind of thing to which lynch objected , and rightly so . 

it should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u . s . television . 

but the most notable omission is a gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasn't even in herbert's book . 

the scene features baron harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his "" heart plug "" . 

its a surreal and disturbing episode that's very lynch-esque but adds nothing to what we already know : the baron is a nasty piece of work . 

despite its own peculiar flaws , then , the extended version of dune is a generally superior film . 

all up , it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered , fabricated or newly created sequences . 

unless the idiosyncratic lynch has a sudden change of heart , the "" alan smithee "" version remains the closest we'll get to what the movie should have been . 

on repeated viewings , one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit . 

still , as one of this century's great science-fiction novels , some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved a better fate in its transfer to the screen . 

with rumours circulating of a new six hour mini-series planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in 1998 , it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga . 
"
"coinciding with the emerging popularity of movies that deal with anything related to serial killers , relentless , 1989 low budget thriller about lapd detective sam dietz , played by character actor leo rossi , spawned three more sequels . 

relentless 3 , third in the row , features sam dietz again , but this time detective , who had to catch vicious serial killer in his very first case , doesn't want to deal with similar line of work . 

divorced , demoralised and transferred , he reluctantly returns to his old post when los angeles becomes a hunting ground for another serial killer , and evidence indicate connection with one of dietz's old cases . 

to make things even more interesting , it seems that the killer deliberately stages murders in order to bring dietz to the investigation . 

fans of the british tv films and mini-series like prime suspect or cracker would probably see a lot of similarities relentless series of movies . 

they both feature vicious psychopathic killers , yet also give a lot of , usually depressive , details about chief investigator's private lives . 

this one isn't an exception , but similarities with british television are only in content . 

the execution and style is different , which makes this film mediocre piece of entertainment at best . 

useless , gratuitous erotica also doesn't help either , obviously making this film longer than it should be . 

the actors are good , though - leo rossi is fine as usual , and william forsythe plays one of more compelling villains in his career . 

signy coleman as dietz's love interest , is , on the other hand , quite miscast . 

but she won't have to worry about it in the future career , since relentless 3 wasn't supposed to be anybody's finest moment anyway .

"my first exposure to the nightmare on elm street series of films was not this one , but in fact the third installment ( it was the first to gain a national theatrical release ) . 

i didn't see the first film until much later . 

so looking back , the original didn't hold a lot of great memories for me , since i didn't think too much of it when i initially saw it . 

watching it now for a second time confirmed that it's an overrated horror film that ultimately makes no sense whatsoever . 

you all know the story by now : child murderer freddy krueger ( robert englund ) returns from the grave by haunting the dreams of the children of those who burned him alive years before . 

this first installment does an adequate job with it's low budget , but there's some absurd dialogue and conceptual problems with the story . 

plus the movie's ending ( understandably the result of the studio wanting the end of the film to have a "" hook "" for a sequel ) renders the rest of the film pointless . 

and does anyone understand what happens to nancy's mother at the end of this film ? 

don't get me wrong though . . . 

it's not as if a new generation of horror films have spurned me away from the classics . 

most horror movies released today are just as inane as this film is . 

horror is a difficult genre to pull off credibly , and a nightmare on elm street just doesn't cut it . 

a nightmare on elm street is available on dvd from new line home video . 

it is available both as a single disc and as part of the nightmare on elm street collection box set . 

the film is presented in both pan and scan and it's original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 78 : 1 ( although on the disc that comes in the box set , only a widescreen transfer is provided ) . 

the film has been digitally remastered and includes two options for audio : a mono mix and a new dolby digital 5 . 1 mix . 

also included on the dvd is a full-length audio commentary track with writer/director wes craven , stars john saxon and heather langenkamp , and the film's director of photography . 

other extras include the "" jump to a nightmare "" feature ( i'm sure you can figure that one out ) , the usual cast and crew bios ( which are from the film's original press release kit , and notably leave out robert englund and johnny depp ! ) , and the film's original theatrical trailer . 

some dvd-rom features are also included , but since i don't have dvd-rom capabilities i can't really get into that . 

the commentary track is entertaining and informative , but nothing spectacular . 

the first thing of note is that it's the same commentary track that was on the special edition laserdisc from a few years ago . 

i'm not saying that's a negative thing , just pointing it out . 

everyone seems enthusiastic about being there , with the possible exception of john saxon , who just doesn't say much at all . 

most of the time you'll forget he's even there . 

everyone else talks really quietly though for some reason , as if because they're commenting on a scary movie that they need to stay as quiet as possible . 

the bonus disc with the boxed set called the nightmare series encyclopedia features about 45 minutes worth of interviews relating to the first film of the series . 

also included is the original theatrical trailer and two alternate endings to the film . . . 

however you can only access one easily . 

the other is hidden in what's called "" the labyrinth "" , which might possibly be the most annoying feature of a dvd ever created . 

basically , it's an interactive game of sorts where you wander through different nightmare locations looking at objects which give you access to extra little snippets of footage , interviews , etc . somewhere in the labyrinth is the second alternate ending to the film . 

finding it though is both a chore and a bore .

"an american werewolf in london is john landis' groundbreaking feature about an american tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old england . 

the groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects . 

more specifically , the makeup used for the transformation of a man into a werewolf ; and for the ghosts that haunt the main character . 

even twenty years after its release , that part of the movie is still impressive . 

although , i would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie that could be considered impressive . 

the rest of the movie is a run of the mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure . 

if it weren't for the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf transformation it is most likely that this is a film that would have gone largely unnoticed when it was released back in 1980 . 

and with good reason -- the acting isn't great and neither is the writing . 

well ok , we don't actually expect either of those things to be great in a horror film . 

but one other important element is lacking here too -- it isn't scary . 

with no exception , you know what is going to happen before it happens . 

you don't even need the obligatory scary music to give you a hint . 

i will give director john landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that i have ever seen . 

but john , it just wasn't scary . 

i didn't know if this was intended to be some sort of romantic drama and the whole werewolf thing was just thrown in to get people to come to the theater to see it , but it didn't work for me . 

actually , it was intended as a sort of a spoof on horror films . 

but the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama was so bad ; the intended humor was lost on me . 

it's never a good sign that you don't realize a movie is supposed to be funny until after the movie is long over and you read it in the background material . 

call me crazy , but you shouldn't have to do research on a movie to enjoy it . 

i'm not even going to get into the plot of the movie that much , since the title pretty well sums the whole thing up . 

werewolf bites boy ( david naughton ) . 

boy ends up in hospital where he is tended to and eventually falls for pretty nurse ( jenny agutter ) and then strange things begin to happen to boy . 

including , and i must admit this is a very nice touch , visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him in the hospital . 

the neat thing here is that his buddy is a rapidly deteriorating corpse . 

i know it sounds strange , but it actually works . 

the scenes between david naughton and the dead buddy ( griffin dunne ) are really the best parts of the movie . 

as i said , probably the only reason that this film was a hit was because of the special effects . 

while they are still impressive today , they aren't impressive enough , or plentiful enough to warrant watching this film . 

and since they are more or less the highlight of the film , there are far better choices out there if you want a scary movie to curl up with your sweetheart to watch . 

actually , the 1998 sequel , an american werewolf in paris , is more entertaining since it doesn't take itself as seriously and actually provides a few more laughs along the way .

"the original babe gets my vote as the best family film since the princess bride , and it's sequel has been getting rave reviews from most internet critics , both siskel and ebert sighting it more than a month ago as one of the year's finest films . 

so , naturally , when i entered the screening room that was to be showing the movie and there was nary another viewer to be found , this notion left me puzzled . 

it is a rare thing for a children's movie to be praised this highly , so wouldn't you think that every parent in the entire city would be flocking with their kids to see this supposedly "" magical "" piece of work ? 

a tad bewildered , but pleased to not have to worry about screaming kids and other disruptions that commonly go along with family films , i sat back for 97 minutes and watched intently and with a very open mind , having great expectations for the film . 

looking back , i should have taken the hint and left right when i entered the theater . 

believe me ; i wanted to like babe : pig in the city . 

the plot seemed interesting enough ; after the events that took place in the original , babe the sheep-pig has become a legitimate national phenomenon . 

but after a fateful encounter with a water well , arthur hogget ( james cromwell , who the movie could have used alot more of ) has been rendered bed-ridden for a number of weeks and the farm begins to go under financially . 

the only solution that his wife ( magda szubanski , going from delightfully charming to downright annoying ) can come up with is to make an appearance with their new celebrity pet at a national fair ( i think ) and to use the money they earn to pay off the bank ( set aside for the moment the fact that they could get more than enough cash from donations if they just made their case known to the public ) . 

problem is , the fair is being held in the middle of the dreaded "" city "" , a completely foreign place to both the pig and his companion . 

setting the main plot in motion , mrs . hogget and babe travel to the unnamed city and shack up with a sweet lady who just happens to love to help animals , despite the law that you cannot keep them in hotels . 

it is here that we meet an array of eccentric characters , the most memorable being the family of chimps led by steven wright . 

here is where the film took a wrong turn . 

up until this point , i had being having a rather enjoyable experience . 

the beginning featured some smart writing and funny situations involving the farm animals from the first one and even an inspired moment at the airport where mrs . hogget is accused of smuggling drugs . 

unfortunately , the story wears thin as we are introduced to a new set of animals that reside at the hotel , none of them being even one-tenth as interesting as the characters from the previous babe . 

the main topic of discussion surrounding babe : pig in the city is the question of whether or not it is to dark and disturbing for small children , and i believe it is . 

at one point , a dog is hung from his neck and slowly starts to drown . 

at other times , we are treated to surrealistic flash-backs to mrs . hogget's full cavity search at the airport . 

in fact , the overall tone of the movie is rather bleak and depressing . 

however , that is , as they say , neither here nor there because kids will probably not like the movie anyway . 

the animal characters and their plights were simply not intriguing enough to sustain my interest for an hour and a half , let alone entertain a child . 

another problem i found with the film was it's sudden change of pacing and tone near the end of the story . 

if you're going to make a darker and more sinister sequel , fine . 

it may not be my cup of tea , but at least it is a noble ambition . 

but to go from the downbeat feel of the rest of the movie and all of a sudden have slapstick finale with mrs . hogget swinging from wall-to-wall of a ballroom in elastic overalls ? 

it just didn't feel right and was more painful to watch than it was funny or entertaining , and the same goes for the rest of the movie . 
"
"swashbuckling adventure that can be enjoyed by both children and adults . 

steven spielberg may not have directed ( he only executive produced ) but his touch certainly is evident in this movie . 

and he knows a money making winner when he sees one . 

the mask of zorro has the hallmarks of a blockbuster : big action , funny comedy , and the pacing of a rollercoaster . 

hopkins plays don diego de la vega , otherwise known as zorro . 

a fighter for the people , he is eventually captured by don rafael montero ( stuart wilson ) , who also , unintentionally , kills his wife . 

the film cuts to twenty years later , where vega still wants to montero dead . 

however , he's far too old now , and trains up thief alejandro murrieta ( banderas ) to become the new zorro . 

banderas motive ? 

to avenge the death of his brother , who was killed at the hands of captain love ( matthew letscher ) who rather tastefully keeps the head in a jar , in one of the more graphic scenes in this family movie . 

with the scene set , the movie goes on full blast , with sword fights a-plenty and witty one liners . 

banderas and hopkins have a marvellous chemistry as the two zorro's , playing each other off with ease . 

hopkins seems to come off a little better , but banderas does some excellent work . 

as the bad guys , wilson and letscher seem one dimensional , but they go through the bad guy shtick in an above average way . 

the audience does hate them , which can't be bad . 

catherine zeta-jones also pops up as hopkins daughter , and although she provides little more than the usual female lead , she delivers a charming , but one note , performance . 

the chemistry is excellent between banderas and jones . 

there's a delightful little scene where banderas and jones have a sword fight , and every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed , until jones clothes fall off all together . 

the director , fresh from the enjoyable goldeneye ( 1995 ) handles the film perfectly . 

the action is well done and fast paced , the comedy put across well . 

the cast help a lot , but the direction is still outstanding . 

although the film is very long , the plot keeps chugging along , and there's barely a dull moment . 

however , the film is a little over indulgent , and it could have been trimmed . 

it manages to hold the attention , thankfully , and the adventure and charm holds right up to the last reel . 

screenwriters john eskow , ted elliot and terry rosio have unfortunately written an cliched and one dimensional script . 

although they've bought zorro up to date with big explosions and wild action , the plot itself is barely existent . 

there's lots of little sub plots hanging around , but there's nothing substantial to bring them all together . 

the main story seems to be the fact that rafael wants to 'buy' california using gold stolen from the guy he's buying the land off . 

this sets up for a temple of doom type plot where we see peasants slave driven into getting the gold from little mines . 

however , this doesn't seem to appear until nearly over a hour into the film , so the film is never quite sure where it's going . 

in the end however , zorro provides action and comedy in spades . 

it suitable for everyone , so put the guilt behind , and put some more money into spielbergs bank account . 

you won't regret it .

"trailing the success of brit humour in the movie industry with the likes of the semi-dramatic the commitments and the nearly slapstick a fish called wanda , the full monty is one film which delivered the depth of the former and the humour magnitude of the latter . 

the film opens with a narrated documentary reel showing the improving economic and living standards of sheffield in the 60's , then cut to the harsh reality of the present . 

sheffield has become some sort of a semi-slum with the only visible increase in anything was the amount of layoffs from steel-factories ; a once flourishing industry . 

gaz ( carlyle ) spends most of his time in the worker's club , a sort of place where jobless people sit around to wait for job offers . 

he and his `plump' friend dave ( addy ) as well as their former foreman gerald ( wilkinson ) have been sitting around the club for months without any `call for duty' . 

what seemingly was just a passing hard time for gaz suddenly transformed itself into desperation when he cannot afford the 700 pounds of child-support money to his ex-wife . 

suddenly finding himself facing the possiblity of losing custody of his son , he goes on to concoct an enterprising wild-idea to get the money he desperately requires . 

dave and gerald too have problems of their own . 

on top of his lack of employment , dave is also faced with the paranoia of his wife leaving him because of his current financial state as well as his`plump' appearance while gerald have been cheating on his wife by not telling her of his layoff for as long as 6 months , leaving home for `work' when he was actually a long-standing member of the worker's club . 

there we have it ; people with real problems and a not-so-practical solution for them . 

gaz manages to get the support from them and sure enough they managed to get a few other poor jobless blokes to join in their gag : to perform a strip-act at the local pub . 

in gaz's own words while looking at an add for a strip-act featuring hunky `beautiful' men , `if women are willing to pay for this , they sure as well will pay for real-men' . 

the full monty is very simple in nature and not a trace ambitious at all . 

it is a small film which delves in the harsh-reality of unemployment and the desperation it drives people to . 

it also is a very light movie to watch despite the theme it delves in because it has a lot of human-factor going for it . 

never for once , was it trying to be manipulative at all , the full monty was true to itself all the way . 

while the hilarity level of this film soared unexpectedly high , audience will find that they are in no way being cheated of a laugh , something lacking in many comedy films ( wannabes ? ) from hollywood . 

other than carlyle , who acted as the psychotic begbie in trainspotting , the rest of the actors were definitely very new to me on-screen . 

however , the acting presented in this film is more than satisfying . 

carlyle's work here is a stark contrast to his character in trainspotting , implying real acting skill and flexibility on-screen . 

kudos to the people involved in this film , especially to director peter cattaneo for being able to put together an excellent film which is has so much potential in ending up as your just-another-striptease . 

already a critical and financial success for such a small film , the full monty is a humble film which deserves applause throughout . 

while titanic managed to feast the eyes and soul in an epic way , the full monty gives one the same satisfaction ? ? . in 

half the time .

"a movie that's been as highly built up as the truman show , with reviews boasting , "" the film of the decade ! "" 

and "" a breakthrough ! "" 

can only be leading up to letdown . 

that's no doubt -- it seems any movie with critical acclaim makes you think you're going in for the ride of your life , that you'll end up changed on the other side , and you come out of the theater going , "" eh . . . 

 * that's * what all the fuss was about ? "" 

so , naturally , the truman show was building up to what was going to be a dissapointment . 

and i convinced myself , as i nestled into my uncomfortable movie theater chair , actually to try not to enjoy it . 

let me tell you , that is an impossibilty . 

the truman show is truly "" the film of the decade "" and "" a breakthrough "" and more . 

and you will come out changed on the other side . 

such a movie comes around only once in a lifetime , where you find yourself feeling everything that the character is feeling , and this , friends , is it . 

jim carrey shows that he doesn't need to talk out of his butt to entertain us ; that he can be as dramatic as any of hollywood's leading men . 

the film has a difficult premise to tackle , trying to set us up thirty years into the "" truman show's "" run , but tackle it it does , and perfectly . 

with flashbacks actually being flashbacks on the television show , you get the sense that you are viewing a * real * prime-time hit . 

and the way the camera constantly takes the forms it would in the "" real "" truman show is clever and well-done . 

people , rejoice ! 

this is the first oscar-worthy film of not only this year , but of the last five years . 

not since "" schindler's list "" has a movie captured human spirit and true despair so well . 

this is a classic in the making , and ( to borrow a line from esquire's review ) it stars jim carrey . 

nothing in his career to date and nothing he can do in the future will ever be able to top his role as truman burbank ; mark my word . 

for , as i said , this is the movie of a lifetime and the role is of the same calibre . 

forget special-effect ladden summer fodder . 

drop your romantic comedies in the trash . 

toss your thrillers and teen flicks on the pile . 

you need nothing more than "" the truman show "" to carry you through the summer , or for that matter , the year . 

oh ! and in case i don't see you , good afternoon , good evening , and goodnight .

"perhaps best remembered as the recently departed news anchor on saturday night live who always started the segment with "" . . . this is the fake news , "" norm macdonald , at times , could elicit some laughter by blurting out semi-offensive phrases in his raspy voice , coated with a condescending attitude . 

his shtick was marked by crassness . 

in this movie , for example , when his girlfriend says that she's kicking him out because he's been fired from 14 different jobs over the last 3 months , he tries to calm the situation by saying , "" maybe you'll feel better after we have some dirty sex . "" 

this kind of humor can only go so far , but certainly can't go the distance in a full-length feature . 

 "" dirty work "" , is nothing more than a sophomoric comedy about two best friends who grow up only physically . 

emotionally , they've never outgrown their pubescent years , which is somewhat amusingly explored in a beginning flashback . 

although having no apparent real world skills , the one thing that these two have always been adept at is getting back at people . 

if the meter maid was unjust in giving you a ticket , then dump a bunch of unpopped kernels of corn onto the engine block and watch the car burst apart . 

mitch ( norm macdonald ) and sam ( artie lange ) need to come up with $50 , 000 in a period of two weeks so that sam's dad ( jack warden ) can have a heart operation . 

their idea is to start a revenge-for-hire business where they'll do your dirty work . 

in the funniest scene ( and possibly the only funny scene ) of the movie , they take advantage of a live television shoot at a nearby used car lot . 

their presence is established , but when a less-than-honorable real estate developer hires them and then reneges on the payment , the two go to work to exact their sordid brand of revenge . 

by default , dirty work should treat us to some outrageous revenge plots , but it delivers jerky boys level material . 

except for the bit at the used car lot ( and possibly another episode that involves frat brothers ) , the dirty work is uninspired and becomes about as funny as a prank phone call . 

already weak on material , it further spirals itself towards the video store by having jack warden constantly blurt out that he has an unsatisfied libido and needs 'broads' and also includes a very unfunny chevy chase as a bumbling doctor with a gambling addiction . 

but what's really painfully evident is that norm macdonald has no versatility as an actor . 

relying on his trademark of speaking into his personal recorder and saying "" note to self "" ( "" note to self : learn to fight , "" he says after getting beat up ; "" note to self : there's always beer , "" he says after hitting rock bottom ; etc . ) , we feel like we're just watching an elongated rehash of his not-so-glorious days on saturday night live . 

much like the television show , for 90 minutes we get one or two funny bits . 

the rest of the story is just dead space . 
"
"you've seen this moment before , recently : a particularly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing . 

the difference is that when it happens to lili taylor's nell in the haunting , we don't care . 

the hero of the sixth sense , a young boy named cole , is a rich creation , and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike . 

the seasons have changed since an ex-patient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe ( willis ) in the comfort of his own bedroom . 

desperate to get his career back on track , even at the expense of his crumbling marriage ( to williams , of rushmore ) , malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole ( osment ) . 

the preteen displays all the quirks of malcolm's would-be killer : scars on his body ; antisocial behaviour ; and the reluctance to reveal a big secret . 

only after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies ( and hospitalized as a result ) does he divulge to malcolm , in a spine-tingling scene , that he sees dead people walking among us , all the time . 

malcolm assumes , and given his profession , reasonably so , that cole is schizophrenic , not psychic , but the sincerity in cole's anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures . 

he will instead pursue the supernatural angle , becoming a kind of surrogate father to cole ( who lives with his single mother , lynn ( collette ) ) in the process . 

the sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist . 

 ( though shyamalan does , somewhat unforgiveably , crib the self-rearranging kitchen business from the latter . ) 

it's far more heartwarming than frightening , and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks . 

cole attracts the dead for reasons unknown , but they're not out to harm him , really-they just want to be heard , even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler . 

perhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us , at first , than they really are because we're looking at the situation through the eyes of an eight-year-old . 

that's right : willis , for the first time in years , gives up the spotlight to his costar . 

we appreciate malcolm's domestic dilemma , but we identify with cole , recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed . 

both actors deliver immensely likable performances , and their dynamic is manifest . 

willis convinces us that he's a doctor , something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night . 

osment is phenomenal , a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do . 

the sixth sense ( atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs' cinematographer , tak fujimoto ) is actually a drama-its spooky , effective ad campaign is misleading . 

only because i was expecting something different did i notice-rather , feel-the movie's running time , which is just shy of two hours . 

the story unfurls slowly but engrossingly ; its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait . 

i'm not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof , but i admired its audacity . 
"
" "" . . . because i'm a scientist . 

that's what we do ! "" 

--- dr . alexander mccabe ( bob gunton ) , in response to why he created evil bats . 

alright folks , stop me if you've heard this one : genetically altered animals wreak havoc on a town and a small band of locals , assisted by a specialist in the particular animal's field , must team up to stop the mutant creatures before they can multiply and spread across the earth . 

oh yeah , the military is on their way to bomb the town as well , so they are running short on time . 

sound familiar ? 

such is the plot of the destination films release of bats . 

dina meyer stars as the "" bat specialist "" sheila , who is pulled from her research ( along with her annoying sidekick , played with irritating deftness by leon ) in order to help a small texas town figure out why some local citizens and animals have been chewed to death recently . 

with the help of the local sheriff ( lou diamond phillips ) , a cdc official ( carlos jacott ) , and a scientist ( bob gunton ) , sheila discovers it is indeed bats ( who have been genetically altered by gunton's character to be more aggressive and omnivorous , in order to be used as a military weapon ! ) . 

i have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film . 

there's not a frame of promotional footage i have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good . 

in this respect , the film never disappointed me . 

this film reaches a level that transcends the "" so bad it's good "" level and borders on the downright insane . 

the effects are awful , the script is contrived , and for most of the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously ( i think ) . 

i challenge anyone to sit through the scene , where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner , with a straight face . 

thankfully , the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with . 

dina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in ( johnny mnemonic , dragonheart , and starship troopers . . . 

the latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit ) , and this one is no exception . 

while one never really gets the impression that meyer's character could be a bat expert in reality , one never really cares to doubt it either . 

she gives as good a performance as could be expected , plus she's nice to look at for an hour and a half . 

lou diamond phillips is also serviceable here , as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero . 

although when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for what's going on in town , for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats . 

the only bad performance in the film is that of leon's . 

he is relegated to the "" i'm not sticking around here ! "" 

character and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays . 

anyone who can't immediately tell that bob gunton ( the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films ) is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised , but i highly doubt it . 

even if he hadn't been the villain in just about every film he's ever been in , so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever . 

in fact , his death is welcome , because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale . 

if the plot doesn't sound ridiculous to you yet , then check out these little tidbits : a multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol . 

an entire town disregards the sheriff and doctor's orders to stay indoors after a curfew is instigated , causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force , killing several townsfolk . 

a government official blows off shelia's instructions ( to wait until dawn to install a cooling unit in the bats' cave that will kill all of them off ) by pulling a night job , resulting in the death of an entire military unit . 

a cavern full of bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it . 

finally , to top it all off , this little texas town is showing nosferatu in it's single screen theater ( for reference , our town has over a million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens , and we're lucky to even get kevin smith's dogma ) . 

the most laughable part of the movie though comes from the ill-conceived bat puppets . 

while the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing ( making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend what's going on ) , the scenes where a bat is called upon to interact with a live actor are usually shot more low-key . 

therefore we the audience get loving close-ups of the most unrealistic , rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film . 

being able to see the puppeteer's arms would be the only things that could have made these creations worse . 

after all of this , if you still decide bats might be the movie for you , don't say you haven't been warned . 

trust me when i say that it's a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through . 

i just wish that dina meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in . 

she's definitely a talent that is going to waste in films like these .

"in my opinion , a movie reviewer's most important task is to offer an explanation for his opinion . 

but with soul survivors , i'm so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into a venomous , uncontrollable rant , obligations damned . 

however , protocol forces me to do otherwise . 

soul survivors tells the story of four college-bound friends : cassandra ( melissa sagemiller ) is sweet and innocent . 

party girl annabel ( eliza dushku of bring it on ) is dating world-weary harvard student matt ( wes bentley ) . 

matt still has feelings for cassie , who is now dating sean ( casey affleck ) . 

driving back from a creepy , gothic party , the quartet gets into a horrific car crash . 

sean dies , leaving cassie crestfallen and guilty , made worse because sean saw matt kiss cassie just minutes after sean revealed his love for her . 

as cassie mopes through her classes , she sees the ghost of sean all over the place , urging her to follow him . 

along with being plagued by other ghastly visions , cassie is also followed by thugs from that strange party . 

annabel and matt try calming her down , but no one shares cass's visions . 

she has to figure out this purgatory all by herself . 

rarely have i seen a director so thoroughly mishandle material . 

in his directorial debut , steve carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion . 

when the movie's camerawork isn't pedestrian , it's clich ? d . 

carpenter's need for close-ups , his camera following sagemiller from behind , drain the movie of any anticipation . 

we already know what to look for , so why should we be surprised ? 

and the sense of scary atmosphere , which was recently done so well in the others , is nowhere to be found here . 

carpenter's script relies on random twists and turns with a minimum of logic and loads of laziness . 

this is a movie where the ending features one character providing an explanation about the plot to another character , which is one of the lamest screenwriting devices around . 

the second lamest device , of course , is the , "" oh , it was all a dream "" resolution . 

and guess what ? 

this movie has both ! 

not that the main body of the film , which has sagemiller constantly running in fear or having a nervous breakdown , is anything worthwhile . 

since there's no captivating dialogue , no character chemistry exists anywhere . 

that's a huge problem , since the four main characters are supposed to be couples . 

carpenter can't even get the smutty scenes right , which are becoming more prevalent in pg-13 movies like bring it on and get over it . 

[the film was recently re-cut from an r rating to get more kids in the seats . 

-ed . ] 

when sagemiller and dushku dance together at a club , he rarely shows them in a full shot and he never keeps the camera on them for longer than a second before relating to some michael bay-style quick cuts . 

and when sagemiller and dushku take a shower together after getting covered in paint , they're fully clothed . 

regardless , any sexiness in that scene is undercut by its stupidity . 

why wouldn't they wash the clothes in the sink or in the washing machine ? 

why would they shower in their clothes ? 

what if they weren't covered in latex paint ? 

the cast , which will see better material in the future , would be wise to leave this one off their resumes . 

i felt sorry for affleck , who i've liked in other movies , and bentley , who was great in american beauty . 

dushku , who possesses an alluring femme fetale quality , has got to stop taking roles belonging to rose mcgowan . 

as for sagemiller ( star of the aforementioned get over it ) , i want to see her in a movie where she plays a person , and not an object for gawking . 

and i'm not even getting into luke wilson's role as a priest . 

at least he's friends with wes anderson . 

bottom line : soul survivors is so awful i feel compelled to knock on doors and warn people about it .

" "" the end of the affair "" is a dark and moody romantic period piece , that neil jordan exquisitely writes and directs . 

although it's slow and sometimes confusing to follow , it still manages to give audiences a moving experience . 

based on graham greene's novel of the same name , the film mainly follows 3 characters . 

there's maurice bendrix ( ralph fiennes ) who has an affair with henry mile's ( stephen rea ) wife sarah ( julianne moore ) . 

sarah finds henry to be a bore , because well , he's just a normal guy . 

it's all work and no play with him . 

while maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with sarah , and would do anything for her . 

unfortunately the two break up . 

this is all witnessed in a serious of flashbacks , so that leads us to the present . 

it's a few years later , and they both still think of each other , so maurice hires a private detective ( ian hart ) to see what sarah is up too . 

while this may sound straight forward it's not . 

it's a deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men , unhappiness , and the ever lasting love . 

all this may sound like a drag , but it really captures your interest . 

with great performances by ralph fiennes ( doing another english patient type of film , only this movie is better ) and julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar because out of all 5 films she did in 1999 , i believe this was the role , she had the most passion for , and you can see why . 

the story was also well written thanks to neil jordan . 

even though i didn't read the book , there's no doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive . 

what's so moving about it you ask ? 

the tragedy of it all . 

it's not the typical romance , in which a guy finds a girl , they fall in love and all is well , this is more complicated and depressing . 

it really shows the complexity of a relationship , because nothing is ever perfect . 

everyone feels a different way and that is what tears us to pieces . 

back to neil jordan's script , it wasn't only red roses . 

there were times when i felt it too be a little slow , but most romances are . 

it also tended to be a bit confusing , especially at the start . 

it keep jumping around from past to present , so it obviously took awhile to get a grasp of things . 

also a notable was the superb direction by neil jordan . 

i'd have to say this is his finest achievement to date , because quite frankly i've never really found his work to be up to par . 

it just never did anything for me , until now . 

when it ends , it leaves viewers a little saddened , but provoked nonetheless . 

this is definitely one of the best films of 99 , and had some of the best acting , most notably by moore . 

not for all movie goers , but for those who are film buffs and want something of value .

"the last of vampire-films offers plenty of blood and gore , but beyond that - nothing . 

jack crow ( james woods ) is a professional vampire slayer that is secretly working for the vatican . 

his and his men's mission is to clean the earth from vampires . 

they have lost count of how many vampires they have slaughtered , but one has always escaped them . 

valek ( thomas ian griffith ) - the dark messias and ruler of the undead that is older than time itself . 

for all eternity the vampires have searched for their salvation - the black cross . 

with the cross in their possesion , the vampires will be able to walk in the sunlight . 

after that it is either the humans or the vampires who will dominate the earth . . . 

i have never liked john carpenter and his style . 

after seeing this film , my opinions have not changed . 

john carpenter remains john carpenter . 

however , because of the film's self-irony , black humour and fascinating cinematography , i would say that it is his greatest achievement in a long , long time . 

neither the synopses or carpenter's direction are original . 

but there are some things that are interesting . 

the director's negative view on the catholic church , for instance . 

at the end of the film it becomes clear that cardinal alba ( maximilian schell ) has simply used crow and his team to find valek , so that he would gain eternal life . 

otherwise the catholic priests are shown cool - drinking , smoking and breaking the rool of celibacy . 

carpenter has created an interesting atmosphere . 

set in new mexican dessert , he switches between bright golden sunrises and bloody sundowns , symbolically illustrating the good and the evil through light and darkness . 

more than anything in this film , this simple illustration shows the battle between good and evil . 

the cinematography by gary b . kibbe is probably the film's greatest achievement . 

music ( composed by john carpenter himself ) is at times effective , the special effects and makeup are likewise worth a notice . 

when it comes to the cast ( in an intellectual film like this casting is the last problem ; everyone can scream and swing the axe ! ) , but here james woods is suprisingly convincing . 

he is macho and cool as the dedicated hunter , who lost his family to the "" breed of evil "" . 

woods is constantly overacting , which really saves the film from falling into the trap of serious self importance . 

daniel baldwin is also entertaining as crow's loyal partner . 

the other cast members are struggling . 

because the film doesn't take itself too seriously , it stays afloat . 

still it is like most vampire-films - a mediocre experience . 
"
"adam sandler isn't known for appearing in deep , thought-provoking films , but he's still a really funny guy . 

most of his movies are successful not because of the film making behind them , but because they let sandler do what he does best without a stupid plot to drown him out . 

big daddy is the first film in which the story seems more important than sandler's comic performance , and it's a miserable failure . 

sandler plays a thirty-something loser who gets attached to an orphaned young boy ( played by cole and dylan sprouse ) . 

as one might expect from the synopsis , director dennis dugan resorts to the usual bag of manipulative and sentimental sequences , including a repulsive courtroom battle and a lot of teary scenes in which characters say "" good-bye "" to one another ; in addition , there's a ridiculous amount of disgusting toilet humor ( urine and vomit both get more screen time than sandler himself ) . 

there's a hilarious running joke featuring a female doctor who previously worked at hooters , and the film features passable performances from sandler , joey lauren adams ( as the love interest ) , and the two young boys , but the film on the whole is trite and disappointingly unfunny .

" * * * the following review contains spoilers * * * 

 "" it's just . . . 

the way . . . 

we are . "" 

--- a rapist ( matt frewer ) responds to supergirl's ( helen slater ) query as to why she's being attacked , an example of the mind-numbingly bad dialogue in supergirl . 

i'll admit it . . . 

i love superman iii . 

i know it's hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for richard pryor , but i still think it's a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise . 

supergirl , a spin-off film of sorts from the series' same producers ( alexander and ilya salkind ) , doesn't even rival superman iii in terms of quality , let alone superman or superman ii . 

supergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time . 

as the film begins we see the residents of argo city , a commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in "" inner space "" , go about their daily lives . 

ok . . . 

what ? 

so these are exiles from krypton , which blew up right ? 

were they living there before krypton exploded ? 

how do you get to "" inner space "" ? 

this whole "" inner space "" notion is never explained , particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world . 

how do they know where superman went ? 

how do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet ? 

these kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me . 

argo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron . 

one day the founder of argo city , zaltar ( peter o' toole ) , gives the omegahedron to superman's cousin , kara ( helen slater ) , for use as inspiration in her art . 

kara uses it to create a bug-like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of "" whatever "" that protects the city . 

in the chaos , the omegahedron sails out through the opening , dooming the argonians to death . . . 

in three days time , or something . 

kara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world . 

the power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minor-league witch named selena ( faye dunaway ) who , immediately before her dip was ruined , announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel ( peter cook ) . 

selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans , and she sets out to achieve world domination . 

selena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth , and that she's arrived as supergirl ( complete with appropriate costume ) . 

supergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives . 

ok . . . 

huh ? 

why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake ? 

attention movie : explain yourself ! 

i'm sorry , i can only suspend disbelief so much . 

i can't buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to . 

knowing that she needs a secret identity , supergirl basically "" wills "" herself into a school girl outfit ( complete with a different hairstyle ) , picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school . 

she's given her dorm assignment , and who happens to be her roommate ? 

lois lane's sister , lucy . 

ok , coincidence is one thing folks , but we're getting really contrived now . 

what follows are some generic all-girls school hijinks . . . 

complete with evil bully girls ( mean for no reason , of course ) and even a shower scene ( ! ) . 

best moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks . 

at this point i'm rapidly wondering why i'm bothering with this nonsense . 

there is some credit to give to the film however . 

one lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an "" evil "" bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its "" prey "" is very well done . 

also , its commendable to see genders reversed in the film , whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools . 

hart bochner ( die hard ) is particularly fun as kara's love interest , a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena ( although he is unfortunately part of one of the film's more ridiculous moments , when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some "" menacing "" bumper cars ) . 

then there were numerous little things that bothered me . 

the flying effects are never convincing for a moment . . . 

it's all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires . 

instead of having her look like she's flying , the filmmakers wanted her to be "" graceful "" , so she poses a lot and does ballet-type maneuvers . 

also , who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth ? 

a pair of truck drivers/rapists who immediately attack her and then meet a "" wacky "" demise . 

there is also some rampant product placement in the film , most notably for popeye's , tylenol , and a&w root beer , with the latter actually putting its logo on the t-shirt of one of the rapists ( ? ! ) . 

finally , just one word : monsters . 

faye dunaway and peter o'toole ham it up unmercifully , however when o'toole overacts he's entertaining and when dunaway does it she's annoying ( her character actually says the line "" seize them ! "" 

at one point ) . 

dunaway's henchmen ( played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro ) fare much better , with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty's otis character from the first two superman movies . 

helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent , naive character she's written to be , as she's able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable . 

believability aside though , it's still annoying . 

now despite all this negativity ( and i'm not alone here . . . supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles ) , leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested , but excited about its release on dvd ! 

they have released two separate editions of the film on dvd , to the delight of many people ( including myself . . . 

yet i'm still unclear as to why , since this movie is so awful ) . 

the first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u . s . theaters . 

the movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2 . 35 : 1 , is enhanced for 16x9 televisions , and has been remastered in full thx glory . 

extras on the disc include : a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and "" special project consultant "" scott michael bosco , the excellent 50-minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl-the making of a feature ( dig that workout montage ! ) , 5 trailers , 3 tv spots , talent bios , in-depth storyboards ( accompanied by score from the movie ) , and assorted still galleries . 

the transfer on this international version is incredible . . . 

you'd think you were watching a new release . 

images are sharp , colors jump off the screen , and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts . 

only some special effects sequences show the wear of time , and there just isn't much that can be done about that ( unless you're obsessive like george lucas ) . 

the new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places , however you'll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score ( which is completely unrelated to john williams' classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films' golan-globus production ) . 

the commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries . 

bosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there's no dead air on the track . 

bosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen , and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation . 

although , at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc , and is surprised when he doesn't get that response . 

we learn some fascinating tidbits on the track , most notably the "" almost "" appearance in the film by christopher reeve . 

great detail is given about superman's proposed role in the original script before reeve ( wisely ) dropped out . 

as it stands , superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission . 

for the sake of brevity , i won't even get into that one . 

szwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds ( and everyone else agreed ) that supergirl needed to stand on its own , replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy "" whimsical fantasy "" nonsense . 

bosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along , claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office . 

again , for the sake of brevity , i won't even get into that one . 

anchor bay has also released a limited edition ( only 50 , 000 copies pressed ) two-disc set . 

disc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release . 

disc two features the never before seen director's cut of the film , which runs 138 minutes long . 

the additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don't add much of note , except for a few moments which lengthen peter o'toole's screen time ( particularly during his latter appearances ) . 

the print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono , but fans of the film won't care . 

one question though . . . 

shouldn't the director's commentary be on the director's cut of the film ? 

i'd never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd . 

i was nine when it was released to theaters , and even then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it . 

so when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect . 

i knew the film wasn't beloved and i never had any interest in it before , but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc . 

as the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence , which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong . 

come to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo . . . 

so i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started . 

at the end of the film , supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron , and flies back to argo city . 

ugh , i give up . 

i'm surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once , not twice , but three times to review these discs . 

supergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package , but a very lousy movie .

"produced by robert lantos & stephen j . roth 

directed by douglas williams 

mpaa : not rated ( though from language , violence , medical-gross-outs , and sexual content , i'd put it at pg ) 

though made in canada , "" overdrawn at the memory bank "" traces its roots to the bbc school of film production . 

using , for the most part , cheap computer and video special effects , chyron text , wildlife documentary footage , and sets that are sometimes obviously faked up , it nonetheless manages to tell a good enough science fiction story that by the time you're twenty minutes into it , you should be hooked . 

raul julia plays aram fingal , a drone data processing worker for novicorp whose active imagination and predilection for hacking gets him into trouble with authority . 

caught watching "" casablanca "" on his desk monitor , fingal is sentenced to "" doppling "" rehabilitation--he is to spend forty-eight hours in the body of a baboon . 

 ( how exactly this is supposed to rehabilitate him is anybody's guess . ) 

as it happens , thanks to a visiting schoolboy's prank , his body is temporarily misplaced , and his mind has to be shunted into the central computer to keep him alive until they can find it . 

as time ticks away before his memory cube self-destructs , the frantic search for his body is on . . . while 

fingal first creates a virtual reality fantasy world , then finds there's no better way to hack the system than from the inside . 

during the chaos , computer technician apollonia james ( linda griffiths ) maintains contact with fingal through a datalink , manifesting several different times to offer advice or warnings . 

over the course of their interactions , interest on both their parts grows into a budding romance . 

given that "" casablanca "" is fingal's favorite film , and the basis for his fantasy world , a great deal of the movie is homage to "" casablanca "" . 

in fact , the humphrey bogart and peter lorre characters make appearances ( played by julia in a dual role and louis negin , respectively ) in a bar called "" the place "" . 

julia's portrayal of bogart is passable , and avoids becoming the "" schweethaat "" -spouting parody seen in cartoons . 

negin's peter lorre is quite credible , and easily the best peter lorre i've ever seen who wasn't the real thing . 

the two of them , as characters created by fingal's imagination , serve as aspects of his personality , driving him on in his quest to hack the computer system . 

those aren't the only casablanca characters to put in appearances . 

the sydney greenstreet character also happens to be around . . . as "" the fat man "" , the alternate aspect of the film's main villain , the novicorp chairman ( donald c . moore ) . 

while fingal's body is lost , the fat man tries to stop him from hacking the system . . . with 

less than salutory results . 

it's interesting to note the futuristic slang words that are thrown about left and right during the film , in the best golden-age science fiction tradition . 

words like "" dopple "" , "" psychist "" , "" computech "" , "" cinema "" , and "" reconst "" are apparently in common use . 

and while people of today may well laugh at fourteen years past's idea of futuristic data processing clerks , some aspects of this film are surprisingly perfectly in keeping with the way we think of "" virtual reality "" today . 

as cyberpunk films go , this may not be a staple of the genre , but it's definitely recommended viewing . 

the special effects are very primitive , placing this production in the realm of low-to-medium-budget television . 

the music is completely electronic-synthesized , which fits the low budget but isn't really out of keeping with the genre . 

however , the writing quite makes up for it . 

there are some very funny moments , and quite a few little in-jokes that one needs to have seen "" casablanca "" to appreciate properly . 

all in all , i give "" overdrawn at the memory bank "" a . 
"
"phew , what a mess ! 

for his fifth collaboration with director rich- ard donner ( lethal weapon i-iii , maverick ) , mel gibson plays a motormouth , maybe mentally ill new york city cabbie , jerry , whose wild conspiracy theories are all but ignored by alice ( julia roberts , acting all serious ) , the justice department employee that he has a crush on . 

she not interested , but another person is : a cia psychiatrist ( patrick stewart ) who promptly kidnaps him . 

is one of jerry's conjectures correct ? 

 * is * the metal strip in the new $100 bill being used to track your movements ? 

is oliver stone still alive , because he cut a deal with george bush to spread * dis * information ? 

is this movie really about * any * of the crazed cabbie's theories ? 

no , no , and no . 

as it turns out , there's some other nonsense going on here , involving and revolving around jerry's background . 

 ( hint : pay attention to an early scene where jerry blacks out and flashes back , in quick succession , to images of an interrogation room , hypodermic needles , and ms . roberts herself . ) 

the * initial * premise is pretty good and is played , for a while , at a delightfully dizzying clip . 

mel is wider-open that we've ever seen him and , if his character's relationship with roberts' initially strains credibility , their combined star power is blissfully intoxicating . 

 ( the highest wattage of the summer , perhaps ? ) 

even when the plot contrivances begin to intrude , the two remain a randy dandy screen pair . 

there's a great scene in jerry's fortress , er , apartment , with alice trying to act casual as her hyperactive host tries to remember the combination to a locked coffee bean container . 

 ( which he stores in another locked con- tainer , his fridge . ) 

other hilarious moments , of which there are many , include a trio of memorable convention-breakers , where alice ditches a tail , jerry cold-cocks someone , and , later , eludes a foot pursuit , each in a uproariously unexpected fashion . 

 ( that's donner's own ladyhawke playing in the theater , btw . ) 

let's see , other pleasures include . . . 

a brilliant title sequence , a jazzy score from carter burwell , and the worth-paying-to-see sight of roberts pumping lead into one bad guy and slamming another's head into a wall . 

oh , pretty woman ! 

getting to the latter , however , requires slogging through an increasingly overburdened and ultimately unappealing story . 

the last hour of conspiracy theory devolves from tolerable to torturous to almost unwatchable . 

more stuff happens of the stupid shit variety than is worth mentioning here , except , perhaps , for a late sequence that has alice locating jerry in an abandoned wing of a mental hospital by hearing his voice carrying through the air ducts . 

and here i thought it was wabbit season . 

good god , who rewrites these movies ? 

and do they arrive in nondescript black vehicles ? 
"
"tempe mills cinema , az--this movie had us in non-stop stitches from beginning to end . 

all those promotional clips that have been on tv for the past month came from the first five minutes of the movie . 

if you thought they were funny , see the rest of the movie . 

it's hilarious . 

how does one go about making a movie about a couple guys whose only claim to fame is synchronized head-bopping on snl to exactly one song ? 

easy . 

write an interesting script around tried-and-true ideas , add some good lines and satire , and voil ? , you end up with an excellent , well-done , very entertaining flick . 

will and chris are idiot brothers forced by their father to work begrudgingly in the family flower business during the day . 

at night they pursue their life-long ambition to loose their virginity in failed attempts to get into the roxbury in beverly hills , ca , the only disco act worth going to . 

the only problem , the place is so popular and the waiting line so long that by the time the brothers make it to the front door , the roxbury closes , all the while bearing witness to guys with one-hundred-dollar bills and movie stars like richard grieco who get past the doorman without fuss . 

the script authors ( steve koren , will ferrell and chris kattan ) cleverly devised a way for our boys to get into the roxbury . 

their flower-shop van is rear-ended by richard grieco , who fears a law-suit and is surprised to see the idiots are too star-struck to think about the car accident they just had , but not about getting into the roxbury . 

grieco happily takes them in , even introduces them to the owner , which has the added benefit of enhancing the financial appearance of the idiot brothers in the eyes of a couple of gold diggers ( elisa donovan and gigi rice ) who bet their time and bodies on will and chris . 

what follows are some of the best slap-stick dancing routines ever . 

the music is superb , and could have only been made better had the producers added patrick hernandez's born to be alive . 

the choreography at times was a parody of an era gone by , for example , the bee gees and their stayin' alive . 

it is nostalgic for those of us who remember that far back , and the technique is a clever adaptation that worked well in forest gump . 

one of the funniest scenes is when the gold diggers discover that will 

and chris don't have any mone y , and dump both on the spot , even expressing violence and anger that they gave sex away . 

an art-imitates-life poke at shallow women . 

it's a scene that's an approximate parody of the vinegar's own rolf luedeke's editorial this week national organization for men ( nom ) replaces now . 

ted "" unabomber "" 

kaczynski , himself rejected for not having money , will identify well with this scene , if he ever watches the movie . 

of course , the script wouldn't be complicated enough without adding molly shannon , the girl next door who has had a crush on will since they were kids , and who will has had an aversion to in quest of good-looking disco blondes ( proof that men will turn down perfectly good women when there are bay watch babes always lurking nearby ) . 

nevertheless , will's father wants him to marry molly anyway , but thinks idiot chris is standing in the way and sends him into guest-quarter exile . 

during the wedding ceremony , will's heart isn't exactly into getting married , and when his brother appears on the balcony with a ghetto blaster and more head-bopping music , will thinks worse of the knot-tieing idea and runs to chris . 

definitely an snl parody of the graduate where katharine ross changed her mind for the screaming dustin hoffman in the church balcony . 

i found this scene a riot , however , it went over brandi's head -- she was born seven years after the graduate first appeared . 

the scene has a good punch line when molly shannon marries , instead , the step-in buddy/weight-lifter ( who looks like he could pass for the son of gary busy ) and who has been lusting for a good-looker for a long time , but ready now to take anyone . 

more art-imitates-life stuff -- not even muscles can substitute for money in the real world . 

the idiots' mother is played by loni anderson , whose barbie-doll looks 

don't play well anymore ( she's a bit old ) , and whose cleavage looks like someone botched a tracheotomy too low down . 

i recommend this movie for anyone who wants to have a lot of fun or in 

need of a lot of laughs . 

go with a date . 

brandi laughed non-stop , as i 

did , and a deaf-mute might have concluded i was tickling her continuously for 105 minutes . 
"
"man , this was one wierd movie . 

similar to conspiracy theory in that it couldn't decide which genre it is . 

the first hour is your standard stock aliens clone , which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship . 

the last half hour ? 

this was when the makers blew the script out the airlock and just decided - "" screw it , let's just kill everybody "" . 

from then on - forget sci-fi . . . this 

movie becomes 100% horror . 

what really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried to scare you in entirely the wrong way . 

instead of using clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare - this movie just uses loud noises , sudden camera shifts and short quick bursts of gore . . . . . yawn . . . . everyone's 

seen it all before and knows when to expect it . 

the one thing that was done well was the lead up to finding out about what happened to the previous crew . 

there are skeletons lying around mangled and mashed , but what did this ? 

then finally after being painfully restored - the new crew views the video . 

the acting isn't too bad at all . . . . . considering what the actors had to work with anyway , as there is no complex or interesting dialogue to speak of . 

there was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences though , like when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached and the camera pans back to follow specific objects as they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into space . 

this movie could have been so much better . 

it had a good experienced cast who deserved more to work with . 

there was just nothing new here that any of us haven't seen before in aliens or hellraiser .

"the sequel to the fugitive ( 1993 ) , u . s marshals is an average thriller using it's association with the fugitive just so it can make a few extra bucks . 

tommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard , the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive . 

this time , he's after fugitive mark sheridan ( snipes ) who the police think killed two fbi agents , but of course he's been set up , and when the police plane escort he ( and gerard ) are riding crashes , he makes a run for it , gerard not so hot on his tail . 

what follows is about 2 hours of action , brought to us by the director of executive decision ( 1995 ) , another film curiously involving a plane . 

when comparing this movie to the fugitive , the prequel is far superior . 

but even on it's own , u . s marshals is a pretty lousy movie . 

while the original was reasonably intelligent , and had a fugitive to root for , the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive , mainly because we know so little about him until way into the film's overlong running time . 

while the fugitive gave a little time to develop harrison fords character , u . s marshals is straight in there , pulling it's trump card ( the place crash ) almost immediately . 

to be honest , i couldn't care less if snipe's character got captured or not . 

snipes performance is average , and his character gets surprisingly little screen time ( considering he is the fugitive ) for reasons i'll explain later . 

tommy lee jones is as fine as ever , although his role is hardly a challenge . 

the sense of deja vu was overwhelming . 

i know it's the same role from the fugitive , but there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film . 

there's a few 'nudge nudge' references from the first film , but apart from that , nothing . 

nobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie . 

downey jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce who's roped into the chase , and sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in and out of the movie as snipes wife . 

nobody looks as if their having a good time , and all the performers are on autopilot . 

the supporting cast are o . k , but when it comes to performances , u . s marshals falls flat on it's face . 

it doesn't fare any better plot-wise , either . 

the film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes , but then veers off into terrorists territory . 

as said above , the film is an normal , average terrorist thriller , seen a million times before , but is using the fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional . 

if this film wasn't the 'sequel' to the fugitive , this would probably go straight to video , or not even been made at all , because it's so average . 

and because of the film's plot changing it's course , snipes is almost forgotten apart , and hardly features in the movie . 

stuart baird , the director , is all right , but there's no particular scene that stands out . 

it's director is the usual action movie style . 

even the plane crash is sorely lacking in tension . 

the special effects are nice , especially the plane crash , and there's a good ( if very loud ) soundtrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith . 

but in the end , u . s marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of excitement . 

sure , it's loud and dumb , but in the end u . s marshals just ain't fun . 

bored performers and a lackluster plot and script , do not make a good action movie .

"topless women talk about their lives falls into that category that i mentioned in the devil's advocate : movies that have a brilliant beginning but don't know how to end . 

it begins by introducing us to a selection of characters who all know each other . 

there is liz , who oversleeps and so is running late for her appointment , prue who is getting married , geoff , liz's boyfriend , neil , her previous boyfriend , ant who has written a screenplay . 

for the first hour , we get to know these people through everyday activities , as they talk on the phone , go out to dinner , hang clothes on the line . 

the interactions seem so truthful and guileless that it is almost as if the film-makers hid cameras around the place and filmed these people unbeknownst to them . 

at times , the events border on the ridiculous , like the screening of the film , but they still seem in keeping with the characters and their lives . 

this doesn't sound like a brilliant premise for a film - "" we just follow a lot of people around who are vaguely related "" - but it's the execution of the idea that makes topless women talk about their lives so engrossing . 

unfortunately this level of honesty isn't maintained . 

with about half an hour to go , a sense of impending doom invades topless women talk about their lives and from there is descends into melodrama . 

such a disappointment after such a brilliant start . 

the actors are all quite good with ms . danielle cormack as liz being particularly impressive . 

the energy of her character is palpable and is a major reason the movie is so watchable . 

a lot of the performances are a bit rough around the edges but this suits totally the documentary feel of the film . 

it seems like these are real people we are watching rather than actors playing roles . 

that is why the melodramatic turn of events comes as such a shock . 

up till that point , i was transported to this world where these real but mildly insane events were taking place . 

while the final half hour is not beyond the realms of possibility , it's unlikely in a way that is jarring to someone caught up in the world of the film . 

not just the events , but also the tone of some of the end is wrong , clashing strongly with the sense of fun that has preceded it . 

this is not to say that topless women talk about their lives is not a good film . 

as stated above , the first hour is superb and even the end is above average . 

it just takes a turn which means that an otherwise brilliant movie loses some of its gloss . 
"
"this is the worst movie i've seen since the "" so bad i walked out on it "" "" jingle all the way "" . 

it is crap on toast made of crap baked in a an oven fueled by crap . 

it is crap through and through . 

nothing works in this film , as to be expected from joel schumacher , who has made only one watchable film in his entire career ( that being "" cousins "" ) . 

here's a man who admits he's a medicore director , a rather charmingly self-effacing statement . 

but truth be told , he is much worse than mediocre . 

not all scorn should be heaped on schumacher though -- akiva goldsman should not be allowed to write ever again . 

there is no plot anywhere , and the "" dialogue "" is unrelentingly shallow , preposterous , and boring . 

they set up mr . freeze as a tragic figure trying to cure his cryogenically frozen wife , then completely sabotage his character by giving him the lamest one-liners . 

it turns him into a stock maniacal villain who thoroughly enjoys his villainy instead of a brooding scientist who has spent much of his life to bringing his wife from the brink of death . 

but that's par for course -- nothing in this film makes any sense , including half of arnold schwarzenegger's lines . 

as mr . freeze , arnold is given way too much dialogue to spit out at once . 

this is the same problem he had in "" jingle all the way "" , and it seems that his austrian accent is getting thicker and more unintelligible as the days pass . 

personally , i think that he has more pull with the directors and doesn't retake scenes to make him understandable . 

compare his dialogue in the terminator series to the load of nonsense that streams forth in "" batman & robin "" . 

apparently , james cameron knows how to get a competent performance out of arnold . 

uma thurman is not as bad , but nothing resembling good either . 

her poison ivy vamps around terribly , chewing up scenery left and right . 

and her pamela isley scenes are marred by sub-snl standard "" acting "" , as if she's reading off cue cards and is about to laugh at any given moment . 

given the "" script "" , it's a wonder it didn't happen more frequently . 

there is no redeeming feature in this film -- not george clooney as batman , chris o'donnell as robin , nor alicia silverstone as batgirl . 

michael gough is eerily sickly looking as alfred , as if the conceit of his illness was prompted by his cadaverous appearance . 

in fact , there was something unsettling about his appearance , which seems to have been accomplished without any make-up tricks , looking as if it were scenes from a documentary about a dying man . 

unfortunately , every scene about alfred's sickness is bungled with such incompetence that there is absolutely no emotional resonance -- they just go through the motions , losing whatever impact the scenes were supposed to impart . 

the movie is rife with poorly choreographed fights scenes that never give any sense of a big battle -- you know there's a bunch of people , but instead of a melee , schumacher decided to focus on a foot or a fist . 

there's never a moment of awe , wonder , or mayhem . 

the only interesting part of the battles scenes are the freezing effects , which are impressive ( and probably expensive ) . 

even then , the fights are so full of camp and stupidity that they become unwatchable . 

the hockey team from hell ? 

not even the tv series got that stupid ( at least not on the grand scale of stupidity that "" batman & robin "" showcases ) . 

frustrating too are the various supporting characters that walk on and off with nothing to say or do . 

blink , and you'll miss elle macpherson as julie madison , vivica fox as a "" why is she even in the film "" vamp in freeze's lair ( with all of two lines ) , and pat hingle as the most ineffectual commissioner gordan the batman series ever had . 

and in what almost seems like an effort to save on costs , vendela kirsebom has no lines as mrs . fries -- she isn't even filmed well enough to look good ( trust me , she's quite attractive outside of this dreck ) . 

and as if the film weren't bad enough to limp along with bad direction , bad dialogue , bad performances , and bad fight scenes , there are inconsistencies and illogic galore . 

i know it's nit-picky to ask where the hundreds of feet of cable are stored in the batarangs , why the character's arms aren't ripped out of their sockets when they accomplish a one-armed batarang save after falling hundreds of feet ( while holding on to another person no less ) , or where the moisture comes from when freeze's weapon creates tons if ice . 

that's all traditional comic book stuff . 

but why does batman spring a trap for freeze at a public charity event that endanger the lives of hundreds of by-standers ? 

why is there a big switch clearly marked , "" heat "" in mr . freeze's lair ? 

why do countless bumbling police officers even try to take on mr . freeze hand to hand ? 

why does alfred encourage silverstone to become batgirl and even go so far as to have a suit made for her ? 

why do batman & robin take 10 minutes to bicker before leaving the batcave in response to an emergency ? 

and since it established early on that ivy is using pheromones , why don't they wear masks to filter it out ? 

i could go on and on . 

 "" batman & robin "" is a braindead , pointless , garish , loud film that should still reign as the "" worst film of the year "" by the time 1998 rolls along . 

note to warner bros . -- if you're going to make another batman film , please replace schumacher with nearly anyone . 

because it could actually get worse than this . 

what schumacher does not understand is that "" comic book "" doesn't automatically equal unbearable idiocy . 

the true equation seems to be schumacher + batman = unbearable idiocy .

"i'm currently accepting all future names for drew barrymore characters . 

in _the wedding singer_ , she was julia gulia . 

in _never been kissed_ , she's josie grossie . 

future db character names include : janet granite , janey grainy , and for that nc-17 project in the works , jo-jo . . . 

aw forget it . 

i'll stick to my day job . 

this is a teen movie , all right , except the main characters aren't teens . 

drew barrymore is a copy editor at the chicago sun times who gets her big break as a reporter , only it's very clear from the onset that she lacks the toughness and the pushy extravertedness that marks the best of reporters . 

the story she's covering is not really a story , but a story in the making . 

she is to return to high school as a student and explain what's really going on . 

the irony is that drew's character , was such a dweeb first time around , that she is terrified at going back . 

when she does , she says the wrong things , wears the wrong clothes , and projects the "" i know the answer "" in class that popular kids ( or at least popular kids in the movies ) reject . 

at least she befriends nerdy aldys ( joan of arc's leelee sobieski--watch for her ) , who turns out to be more beautiful than those who are "" supposed "" to be more beautiful than her . 

what works : drew's geeky old-self . 

after a start in films that was headline driven , and a nadir of roles that had her play the sluttish character , it's a surprise to see her with bad hair , big glasses and braces . 

it's very funny . 

what doesn't work : drew's geeky new-self . 

come on . 

nobody dresses as bad as she does . 

couldn't she just go to _the gap_ and take suggestions ? 

had she dressed like princess leia it would have been better . 

the comedy is supposed to progress when drew's younger brother ( played with zest by david arquette ) reenlists to jump-start his baseball career . 

now , how in the world can somebody as nerdy ( but in a funny way ) as he can be the most popular kid in the school . . . 

in a day ? ! 

the dialogue in the film is , well , an embarrassment . 

her co-workers ( molly shannon , john c . reilly and gary marshall ) are in terminal hyper-drive . 

her teenage peers ( except sobieski ) are so inept and stupid that there's little bite from them . 

couldn't the filmmakers watch _heathers_ first ? 

lastly , i am proud to say that i caught a significant gaffe in the film . 

if you see the film , you'd know what i'm talking about : 

drew walks into a bar , has her hand stamped , and over the night associates with some rastafarians with some delicious , um , cake . 

she goes wild , sleeps in late . 

when she wakes , she rushes off to school , without showering , without noticing that her head , lying on her stamped hand all night , has transferred part of the stamp's image to her forehead , spelling "" loser "" . 

funny , eh ? 

 . . . except that the hand would have transferred that image backwords .

"the rapid-fire formula that worked so well in airplane ! , the "" police squad ! "" 

television series , top secret ! , three naked gun films , and two hot shots ! 

movies has finally reached a desperate dead-end with spy hard . 

even ezio gregio's the silence of the hams is arguably funnier than this over-extended spy- and action-movie spoof . 

leslie nielsen stars as secret agent wd-40 , who returns from retirement to battle his old nemesis , general rancor ( a cackling andy griffith ) . 

the jokes fly in every direction and with hardly a hint of restraint , timing , or tact . 

most the movie is comprised of recycled airplane and naked gun gags , recreated movie sequences , and soggy star cameos . 

yeah , maybe we * do * need ray charles driving an l . a . bus bound for a speed bump , but did mr . t , hulk hogan , and dr . joyce brothers also have to appear in the same movie ? 

leslie nielsen plays it straight with his usual dopey flair . 

there is something oddly inspiring about the sight of nielsen wearing a nun's habit , even the resulting sister act spoof is silly . 

as are the bits directly lifted from home alone , pulp fiction , true lies , etc . etc . ( adolescent males might enjoy this mess , tho . 

the butt shots , breast peeks , penis pokes , flatulence gags , and related innuendo are right up beavis and butthead's alley . ) 

beyond the hilarious title sequence with "" weird "" al yankovich performing the theme song , spy hard is barely the stock that it's printed on . 

my recommendation : duck in while you're waiting for another movie to start . 

stay long enough to see the camera dart inside of weird al's nostril and then leave . 

you won't miss a thing .

"susan granger's review of "" legally blonde "" ( m . g . m . ) 

it's a "" pretty in pink "" / "" clueless "" coming-of-age story for the new millennium as elle woods ( reese witherspoon ) , a perky southern california sorority queen , switches from fashion to law in order to win back her yuppy boyfriend ( matthew davis ) . 

the girl-power story begins as this sweetheart of delta nu is unceremoniously dumped by a bonehead who says : "" if i'm going to be a senator by the time i'm 30 . . . i 

need to marry a jackie , not a marilyn . "" 

determined to prove she's as smart a snobby brunette ( selma blair ) from country-club connecticut , elle not only applies to harvard law school but gets in , much to the amazement of family , friends and faculty . 

once there , this flaxen-haired fish-out-of-water not only survives but tenaciously thrives , befriending a local manicurist ( jennifer coolidge ) , dazzling a professor ( victor garber ) and rescuing a defendant ( ali larter ) in a celebrated boston murder trial , plus finding a more worthy beau ( luke wilson ) . 

in the tradition of teen-comedy film-maker john hughes and his disciple amy heckerling , there's wit , cheerfulness , a fidelity of observation and a penchant for problem-solving . 

first-time feature director robert luketic is blessed with reese witherspoon who's joyously incandescent in this utterly formulaic light comedy written by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith , based on a soon-to-be-published novel by amanda brown . 

the supporting cast is terrific , particularly raquel welch and holland taylor - and i particularly got a kick out of the gag of elle distributing scented resumes in pink , her signature color on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" legally blonde "" is a frivolous , funny , feel-good 8 . 

filled with ditzy blonde ambition , it's a movie for high-school kids that their parents would be happy to have them see .

"the happy bastard's quick movie review 

holy man 

more like holy crap . 

the film stars eddie murphy as a mystical-ish figure named g on a strange journey of some sort when he comes across two network execs ( jeff goldblum and kelly preston ) with a flat tire on their hands . 

somehow he ends up in their car and on their channel , a line-up of infomercial programs featuring the likes of betty white , morgan fairchild , and a slew of other celebrities and nameless figures . 

it's here that he seems to hit his stride , speaking of life instead and somehow boosting sales . 

at this point in the movie , of course , morality comes into play , particularly on goldblum , who suddenly feels he can market the magical g into megabucks to get in good with his boss ( robert loggia ) . 

it doesn't take long for the movie to unfold into sappy mush , with realizations taking place left and right and poor plot points . 

only a real zippy sequence involving frying morgan fairchild's face seems to have any interest in the movie . 

murphy lends nothing to his character and poor goldblum looks as if he'd rather be someplace else . 

some may argue that the movie has a message , but all that came across to me is that i could probably get more entertainment watching that informercial with the guy in the question mark coat . 

at least he has something for us to laught at . . .

"you don't need to have seen the original "" species "" to appreciate how utterly lousy "" species ii "" is . 

with few exceptions , sequels tend to be worse than the films that spawned them , but the fact that "" species ii "" is a follow-up isn't the only reason it's so miserable . 

it's the predictable storyline , the cardboard characters , the banal dialogue , the failed attempts at humor , the revolting special effects , the gratuitous nudity ( all female , of course ) , the bad acting , and the bland direction . 

the plot , simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc , involves three astronauts landing on mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in a soil sample back aboard their shuttle . 

the slime , well , sort of jumps out at them and the screen turns black . 

that should have been the end of the movie right there . 

back on terra firma , at least one of the crew is now a carrier of alien dna and , as you'll remember if you saw the first movie , driven by a strong urge to procreate . 

on a parallel track , government scientists have cloned a version of sil from the first film ( now called eve , again "" played "" by natasha henstridge ) and are keeping her around for some testing . 

this , apparently , includes observing eve's reaction to "" the dukes of hazzard "" tv show , which she appears to enjoy . 

eve's bio-rhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk "" mates , "" which we are forced to witness in gross-out detail , but otherwise there doesn't appear to be a whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film , unless it was written into her contract ( let's hope it cited one sequel and one sequel only ) . 

eve finally breaks free of her confines--and her bra--for the finale , but the effects are so messy you can't really see what's going on . 

peter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams "" i told 'em not to go ! "" 

at the top of his lungs , referring to the mars mission but more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle . 

michael madsen reprises his role of press lennox ( so that he can enter high security areas , flash a badge and claim to be press , maybe ? ) , as does marg helgenberger as dr . laura baker , the one subjecting eve to the tv reruns . 

they're both unbelievably wooden . 

what's a talented filmmaker like peter medak ( "" the ruling class , "" "" the krays , "" "" let him have it "" ) doing directing this tripe , i wonder . 

it's an unfortunate trend , this : once-talented directors throwing in the towel and lending their names to unchallenging horror flicks like "" species ii . "" 

last year peter hyams gave us "" the relic "" ; no thanks necessary there . 

and the first "" species "" was helmed by roger donaldson who , although certainly no genius behind the camera , had demonstrated much better judgment with his previous choice of projects . 

is it just that there are no better offers out there ? 

 "" species ii "" is worthless . 

worse than that , it's also exploitative , offensive , and insulting to the intelligence at every turn . 

it's not that there isn't anything positive to say about the film . 

there is . 

after 92 minutes , it ends .

"director luis mandoki's last film was the superb , serious 1994 drama "" when a man loves a woman , "" but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture , "" message in a bottle , "" which is the worst type of romance , a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up . 

everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times before---and much better---so there's an absence of suspense , and the film ultimately moves at such a very , very deliberate pace , as if it is trying to make great , "" meaningful "" statements and plot developments , that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through . 

 "" message in a bottle "" begins with theresa osborne ( robin wright penn ) , a single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune , whom finds a bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day . 

inside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named catherine , and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and , to her objection , finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper . 

soon , a heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship logo on the top of the typed message , and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake , theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks , a boating town in north carolina , to find out the specifics of the message . 

of course , garrett turns out to be a handsome , rugged man around theresa's age and played by kevin costner . 

she is immediately charmed by him , but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there , and finds that catherine was garrett's late wife who died a few years earlier . 

do you think you know where this is headed ? 

most likely you do , and i wouldn't call it giving away anything to say that by the picture's end , the movie has fallen into deep , artificial melodrama that i didn't buy for a second . 

if there are any positive things to say about "" message in a bottle , "" it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman , as garrett's stubborn , but loving father , are far above par to be in such a wasteful , "" shaggy dog "" love story , and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast , and paints chicago as an equally alluring city . 

meanwhile , costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the less-than-stellar films that he has made recently . 

it seems that with such bad luck , he wouldn't want to make another movie set near water , but here he is again with one of the main , and most ridiculous , centerpieces set on a storm-swept sea . 

the other actors are all , sadly , wasted , including illeana douglas , an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the "" friend "" roles , here playing penn's confidante and co-worker at the tribune . 

the first half of "" message in a bottle "" plays like a hum-drum , trite television movie for the lifetime channel , as theresa spends a great deal of time "" getting to know "" garrett , with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining . 

usually , i am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogue-laden sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships , but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt "" written , "" and not as if people were really "" talking . "" 

when the main characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other , and are not particularly interesting themselves , you know immediately that you are in trouble . 

i swear that while watching "" message in a bottle , "" i felt as if i had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater ( heck , in actuality i'm not even familiar to the novel this is based on , by nicholas sparks ) . 

always one step ahead of the characters , the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the tried-and-true hollywood melodrama , the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing . 

nobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresa's secret , and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after . 

this same exact problem occurred in last year's very , very similar ( watch this , and you will realize just how similar i mean ) meg ryan-nicolas cage romantic drama , "" city of angels . "" 

although theresa is deeply touched by the "" heartfelt "" letter that she finds in the bottle , perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding a message in a bottle of their own , preferably before filming began . 

it should have read , "" memo to screenwriters : use you brain ! ""

"the art of woo attempts to be one of those films like breakfast at tiffany's in which the audience is rooting for some sweet , vulnerable , irresistible woman to work out her problems and to find happiness . 

the problem is that helen lee who writes and directs seems to have written alessa woo ( played by sook-yin lee ) as neither sweet nor vulnerable and she is quite resistible . 

alessa is a young woman who happens to be a brilliant art dealer in the toronto art scene . 

this is some sort of alternate world art scene where people pay tens of thousands of dollars for paintings by talented beginners and dealers in these paintings fly back and forth to places like switzerland . 

one of the most knowledgeable of the art dealers is alessa . 

she also happens to be the center of adulation of her friends and every party has suitors camped outside her window . 

next door to alessa moves struggling genius artist and native american ben crowchild ( adam beach ) . 

he sees that behind the facade that there is really a sad little girl within alessa who really will not be happy with the rich art collector she is dating . 

ben gets emotionally involved with alessa . 

 ( as alessa so delicately puts it , "" we were bosom buddies , now we're fuck buddies . "" ) 

but alessa will have to decide whether she wants love with ben or wealth with her rich suitor . 

the real problem with the film seems to be helen lee's inability to decide what she wants to be saying . 

she undercuts nearly everything she wants us to believe about alessa . 

alessa is looking for financial security but she makes decisions about large sums of money for her clients . 

this appears to be a high profile and well-paid job . 

we are supposed to care about alessa's feelings , but she coldly refuses to visit her own ailing father . 

alessa cannot be portrayed as sweet and vulnerable if at an art auction she turns into our man flint . 

this is a charmless romantic comedy that bets everything it has on the appeal of its main character and comes up double-zero . 

i rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a -1 on the -4 to +4 scale .

"wonderland is a rather sugary romance film that is as subtle as a ton of bricks falling on you . 

you can see its plot developing from a mile away . you 

are lured into its benign story of a single 29-year-old girl looking for a soul mate in boston , as that city is depicted as a mini-wonderland for singles . 

this is a star oriented film , and the star who carries the film is erin ( hope davis ) . 

that this is a dating film , about singles who for reasons of fate or luck , or whatnot , have not had a successful match and are now putting most of their energy into fulfilling their careers , is nothing new , this type of film has been done often and better many times in contemporary films . 

the fictionalized documentary unmade beds did it more provocatively and with more of a sense of urgency than this film . the 

main quirk in the plot here , is that hope's pushy mother ( hollan ) visits her in boston , sees her daughter's live-in relationship with a radical protester ( hoffman ) breakup and decides to put a personal ad in the newspaper for her harvard medical school drop-out daughter , who works as a nurse . 

this is done without her knowledge . 

it is cornball sitcom stuff , but , at least , it is handled as best it could be by the actors and director . 

it is easy to like erin , she is bright , caring , and attractively blonde . 

it is equally easy to care for the soul mate she keeps missing contact with , the financially strapped , ruggedly handsome , intelligent 35-year-old alan ( alan ) , who no longer wants to work with his father as a plumber but is doing volunteer work at the aquarium and attending college to be a marine biologist . 

of course , he comes across as being so good ( though , he does kill some fish in the aquarium ) , that it is hard to believe he's for real , or just some cardboard shining knight put into the story to give it an ideal to shoot for . 

the contrived story revolves around their near misses in meeting each other in such spots as , the subway , at a restaurant , or on the phone . 

alan's brother answers erin's ad with a few of his pals , as they each try to respond to her ad in a phony way , making a bet that the first who gets to tongue kiss her , that the others witness , will win the bet . 

this sub-plot was as obnoxious to see take place as it is to hear told . 

that we have to see erin go through several dates to prove the point how ego sick these guys are , each one more annoying than the other , culminating in the most obnoxious one of all , that brazilian lover ( jose ) , who is about as charming as a snake-oil salesman , who is actually the one she nearly flies away with for a holiday in brazil , was not only incredulous but downright contrary to the rich presentation of her character that was the heart of the story . 

anyway , as expected , all's well that ends well , for this watchable piece of fluff , that comes over on screen better than it does when relating its story-line . 

the dialogue was actually not bad , those dating erin or trying to flirt with her seemed to be uttering authentic things they would actually say in their situation . 

and , oh , by the way , wonderland refers to the stop on the boston metro , it is where greyhound racing takes place . 
"
"numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci-fi , suspense thrillers . 

soldier is a multi ? crossbreed between the likes of terminator , aliens and offspring . 

the problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is a real mongrel ? not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground . 

besides this , the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age . 

the fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured , slow and sluggish , and could have done with better choreography . 

russell who is usually a good actor in b-grade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character ? sergeant todd , who seems more like a sergeant toad . 

besides having almost no dialogue , his character appears stunted , zombie-like which is in line with his screen persona , but scores little points of empathy with the audience . 

this movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson , whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth . 

although this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former , it is still a long way from anything considered desirable .

" "" the 13th warrior "" comes at the end of as summer where we've already experienced man eating sharks ( "" deep blue sea "" ) , man eating crocodiles ( "" lake placid "" ) and even a man hunting witch ( "" the blair witch project "" ) . 

now , "" the 13th warrior "" presents a tribe of flesh eating men who believe that they are bears . 

the story , if that's what you want to call it , follows ahmed ibn fahdlan ( antonio banderas ) an arabian poet who falls in love with his king's wife and is banished from his home land . 

he then travels to the land of the vikings and becomes an ambassador to them . 

eventually the vikings are called upon to protect the people of the village who are being hunted by the flesh eating men . 

thirteen warriors are chosen to go on the mission , and as you guessed it , ahmed is chosen as the thirteenth . 

he's not a warrior , and at first not well accepted by the vikings , but as the movie advances he'll have to prove himself both on and off the battlefield . 

that's basically the entire plot . 

there is also a romantic subplot that has been so badly mishandled and , one assumes , drastically cut that you begin to wonder why the filmmakers didn't just edit out all of the scenes attaining to that part of the story . 

instead they chose to leave just enough of those scenes in to annoy the viewer . 

the film is basically non- stop action and when it pauses and tries to develop a story it becomes a laughing stock . 

the battle scenes , although well choreographed , are not involving and not the least bit exciting . 

we don't get to know any of the characters and so we don't care who lives and who dies . 

the film , which wants to be beowolf , comes across more as a failed action-adventure story aspiring to epic proportions but not achieving it on any levels . 

it was directed by john mctiernan who's , "" the thomas crown affair "" is also playing in theaters currently . 

and it's not that mctiernan worked simultaneously on both films but that , "" the 13th warrior "" was placed on the shelf for so long with the studio just waiting for a time to dump it on audiences . 

it belongs back on the shelf .

"first , i am not a big fan of the x-files tv series . 

i have nothing against it particularly , i just don't happen to watch it . 

having said that , i can now say that i liked the x-files pretty well . 

for us non-fans , there's nothing big going for it , but there are a lot of little things . 

the movie opens on an ice cave in north texas in 35 , 000 b . c . 

two proto-humans enter the cave and find a space alien cocooned inside . 

the alien breaks free and kills one man in a struggle while the other is seemingly captured by the bloody ooze from the alien . 

the movie jumps to the same cave today where a boy ( lucas black , from sling blade ) is captured by the same black ooze . 

we then cut to fbi agents scully and mulder ( gillian anderson and david duchovny ) , who have been pulled off of their previous assignment ( investigations into the paranormal ) and put onto the bomb squad detail . 

a caller has threatened a federal building in dallas , texas . 

on a hunch , mulder checks out the building across the street , and , wouldn't you know it , he turns out to be right . 

the fbi finds the bomb in time to evacuate but not in time to defuse . 

five people die in the blast , and when mulder learns who the victims were , a light bulb goes on over his head . 

the two agents team up to investigate , against fbi orders , the links mulder has made . 

their search leads them back to the north texas cave , all across the country , and even to antarctica as they get closer and closer to "" the truth . "" 

the plot , and "" the truth , "" are uninspired . 

i got the feeling that what i learned was supposed to shock and amaze me . 

it didn't . 

the possible existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them . 

but the point of the x-files is not what the truth is , but the extent to which it has been hidden . 

it's a slightly more interesting angle , but it still raises expectations about that "" truth "" too high . 

if this were the whole film , i would say the movie was mediocre , perhaps even boring . 

but there are other qualities that make me like this movie well enough to recommend it . 

the pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest . 

before the audience can get tired of one location , the agents follow a hot tip to another location , and so on and so forth . 

the locations are not all computer-generated sets , either . 

there are some artificial settings , but the desert night of nevada , the edge of suburbia in texas , and the endless fields of snow in antarctica ( actually somewhere in north america . ) 

make this fantastic film feel more real . 

ward russell's cinematography is very good . 

the overall look is dark and ominous , appropriate to the intended tone of the film's plot . 

russell is able to make something as innocuous as a cornfield look foreboding . 

when the movie is set in darkness , the picture quality is still rich and detailed . 

finally , and specifically , there is an incredible shot at night in which the camera crosses the tracks in front of a fast oncoming train . 

i don't know if the shot is faked in any way , but it looks dangerous , and it looks great . 

the movie's soundtrack is also used to convey the dark tone of the film . ( skip 

to the next paragraph if you have yet to see the movie - there is a spoiler in the following sentences . ) during the opening prehistoric sequence , a howling wind dogs the soundtrack , never giving the characters or the audience an escape from the lonely terrible sound . 

in one of the movie's most effective sequences , metallic doors suddenly slam open to release a cloud of buzzing bees . 

the visuals of the scene are good , but what makes it so surprising and frightening is the sound . 

there was no question as to who the movie's stars would be . 

even so , duchovny and anderson are an interesting pair of actors and a good combination . 

both are easy on the eyes and together , they have some good timing , banter , and energy . 

there is a hint of chemistry between them , but it never gets in the way of their professional relationship . 

they are like a couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street . 

there might be some romantic interest , but for now they're more interested in their environs than they are in each other . 

no single element really makes this movie outstanding - not even the sense of paranoia that makes the tv show so popular . 

but enough things were done right that the x-files is one of the more interesting summer adventures to come along .

"jay and silent bob strike back , kevin smith's swan song to his two most famous characters , is the best received comedy that i've seen since there's something about mary , which is a tea party in comparison to the foul-mouthed humor in jay and silent bob strike back . 

the audience didn't just laugh ; they went wild with boisterous laughter and heavy applause throughout . 

in short , if you like really raunchy humor , you may find it , as i did , to be the funniest movie of the year . 

 ( on the other hand , if you are one of those who walked out in disgust with smith's dogma , then jay and silent bob strike back is not the movie for you . ) 

in one of the fastest paced movies of the year , the story has jay and silent bob ( jason mewes and kevin smith ) , a pair of card carrying drug dealers , traveling from their new jersey convenience store home to hollywood so that they can stop a movie . 

it seems their comic book alter egos , bluntman and chronic , are being used in a movie without jay and silent bob's consent . 

jason biggs and james van der beek are slated to star in it . 

jay and silent bob strike back has more and better used cameos than just about any movie that i've ever seen . 

among others , they include carrie fisher as a bible-toting nun , mark hamill as a comic book version of his famous alter ego and gus van sant as a director too busy counting his money to yell , "" action ! "" 

best of all are ben affleck and matt damon who mock themselves and their movies . 

the film stops several times to make fun of itself and of the audience who was "" stupid "" enough to buy tickets to this movie . 

 ( actually , purchasing tickets to this film is extremely smart given that it delivers more laughter per dollar than anything in recent memory . ) 

the film even skewers people who write about movies on the internet . 

guilty . 

although it's filled with inside jokes , you'll still be laughing even if you only get some of them . 

it's easy to understand enough so that they are still funny . 

jay is a motor mouth who hasn't met a subject that he couldn't vulgarize . 

his favorite topic is oral sex , but , being an equal opportunity profaner , he's willing to make crude jokes about absolutely anything . 

but it is his buddy , the aptly named silent bob , who is responsible for most of the movie's success . 

his reaction shots , with his wildly exaggerated eye movements , are comedic gems . 

the story's main subplot concerns four animal rights activists , justice ( shannon elizabeth ) and her three sexy buddies , sissy ( eliza dushku ) , missy ( jennifer schwalbach smith ) and chrissy ( ali larter ) . 

these charlie's angels types give a ride to our heroes on their trek to lalaland to stop the picture . 

jay tries to put the moves on justice , but he doesn't stay in command of the situation for long . 

one of the funnier sight gags has the women using a pink , clam-shaped , birth control case that contains high tech gadgetry . 

granted , it's not the movie for everyone , but , if you like kevin smith's brand of humor , you'll find that this is his best . 

and , as i said earlier , it's the funniest movie of the year thus far . 

no , wait . 

forget , `thus far . ' 

it's bound to be the funniest movie of the year . 

in a time when almost every movie feels obligated to come in at pg-13 so that they can rake in the maximum cash , it's great to see a filmmaker with the guts to target only a mature audience . 

jay and silent bob strike back runs a lightening fast 1 : 35 . 

it is rated r and contains pervasive crude humor and language and sexual situations . 

it would be acceptable for high school seniors and older . 

the film opens nationwide in the united states on wednesday , august 22 , 2001 . 

in the silicon valley , it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters . 
"
"scream 2 , like its predecessor , is a genre-crossing film . 

it is about 50% horror film and 50% murder mystery . 

the mix worked very well last time and it continues to entertain this time . 

scream was also known for its self-referential tone . 

many inside jokes were made in reference to horror movies and wes craven . 

again , scream 2 follows suit with characters saying such things as "" sequels suck "" and "" the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels . "" 

scream 2's story is very similar to it's predecessor's . 

sidney ( neve campbell ) , having survived the killing spree in scream , is now in college . 

gale weathers ( courteney cox ) has written a book about the murders and that book is now being released as a feature film , called stab ( which for all practical purposes is the real-world movie scream ) . 

at the premiere of stab , two students from sidney's college are stabbed to death , and a new story begins . 

the press descends on sidney and her college to get the scoop on this sequel killer . 

they want to know all about the links between stab , sidney , and the recent murders . 

the most complex self-reference i saw ( this should be an olympic event ) was the scene where gale weathers was asking questions at a press conference . 

the rest of the press was watching and videotaping weathers . 

the other survivors from scream were watching and videotaping the press . 

the audience was watching the whole , filmed scene . 

 ( whew . ) 

the movie is packed with layers and self-references that make it a pleasure to watch . 

even better would be to watch a double feature of scream and scream 2 . that's not to say that these references necessarily make scream 2 a deep , or even a good movie . 

the just add to the fun of watching it . 

i recommend it for other reasons as well . 

what i liked best about the horror aspect of the movie is that the monster is not supernatural . 

no werewolf or ghost or psycho with superhuman strength is responsible . 

it is a person in a mask and a robe , his only advantage the fear he strikes into his victims . 

no extraordinary leap of faith is needed to believe in the killer . 

the down side is that if you are frightened by horror movies , you have less grounds to say "" it's just a movie . "" 

the whodunit aspect of the movie is not that great by itself - gale weathers and deputy dewey ( david arquette , also from the original ) track down a killer . 

they are likeable , but not outstanding . 

but in combination with the horror aspect , the whodunit is a perfect counterpoint . 

it was exactly a year ago today that i wrote the review for scream . 

the internet movie database says that scream 3 is in the works , so i wonder if i'll be doing the same thing on january 1 , 1999 . 

if craven and screenwriter kevin williamson are able to keep the quality high , i'll be happy to mark my calendar .

"synopsis : in "" sooner than you think "" america , the future of law enforcement resides in blade squad , a ragtag group of culturally diverse rollerblading cops with jetpacks strapped on their backs . 

a dangerous criminal , however , attempts to destroy blade squad after his brother dies while being chased by them . 

comments : so , what do an ex-gangbanger turned insubordinate traffic cop , a former prostitute with a substance abuse problem , and a junkie turned dennis rodman wannabe turned cop who crashed four police cruisers all have in common ? 

why , they're all members of blade squad , an elite new crimefighting unit wearing black uniforms , rollerblades , and jetpacks ! 

they also carry video cameras so they can communicate with one another a la the marines in james cameron's aliens . 

yes , it's blade squad , the fox network's wednesday night movie of the week . 

this "" movie , "" marking its dubious world premiere today , curiously has a number of guest stars . 

 "" how can a movie have guest stars ? "" 

you may ask . 

well , blade squad is not really a movie so to speak but a 2 hour pilot for a possible tv series packaged as a movie . 

blade squad is dumb . 

blade squad is loud . 

blade squad is obnoxious . 

blade squad will probably be a ratings hit and spawn a long-lived tv series . 

why not ? 

after all , television has given its audience crimefighters with talking cars ( "" knight rider "" ) , fast helicopters ( "" airwolf "" ) , and super fast motorcycles ( "" street hawk "" ) , and viewers have eaten it up in the past . 

so , why not crimefighters with jet-powered roller blades ? 

to be honest , as a made-for-tv presentation , blade squad is at least watchable . 

the film has a relatively large cast of characters , a surprisingly intelligible albeit predictable script , and enough action sequences to keep one half-interested . 

i'd imagine adolescent males , probably the target audience of this turkey , would get a kick out of it . 

i tried to keep that in mind when i watched blade squad . 

i can remember liking "" airwolf "" and "" street hawk "" when i was 10 or 11 . 

and , although this isn't saying much , blade squad is leaps and bounds better than the last fox network movie i had the displeasure of wasting time on : the insipidly awful generation x ( a huge disappointment considering the comic book's terrific two-year beginning ) . 

but , i digress . 

despite its limited appeal , blade squad has a lot of kinks to work out if the movie is to become a tv series . 

one , it suffers from mtv syndrome : a lot of quick shots and weird angles continuously jar the viewer's senses while a near nonstop generic rock soundtrack blares incessantly in the background . 

oh yeah , dylan's "" knockin' on heaven's door "" and bowie's "" i'm afraid of americans "" are used here , in rather poor taste . 

two , blade squad needs a new crew for the sound . 

the substandard sound editing irritated me to no end . 

characters' dialogue , at times , sounded choppy and unintelligible . 

during one important scene , a song played loudly in the background . 

when a character spoke , the song's volume dropped but did not disappear . 

as soon as that character finished speaking , the song's volume immediately returned to its original level until the next character spoke . 

this sounds trivial , i'm sure , but it distracted me immensely . 

finally , this is commercial television . 

foul language is not allowed , typically , on commercial television . 

thus , don't use foul language in a made-for-tv production because that foul language has to be censored in some manner . 

in an early scene of the film , for example , the lead good guy and bad guy have a minor confrontation in the streets . 

when the good guy spouts out a bad word , a driver conveniently honks his car's horn off-screen to muffle the word out . 

in a "" seinfeld "" episode , this technique proved funny ; here , it seemed goofy and cut the dramatic tension considerably . 

perhaps future writers , if a show is spun out of the movie , could take a cue from marvel comics' 2099 series of comics . 

make up a bunch of new bad words for the future . 

this way , you don't need a bunch of honking horns or other silly devices to cover up foul language . 

compared to the usual crap broadcast tv networks have to offer in terms of movies , blade squad is a suitable exercise in camp . 

when compared to , say , a movie studio film , blade squad has a lot in common with a term which shares its initials : bs . 

 ( review written august 12 , 1998 )

"men in black is an explosive mix of science fiction , action , and comedy that hits the target in every possible way . 

although another alien movie , men in black succeeds in every way that independence day didn't , and towers above many other movies of its type . 

the brilliant acting , especially by tommy lee jones as agent kay , is also as good as it gets . 

director barry sonnenfeld , who was behind the camera for the addams family movies and get shorty , has crafted a masterpiece . 

the story behind men in black is just as interesting as you would want it to be . 

the men in black , or mib , are a top-secret governmental agency that is not known to exist . 

the mib are responsible for "" saving the world from the scum of the universe "" . 

a though job , indeed . 

the film opens with a truckload of illegal aliens ( the human kind ) being transported across the mexico border and into the united states . 

presumably , these "" aliens "" are all migrant workers . 

that is , until the mib show up and begin interrogating them . 

agent kay selects a particular suspicious worker and takes him away from the other local authorities to discover that he is not an illegal human alien , but a real extra-terrestrial alien . 

when the alien makes a run for it , agent kay is forced to eliminate the alien with one of the mib's very unique weapons , and after one of the local law enforcement officers witnesses this bizarre occurrence , agent kay is forced to use another very unique device on them . 

the device , described as "" out of state "" , eliminates the memory of anyone it is used on . 

>from here , we are introduced to james edwards , played very well by will smith . 

edwards , a police officer , is chasing a fleeing criminal . 

the criminal gives a very good chase , and at one point when edwards confronts him , the criminal pulls out a very different looking weapon that disintegrated when it hit the ground . 

edwards continues to chase the very athletic criminal to the top of a building , where the criminal informs edwards that he must let him go , because someone is after him . 

edwards doesn't take this seriously , but when the criminal shows very non-human characteristics and leaps off the building , he begins to wonder . 

back at the police station , agent kay shows up to ask edwards a few questions . 

he informs edwards that is was , in fact , a non-human that he was chasing , and that the gun he pulled out was definitely not man-made . 

he has edwards identify the gun , and asks edwards to come to the mib headquarters the following day . 

edwards arrives and finds that he is involved in a recruiting process , along with various other men who seem a bit more qualified than he . 

after goofing up for half of the time , edwards puts on a show at the firing range , and agent kay notes the reason why he feels edwards should be the man to join the mib : he chased down the "" criminal "" on foot , which is something that no one is supposed to be able to do . 

in the meantime , an upstate new york farm has a very close encounter . 

edgar ( vincent d'onofrio ) , owner of the farm , investigates a strange crash landing and is attacked by the inhabitant of the flying object , which presumes to jump inside edgar and use his body as a human transport . 

the "" bug "" , as he is called , is an intergalactic terrorist who has come to earth to attempt to kill two ambassadors . 

and it up to the mib , with newly recruited agent jay ( formerly james edwards ) to exterminate the bug and save the planet from intergalactic war . 

men in black delightfully combines fast-paced action with often hilarious comedy , which is usually from will smith , although tommy lee jones opens up his comedic personality in this film . 

the special effects are also very well done and are not the entire source of the plot , as in another big alien film from the past summer . 

screenwriter ed solomon , writer of super mario bros . 

and the upcoming x-men film , has surely struck gold with this story . 

all ages will enjoy men in black . 

it is an extremely fun film that you will want to see again . 

although it runs a very quick and speedy 96 minutes , the entire film from beginning to end is a non-stop adventure . 

the ending of the film , which ties up a few loose ends for one of the main characters , is also very well done . 

a sequel is already being planned , so there is more to look forward to ! 
"
"this three hour movie opens up with a view of singer/guitar player/musician/composer frank zappa rehearsing with his fellow band members . 

all the rest displays a compilation of footage , mostly from the concert at the palladium in new york city , halloween 1979 . 

other footage shows backstage foolishness , and amazing clay animation by bruce bickford . 

the performance of "" titties and beer "" played in this movie is very entertaining , with drummer terry bozzio supplying the voice of the devil . 

frank's guitar solos outdo any van halen or hendrix i've ever heard . 

bruce bickford's outlandish clay animation is that beyond belief with zooms , morphings , etc . and actually , it doesn't even look like clay , it looks like meat . 
"
"absolute power , the new film produced and directed by clint eastwood , attempts to be a thriller set in the world of hypocritical presidents and their murderous political staff . 

it is about as thrilling as a lecture on the mating habits of the south american grasshopper . 

one can only wonder how an utterly absurd script like the one written by william goldman could have ever interested eastwood . 

not only is the plot unbelievable and contrived , but even the writing itself lacks any consistency or intelligence . 

continually underestimating the audience , the film gives us information we already know or dont even need . 

details essential to the story are so improbably convenient they are annoying ( like why would two unprepared secret service men carry two night-vision goggles in their car ? ) . 

oddly enough , the initial setup for absolute power offers interesting possibilities . 

a masterful jewel-thief ( played by clint eastwood ) witnesses the murder of the wife of a powerful millionaire ( played by e . g . 

marshall ) . 

while robbing one of marshalls mansions , he is forced to hide in the bedrooms vault . 

there , through a two-way mirror , he sees the wife and another man engage in passionate foreplay . 

their game of love quickly turns into a violent struggle as the man starts beating the woman . 

in self defense , the woman grabs a letter-opener and stabs the man in the elbow . 

she raises her arm to stab again when she is fatally shot by two secret service men . 

the man ? 

he is the president of the united states of america . 

where does the film go wrong ? 

it cannot be the acting . 

clint eastwood , ed harris and gene hackman as the president give type-cast , but decent performances . 

the cinematography is sufficient ; wild and erratic during action sequences , dark and mysterious during psychologically suspenseful scenes , and calm and warm during dramatic dialogue . 

even the music is not as bombastic as it usually tends to be in the thriller/suspense genre . 

the fault clearly lies in the screenplay , and the screenplay alone . 

while setting up a story about misuse of power , about the true possessors of that power , and about intrigue and double-crossing , it does not resolve it . 

not one buildup of suspense is resolved by an exciting climax . 

rather , the tense situations are left dangling at the end , giving the viewer an uneasy sense of incompleteness . 

an example of this is a very promising and tense buildup of a scene : in an attempt to arrest clint eastwood , the police have set up a trap at a small restaurant . 

police officers are everywhere , incognito of course . 

at the same time , not one but two hit men are preparing to kill clint eastwood when he arrives . 

all three parties are unaware of each others presence . 

this scene is tremendously exciting and the audience is wondering how clint eastwood , who might suspect this is a trap , will get himself out of this difficult position . 

he will probably have a brilliant plan , involving ingenious preparations . 

however , when he arrives at the trap , both hit men miss ( how convenient ) and in the confusion eastwood simply walks away . 

the buildup of this scene took about ten minutes . 

ten minutes of close ups of the hit men loading their weapons intercut with the police preparing for the trap . 

the scene was resolved in less than 20 seconds . . . 

parallel to the story line of catching the real killer is a cliche emotional tale about the estranged relationship between father eastwood and his daughter . 

the daughter blames her father for never being there for her , because he was either in jail or robbing a house somewhere . 

of course their relationship takes a turn for the better during the adventure and they end up a happy family . 

again , it is commendable that absolute power tries to deviate from the mainstream suspense film by giving room for a dramatic subplot . 

however , trying is simply not enough ! 

the second story line should be subtle , original and preferably unpredictable . . . 

everything this film is not . 

how could a screenplay like absolute power ever get the funding to be produced ? 

how could eastwood , who has successfully produced and directed many outstanding films such as the brilliant unforgiven , ever believe in a project like this one ? 

i am sad to say that my respect for the actor/director/producer has diminished substantially due to this film . 

director quentin tarantino once said : "" i can make a good movie out of any bad script . "" 

director clint eastwood obviously cannot . 
"
"if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films it's their predictable endings . 

the devil's advocate has the atypical hollywood ending , when everything that should happen does . 

unfortunately for the devil's advocate , this ending nearly collapses in on itself , and ruins the entire film . 

nevertheless , the film does provide two and a half hours of pure entertainment ( note to self : kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film ) . 

i don't think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan . 

well , it does contain this element , but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements ( and seemingly more interesting ones at that ) . 

the devil's advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session . 

kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is the defense attorney , working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl . 

he ends up with a not-guilty verdict , despite an emotional testimony from the victim ( heather matarazzo ) . 

he leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann ( charlize theron ) where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury . 

he accepts ( mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive ) and he flies to new york with his wife . 

after proving his worth for selecting juries ( and his perfect winning streak in court ) , the head of the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) , asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer . 

he graciously accepts , where he is treated almost as a god . 

he is given an incredible apartment ( which is bigger than my entire house now ) , and a hefty paycheck . 

his life seems to be on the rise . 

and of course , his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline . 

he is attracted to fellow employee christabella ( connie nielson ) , and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment . 

mary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice , especially if it is not wanted . 

meanwhile , kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen ( craig t . nelson ) who apparently murdered three people . 

he spends hours upon hours with this case , while forgetting his loving wife , who may or may not be going insane . 

all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself . 

after a while , things turn completely upside-down , as kevin's wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends . 

a fellow employee is murdered in the park , and his mother ( judith ivey ) reveals information about kevin's real father . 

is it all just a big nightmare ? 

or is john milton really satan , playing tricks with kevin's life ? 

the devil's advocate plays out fairly straight-forward , but for some odd reason , the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don't expect . 

is this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed ? 

if so , the devil's advocate messes up completely , and ironically , i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now , than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early . 

i went into the devil's advocate expecting a shocking horror film , and that is exactly what i got . 

i was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally , and that is what i got . 

but what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending ( did i mention that i didn't like the ending ? ) . 

the producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending , they pull the rug out from under you . 

films like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected , more or less . 

we know it is going to end in an unpredictable way . 

the devil's advocate , on the other hand , ends unpredictably , not from us knowing a lot , but knowing nothing at all . 

if that is confusing , i recommend watching the film , and then reading that again . 

as for the film overall , i enjoyed the entire first two hours , being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study . 

the film runs like a well-built clock , slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax ( and an unpredictable one at that ) . 

and then you settle in for a nice resolution , which does not occur . 

it was at this point that i felt cheated . 

taking us on a terror ride of intrigue , we follow kevin lomax around , as he is the centerpiece of the film . 

everything occurs from his perspective . 

he is our representation on screen ( sort of ) . 

but we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game . 

i don't want to spoil the ending , so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself . 

perhaps the most shocking thing about the devil's advocate is the extreme amount of everything . 

it earned its r rating for a reason . 

there is plenty of nudity , sex , violence , gore , and then you have gore , violence , sex , and more nudity . 

this film really isn't subtle about anything , showing us everything . 

it actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc-17 rating , as it is quite harsh . 

however , the movie does have its merits , and nudity and sex are among those . 

i don't condone sex and nudity in films , but if its there , i might as well enjoy it . 

the biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch . 

the confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining , but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife , mary ann . 

portrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron , mary ann's problems are incredibly intense , and i found myself wanting to witness her decline . 

this may sound uncaring , but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her . 

she is the most interesting character on the screen , who is forced into a world where she is not wanted . 

something the devil's advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity , especially for a film of this nature . 

the story actually has something to say about humanity . 

in one of the last scenes , john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children ( he is satan , of course ) . 

he comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity . 

then , god sets up rules which contradict human nature . 

this semi-religious bashing is more humorous than frightening . 

what milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud , partially thinking it was funny , but patially realizing it was true . 

these moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil's advocate , giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing ( but i'm sure they came straight from the novel it was based on ) . 

when a film has something to say about our society , it deserves to be watched . 

the cast of the devil's advocate is one of the highlights , as we see memorable faces , and they put spins on those memorable faces we don't expect . 

heather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case , and she does a great job . 

probably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves . 

he has proven himself an uneven actor ( successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic ) , but he tops himself with this performance . 

i have never seen him more believable to date . 

al pacino is of course the scene stealer . 

his devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson ( the witches of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( needful things ) . 

he could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes , but he remains completely believable ( if that is the correct term ) . 

jeffrey jones ( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller's day off ) also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon . 

judith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin's past . 

connie nielson is very effective in her role , and she also appears naked several times . 

one familiar face with a twist was "" coach "" star , craig t . nelson , who gives a very good performance . 

the devil's advocate is rated r for sexuality , nudity , violence , language , and some gore . 

at 144 minutes , this film moves along fairly quickly . 

for the first two hours , i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters . 

the technical quality is also remarkable , with great special effects and a good musical score . 

director taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture , only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes . 

i guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film , and hackford gave me just that for a long time . 

but just before the end , he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream . 

personally , i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early .

"what happens when you put martin lawrence in a fat suit in real life ? 

you get martin lawrence in a coma ( the comedian thought he was getting fat , so he put on numerous layers of heavy clothing and went jogging in 100 degree heat , ending up in a coma ) . 

so what happens when you put martin lawrence in a fat suit in the movies ? 

you get an audience in a coma . 

in big momma's house , lawrence plays a fbi agent who's a master of disguises . 

when a naughty , naughty man escapes from jail and seeks out his former girlfriend ( the very sexy nia long . . . 

the only thing worth looking at in this movie ) , she flees to georgia to stay with her rather large southern aunt "" big momma "" ( ella mitchell ) . 

the fbi follows her in order to recover the large sum of money stolen in the bank robbery that sent the naughty man to jail . 

however , big momma is called away on an emergency . 

sensing that they could lose their only chance to capture the criminal , lawrence goes undercover as big momma . 

and let the comedy begin ! 

big momma's house is the definition of a "" gimmick "" movie if there ever was one . 

the plot can basically be summed up as "" martin lawrence dresses up as a fat woman "" . . . 

and even that description is too wordy . 

you can just see this script plotted out on a chalkboard with martin lawrence/fat woman in the middle of the board with a big circle around it , and all sorts of clich ? d , "" humorous "" situations pointing to it . 

fat woman plays basketball ! 

fat woman takes a dump ! 

fat woman kung fu ! 

well they left one off the board . . . 

movie critic slips into coma ! 

paul giamatti ( private parts , the negotiator ) plays lawrence's partner and as much as i enjoy his work , even he can't inject life into this lifeless comedy . 

hell , the greatest performers on the planet couldn't make this material work . . . 

it's just that awful .

"review : ghost dog : the way of the samurai ( 1999 ) 

cast : forest whitaker , henry silva , cliff gorman , john tormey , gene riffini , victor argo , tricia vessey , isaach de bankole' , camille winbush director : jim jarmusch writer : jim jarmusch 

rating : good shot ( stars ) 

languid , yet pointed and focused , ghost dog : the way of the samurai sublimely savages our cultural fascination with the mafia and the sleek , ultra-cool , cinematic image of the hitman . 

juxtaposing the samurai's honor code of feudal japan against the tradition bound modus operandi of the american/italian mafia , it ceaselessly chips away with a sculptor's precision at the archaic foundations of both as they lumber , dinosaur-like , to function in the modern era . 

director jarmusch gleefully plays the iconoclast , ripping into mafioso precepts with splashes of acidic wit . 

using a palate of bleached colors , jarmusch lugubriously maintains a tone of desolation that belies the many sparks of laugh out loud humor punctuating the film . 

he doesn't cater to audience expectations of hyper-colorized , stylized violence and gunplay where no one dies . 

the action is presented in flat , brutal codas . 

bullets have permanence . 

death has consequences . 

the movie rises beyond standard conventions to become a meditation on the concepts of honor and loyalty . 

it is an anti-movie , of sorts . 

there are few photogenic , empathetic characters for the audience to fall in love with . 

this isn't a film that lovingly holds your hand . 

there are dark , contemplative moments and the film firmly holds you by the shoulder , just so , asserting itself for all to see . 

the fulcrum for the movie's thematic balancing act is ghost dog , a mafia hitman . 

a twist on the stereotypical image of the mob enforcer , ghost dog is a hilarious contradiction in terms . 

unlike the sleek , muscular killing machines one is accustomed to , we are given an inner city black man who is overweight and slovenly , replete with chapped , dirty hands and rumpled clothing . 

he wears a hooded sweatshirt , which he often pulls over his head , giving him a monk-like appearance . 

there are no acrobatic back flips and shiny super guns in his arsenal . 

he uses old , worn weapons and simply goes about his tasks in economical , efficient and pleasureless fashion . 

ghost dog is a disciple of the old ways of the samurai , distilling the essence of his life through the filter of a book , which he reads daily , hagakure : the way of the samurai . 

life consists of simple pleasures for him : ice cream , warm rooftop naps and good books . 

ghost dog lives , as it were , by the basic tenet expressed by his book ; one should start each day considering oneself as dead . 

living atop an abandoned building , surrounded by his flock of pet carrier pigeons , ghost dog exists in a netherworld lacking creature comforts and friends . 

he craves nothing more . 

as he puts it late in the film , "" i've seen all i want to see . "" 

he exists in a spiritual world of the mind , gaining moral sustenance from his readings . 

ghost dog wasn't always as he is presented . 

in several roshomon-like flashbacks , it's shown how ghost dog was assaulted by racist white males and beaten nearly to death until the timely intervention of a good samaritan , that "" samaritan "" being a foot soldier in an aging crime family . 

ghost dog pledges his life to the service of the man , louie ( tormey ) , as repayment . 

after years of loyal service , ghost dog is sent , by louie , to kill "" handsome frank "" , a made man within louie's organization who has run away with the crime boss's daughter , louise ( vessey ) . 

ghost dog wordlessly executes his task , witnessed by louise , whom he spares , as she sits watching a betty boop cartoon , clutching a copy of the book , roshomon . 

in a bit of synchronicity , louise loans the book to ghost dog . 

upset that frank was taken out by someone not from the family , the mob bosses , in turn , put out a hit on ghost dog in a perverse twist of loyalty to their assassinated comrade . 

the rest of movie holds the dated value systems of both the mafia and ghost dog up to the light of a new millennium with many acerbic asides as the two come factions come into conflict . 

the theme of old cartoons flares up time and again , each time showing cartoon violence that is in sharp counterpoint to the reality of ghost dog's world . 

each time a character is shown watching a cartoon , it's from the same era , betty boop , felix the cat , etc . , a reflection of days gone by . 

near the end , louise is watching a cartoon that's a departure from the previously shown ones . 

it's a bit of audacity on jarmusch's part that is nicely effective , despite it's surrealistic nature . 

as ghost dog floats through his world , his life is touched by two people . 

one is a sage little girl ( winbush ) who connects with ghost dog through their love of reading . 

she comes to symbolize a melding of the old ways and new sensibilities , just as louise ultimately does . 

by film's end , the fact that jamusch is so effective at illustrating the tenuous bond between the two is a testament to his skill as a writer . 

the other person in ghost dog's world is an ice cream ( de bankole' ) vendor who only speaks french , yet intuitively shares a rapport with ghost dog . 

the vendor is the literal stranger in a strange land . 

jarmusch , through rapper/composer rza , underscores his film with rap and reggae music , which at first blush seems dichotomous , but its primal rhythms serve to strengthen the fundamental nature of the movie . 

ghost dog seems to draw some type of strength from the rap music he listens to as he negotiates the streets in various stolen cars . 

 ( which , in and of itself , presents another paradox about ghost's dog's sense of honor . ) 

the head mafioso is played by henry silva with a stone faced resignation . 

of all the cartoonish mobsters , he is the only one who appears self aware of his state in the world . 

gorman plays sonny , a lieutenant who respects the old ways , yet has a quirky affinity for rap music , a love comically shown in several impromptu displays . 

ruffini seems the truest reflection of the mafia . 

he is a husk of a man , assisted by two hearing aids , who barks out advice without truly hearing what he , or others are saying . 

whitaker carries the film by using what truly great actor's use , his face . 

ghost dog is reticent to speak , often going for long periods without doing so . 

the fact that whitaker can convey such a wide range of emotion through a gesture or look is a remarkable talent . 

although the film has a deliberate pace , some of the late night drives and walks taken by ghost dog dragged the momentum down . 

truly tragic is how ghost dog misinterprets japanese honor in his final confrontation with the mob . 

he reveals himself to be so desperate for spiritual guidance through the hagakure that he fails to truly adapt it to what is real and true in his world . 

carried on the shoulders of a remarkable performance by whitaker , ghost dog rises beyond being a characterization or icon , into a figure that garners sympathy , if not a bit of pity .

"sometimes i find 19th century british costume dramas a little hard to relate to . 

it's not the time or the distance , it's the rules and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy . 

yet somehow , the movies are all well made and i always get caught up in the story . 

the wings of the dove fits the pattern . 

kate ( helena bonham carter ) and merton ( linus roache ) are in love . 

merton , a newspaper writer , would like to marry kate . 

but kate's "" job "" , if you will , is to be a member of the british upper class . 

her father lost all of her family's money , but a wealthy aunt agreed to take care of her until she married a nice rich man . 

naturally , a newspaper writer's wages don't count as "" rich . "" 

kate leads him on , but she always ends up giving him the cold shoulder , ultimately because he's not marriageable . 

kate's american friend millie ( alison elliot ) stops in for a visit on her way to venice . 

at a party , millie catches a glimpse of merton and likes what she sees . 

kate realizes that if merton were introduced to millie , he might forget about her . 

it appears that she is trying to spare him from the heartbreak of their inevitable breakup . 

merton sees what kate is doing and resents her for it . 

he is still in love with kate , and will accept no substitute . 

the three of them , along with a fourth friend ( elizabeth mcgovern ) end up on holiday in venice together , where their interactions are quite complicated . 

let's sum up : millie has fallen for merton . 

merton has no feelings for millie because he is still in love with kate . 

kate loves him but can't marry him , so on the one hand she's trying to match him up with someone who will make him happy , but on the other hand she's jealous of them as a couple . 

a clear solution presents itself to kate when she realizes that millie is very sick - dying , in fact . 

at this point she decides that merton should marry millie until she dies . 

millie will leave her money to merton , who will then be rich enough to marry kate . 

she lets merton know of her schemes and , since it will help him win kate , he reluctantly agrees . 

kate leaves venice so that the two m's can be alone together . 

merton finds that pretending to love millie is a lot like actually loving her . 

he's not sure he can separate the two . 

kate finds that she's not so sure she really wants her merton falling in love with and marrying anyone else . 

the brilliant scheme proves to be painful to all involved . 

without revealing the details , suffice it to say that the situation ends badly . 

the title refers to the object of merton's vain hope that something might lift him from his predicament . 

one is left with feelings of regret and despair . 

what started as such a promising relationship was damaged by greed , anger , and jealousy . 

an interesting thought struck me after the movie was over , and that is that the wings of the dove almost fits the story line of a film noir . 

a couple conspires to cheat someone out of their money so they can live happily ever after . 

their involvement in the deception makes each less attractive to the other , and after a few things go wrong , the whole idea seems like an awful life-ruining mistake . 

i wouldn't call the wings of the dove a film noir , but the comparison is interesting . 

as i have acknowledged before , i am not a wonderful judge of acting , but i liked the performances from roache and elliot . 

roache successfully conveyed his character's ambivalence toward millie : near the end , he hugs her , at first staring into space , as if he's thinking about his plan with kate , then giving that up to fully embrace millie . 

millie's part didn't require as much range , but elliot gave her the necessary bubbly personality that made her irresistible . 

i will probably file away the wings of the dove in the same low-traffic corner of my mind as sense and sensibility and persuasion . 

their settings are far removed from my personal experience - geographically , historically , and socially . 

still , the movies are well made and the stories inevitably win me over .

"back in february at the monthly los angeles comic book and science fiction convention , new line cinema put on a lavish presentation for its big-screen update of the cult 1960s sci-fi tv show lost in space , complete with in-person appearances by cast members mimi rogers , matt leblanc , lacey chabert , jack johnson , and even gary oldman . 

that should have set off my warning alarms--the last time such an extravagant film presentation took place at the convention was nearly five years ago , when none other than arnold schwarzenegger made an in-person cameo to peddle . . . 

last action hero . 

but no , like millions of others , i bought into the hype and "" got lost . "" 

if only i had gotten lost--literally--on the way to theatre and spared myself the tedium of this sloppily slapped-together blockbuster wannabe . 

you may find yourself wondering if director stephen hopkins and screenwriter akiva goldsman were lost themselves when they made the film . 

at the convention , goldsman claimed to be a rabid fan of the original television series , and if that really is the case , i'd hate to see what he does with concepts he only has mild interest in . 

to say that his script lacks narrative cohesion is to imply that there is a narrative to begin with--which there most certainly is not . 

after the setup , in which the robinson family--father john ( william hurt , looking and sounding as spaced out as he does in interviews ) , mother maureen ( rogers , wasted ) , daughters judy ( heather graham , ditto ) and penny ( a heavily made-up chabert , looking like a junior version of neve campbell in wild things ) , and son will ( young newcomer johnson , making the best of it ) --and pilot don west ( leblanc , doing a bad han solo impression ) find themselves lost in space after their ship is sabotaged by evil stowaway dr . smith ( a watered-down but still-lively oldman , cashing a paycheck and loving every minute ) , the script's "" stream "" of events becomes so fragmented and random that it seems to be made up as it goes along--and hopkins does little to make what does go on the slightest bit interesting . 

they encounter another ship . 

they board it . 

alien spiders attack them . 

they return to their ship . 

the other one explodes . 

they land on a deserted planet . 

and so on . 

an attempt at a plot involving time travel occurs in the third act , but goldsman doesn't seem to understand the rules that come with using such a story device ; when one character's past self dies , the future incarnation inexplicably lives on . 

the look and effects should be lost in space's ace-in-the-hole , but hopkins even manages to botch that . 

for a big-budget film , the visual effects are incredibly shoddy . 

in one composite background shot , i could see the blue outline around oldman ; the various digital effects for the space battle scenes look like . . . 

digital effects . 

but nothing in those shots is as jaw-droppingly unconvincing as blawp , a monkey-like space creature that becomes penny's pet . 

entirely computer-generated and every inch showing it , blawp looks like it was lifted directly from a sony playstation game . 

apparently hopkins thought the same and tried desperately to hide it ; how else can one explain the graininess of blawp's composite shots with the human actors ? 

but in doing so , the seams are that much more obvious . 

you have to be severely visually impaired to not be distracted when a grainy shot of penny and blawp is immediately followed by a crystal-clear solo reaction shot of judy . 

new line is hoping lost in space will become a big franchise much like the long-running star trek cash cow at paramount . 

i don't think so . 

in a few years , the lost in space movie will likely live on not as a series but as the obscure answer to a trivia question : what film ended titanic's 15-week reign at the top of the weekend box office ? 
"
"in my review of there's something about mary , i said something to the effect of "" laughter isn't everything . "" 

i now need to make a brief addendum to my postulate : laughter isn't everything , unless i'm watching a jim abrahams film . 

see , spoofs are easy with me . 

i love movies , and i love movies that make fun of movies that i love . 

sometimes i'm the only one in the theater laughing . 

sometimes i laugh so hard that i embarass myself because my laugh is so high-pitched in comparison to my speaking voice ( it cuts right through everyone else's laughter ) . 

sometimes i laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore by the end of the film . 

abraham's latest film , mafia ! , induced this kind of hysteria upon me . 

it's gotten some mediocre reviews , but , hey , i'm the guy who laughs at everything . 

there may be a lot of jokes that flop in this film , but there are far more that work , and i laughed so frequently that the failed jokes usually occurred as i was recovering from the previous bout of giddy madness . 

i enjoy films like this because not one second of it is serious or thought-provoking . 

most lighweight films that pose as comedies try to do other things , like develop characters , shape stories , and other such nonsense . 

mafia ! 

has no pretentions about characters or story , and it exists for no other reason than to make people laugh . 

the film begins on the perfect high note , with a mockery of the opening of casino . 

our hero ( jay mohr ) is seen walking from a casino and getting into his car , which subsequently explodes and sends him flying through the air against a backdrop of flowing fire . 

to describe the story of mafia ! 

is absurd and pointless , but i will mention that it basically follows the framework of the godfather films , with a lot of casino references inserted throughout . 

along the way , the parodies seem arbitrary , and rarely victimize mob films : pictures like the english patient , forrest gump , and jaws undergo severe and hilarious bashing . 

movies like this rely on just a few things , but the most important element is direction . 

abrahams has been down this path many times before ( hot shots ! , top secret ! , airplane ! , and any other film with an exclamation point in the title ) , and so i hold most of the success of mafia ! 

to his experience . 

he takes just the right attitude in each scene , and manages to wring at least a bit laughter out of even the most oddly placed references ( one inexplicable moment seems like it wants to make fun of titanic , but it never develops ) . 

the actors are all energetic , which helps a lot with the tone of the film . 

mohr ( suicide kings , paulie ) , who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors , is so good here . 

he looks like he's having so much fun that he's containing his laughter in every scene ( watch his face in the sequence by the swimming pool ) . 

he's probably the only performer in the cast who manages to urge laughter without the help of the material . 

lloyd bridges does a decent imitation of brando's godfather , while pamela gidley is dead-on in a full-blown mockery of sharon stone . 

the hard thing about writing reviews for comedies is that i'm supposed to give examples of things and be specific . 

unfortunately , i was so constantly blindsided by laughter during mafia ! 

that i can't remember a lot of what made me laugh . 

but that's a good sign : mafia ! 

is so funny that i wasn't even given time to apply any of the scenes to memory . 

i laughed so hard that it shut off my brain . 

i know that doesn't sound particularly complimentary , but when watching a dumb comedy like this , the first thing i want to do is shut off my brain . 

finally , a film that does this for me . 
"
"the working title for no looking back was long time , nothing new , and rarely has there been a more apt name for a motion picture . 

even though this movie clocks in at a relatively skinny 96 minutes , it seems to run long enough to engulf two titanics . 

writer/director edward burns has trotted out a hackneyed storyline , the trajectory of which will be instantly recognizable to anyone who hasn't spent their life in seclusion . 

instead of tweaking the formula a little to invigorate the proceedings , burns is content to allow the film to ramble aimlessly towards its irritatingly predictable conclusion , offering precious few momentary pleasures along the way . 

no looking back is dominated by three very dislikable characters whose constant presence on the screen is painful . 

the most appropriate ending would have been a triple suicide , and the sooner , the better . 

alas , that's not the case , and those who stick with this film for its entire length will be forced to endure the prolonged company of this wretched trio . 

and , to further depress audiences , burns has shot the entire film on cold , rainy days in a gray new york state beach town . 

peeks of sunshine are few and far between . 

no wonder the characters are all so miserable . 

first of all , we have charlie ( burns ) , a generation x slacker who abandoned his girlfriend three years ago after she had an abortion , then spent some time bumming around in california before deciding to come home . 

that girlfriend is claudia ( lauren holly ) , and , after picking up the pieces of her life following charlie's departure , she has moved on , shacking up with one of charlie's old school buddies , mike ( jon bon jovi ) . 

the two have a comfortable relationship , but it's apparent to even a blind person that they're not right for each other . 

claudia years for some spice in her life ; mike wants to settle down and have children . 

then charlie re-enters the mix . 

so who , if anyone , will claudia end up with ? 

who cares ? ? 

no looking back goes to extraordinary lengths to make sure that we're not especially interested in the outcome of the romantic triangle . 

so what if no one finds happiness -- these characters don't deserve it anyway , especially after wasting 90 minutes of our time . 

they aren't real people -- they're a writer's construct stumbling through a too-obvious storyline . 

they should know the ending as well as we do . 

and burns should have given his audience more credit and presented them with a plot that at least offered a surprise or two . 

another frustrating thing about no looking back is that burns has populated the film with a group of potentially-interesting supporting characters . 

blythe danner is solid as claudia's housebound mother , connie britton is suitably high-strung as claudia's neurotic sister , and jennifer esposito is eye-catching as a bartender in search of a little romance . 

sadly , all we get is quick glimpses into their lives , although a movie about any of them would have been far more intriguing than the story burns has chosen to tell . 

none of the lead performers are going to wow critics with their thespian attributes . 

edward burns is pushing the edge of his limited range here . 

jon bon jovi shows more acting ability than one might reasonably expect from a singer branching into a different career , but he could still use a little polish . 

the worst case is lauren holly , who presents a completely bland claudia . 

as portrayed here , she's hardly the kind of woman who would inspire even a moment's interest , not to mention undying love . 

burns' ex , the monumentally untalented maxine bahns , would have been hard-pressed to do a less inspired job . 

when he released the brothers mcmullen , edward burns was revered as the wunderkind of the 1995 sundance film festival ( robert redford has apparently stuck with him -- the aging actor/director executive produced this mess ) . 

two films and three short years later , the luster has faded . 

some movie makers have only one good film in them . 

with back- to-back duds like she's the one and no looking back to follow the delightful brothers , burns is beginning to look like a member of that undistinguished club . 
"
"contrary to the title , "" the boxer "" is not another rocky story only this time spliced with some cold hard politics . 

it's actually three movies in one : a political film , a boxing film , and a love story . 

all of these work in their own respects and have some pretty decent balancing betwixt the three elements of the story , but somehow it seems kind of cliched and unoriginal . 

we've seen it all before , and we're just not blown away with it like we should be . 

oh well . 

it's still an excellent irish story . 

 "" the boxer "" of the title is danny flynn ( jim sheridan staple daniel day-lewis ) , an ex-ira member who gets out of a belfast prison after 14 years , and finds out that his troubles are far from over . 

first off , the ira is having a small civil war between its leader joe hamill ( brian cox ) , and one of its sub-leaders , harry ( gerard mcsorley ) , both having opposing views on getting many of their members out of jail . 

while this is going on , danny and his old drunkard buddie , ike ( ken stott , who played the chief inspector in danny boyle's "" shallow grave "" ) , re-open an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects , protestant and catholics , to work together . 

danny not only begins teaching kids how to box , but has stayed in great shape whilst in prison , and is ready to start boxing real people again . 

and danny runs into his ex-love , maggie ( "" breaking the waves "" 's emily watson ) , who hasn't seen him since he went in . 

they don't easily start up their romance again because she's the wife of a prisoner whom she married during danny's tenure in prison , and also has a son , liam ( ciaran fitzgerald ) , from him , whom liam is hoping will get out soon . 

but the two are slowly re-drawn to eachother again , and this begins to complicate things . 

the political story is nothing really special but works in itself . 

we've seen it many a time before , but it's at least interesting , sometimes emotional , and even riveting at times . 

there's a big riot towards the middle of the film which is frightening in its brutality and honesty . 

the boxing story is very minor to the story , but does represent people coming together to fight eachother fairly , and even with good sportsmanship . 

there are only a few boxing scenes , but they're never like "" raging bull "" /let's-strip-down-the-sport-to-its-bones brilliant . 

they're more realistic , and instead of bone crunching , we hear the sound of the gloves hitting eachother , which is slightly unerving at times . 

and i didn't know daniel day-lewis was in such good shape . 

but the backbone of the story is the love one . 

because these characters are given such horrible circumstances , and since the two leads have such great chemistry together , we really feel for their plight . 

as the film goes on , and circumstances get worse and worse , the characters have to make real human decisions , and we can sympathize with them as humans not characters . 

this is how you write a love story - take note , hollywood . 

these elements are pretty much equally balanced , with each of the parts of the stories working hand-in-hand with eachother . 

i loved how each of the different parts of the plot mattered , and sometimes spilled over into the next . 

it made sure that we didn't just care for one of them . 

i'm not saying they're all equally great , because the love story really carries the film , but at least they all work out respectively . 

the acting is amazing , with day-lewis and watson giving excellent performances and showing great chemistry . 

i'm not sure if they're oscar-nominee bound , but they're very good . 

in the supporting roles , billy cox is greatly sympathetic as the ira leader losing control of his daughter and his workers . 

but the film is stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike , who is just a great scene stealer . 

the direction and co-writing by jim sheridan ( with the other co-writing credit going to terry george ) is excellent , rounding out the characters well , but not pacing everything greatly . 

i noticed that the first half was very leisurely ( yet fascinating ) , but the second half whirls by at a quick pace , and ends much too quickly . 

more time could have been spent thinking up the ending , since it does seem quite sloppy . 

though "" the boxer "" is a good film , it never achieves the greatness that it should . 

sure , it's a masterpiece compared to most of the hollywood drivel we usually get , but on it's own , it just could have been better . 

but it still works out , gives us a great love story combined with a political and boxing drama , and features great acting . 

even if it could have been better , this'll do .

"`we run tings . 

tings don't run we . ' 

-sound advice from capone ( paul campbell ) to his squaddie ( or partner ) , floyd ( winston bell ) . 

jamaican film , shot entirely on video , featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo-styled brotherhood morals ( and a little gunplay ) . 

capone , a tough as nails super cop , gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home ( while he was with his lady ) and killed his partner in front of him . 

when he arrives , he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse , thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie ( jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw ) , so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook ) . 

capone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and , much to his disappointment , also finds out his childhood friend ratty ( mark danvers ) has been helping him . 

torn between doing his job and protecting his best friend , capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again . 

directed deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne ( assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct ) , one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while . 

shots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films , although the action isn't as hyperkinetic as most of woo's films are . 

the action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though , and eventually begin to take on a life of their own ( beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after ) . 

the make-up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well , with flawless squib work on display from the effects team . 

the cast is superb and listening to their dialogue , spoken with thick jamaican accents ( half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang ) , just adds to the interest . 

paul campbell , as the `loose cannon' capone , essays his role perfectly , displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times . 

mark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty , the part-time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together . 

unfortunately , carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective ( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him ) , but then again , that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed . 

the music in the film is composed of all reggae songs , and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists , sly and robbie ( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones , maxi priest , bob dylan , james brown , grace jones , herbie hancock , bootsy collins , and carly simon among others ) . 

the end credit song , `we run tings' , by the group red dragon , is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review . 

oddly enough , desmond ballentine ( who plays the character deportee ) is well known as a pioneer in the realm of `gangsta' reggae as the performer ninjaman , and he doesn't contribute a single song to the film ( that i could see ) , which is virtually unheard of here in the us . 

at the time of this writing , third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us , coming off of a six-month box-office breaking run in jamaica , where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time ( bringing in $21 million in jamaica , which is roughly $500 , 000 us ) . 

palm pictures ( the company that released the offbeat , but entertaining six-string samurai ) is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market , i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters . 

chris blackwell , founder of palm pictures , was also involved in the production of another jamaican box-office smash in 1981 entitled countryman , so i'd say he has a pretty good track record . 

overall , third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo , ringo lam , tsui hark , and many other action films by directors from hong kong . 

if action films are your thing and you don't mind intermittent subtitles , then you can't go wrong with this film . 

the performances and the story are solid ( if only a little cliched ) and the action is tight . 

i'm not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like , but apparently third world cop's honors are well deserved .

"vampire lore and legend has always been a popular fantasy element , substantiated by not only the sheer number of movies about the subject , but also the proliferation of cults and sects of adherents . 

and , unlike any of the more outlandish myths , the vampire holds some real-world probability ( one study claims 1 , 000 bloodsuckers exist worldwide , and places 50 in los angeles ) . 

but lest the nasties be mistaken for simple comic book bad guys , john carpenter would like to remind us that they are - and always have been - a truly frightening element of the thriller genre . 

and remind us he does in his latest film , vampires . 

there was some question , as halloween weekend approached , of how well vampires would do in comparison to new line cinema's immensely successful blade , released in august . 

the two films take noticeably different stands on the vampire issue , and don't even agree on some basic points of the slaying method . 

 ( for instance , blade's main weapons are silver and garlic , whereas main character jack crow's technique is a wooden stake to the heart . ) 

blade also gives more of a face to the vampire civilization , while carpenter would like us to remain in the dark about how the pasties operate . 

both have their advantages , and here , carpenter's style lends itself to a darker breed of suspense rather than the action movie that blade director stephen norrington delievered . 

when it's all said and done , though , the vampires still kill and die with a bloody flourish ; the level for gore is indeed set to maximum . 

this time , our hero is vatican-sponsored slayer jack crow ( james woods ) . 

he's a cynical , battle-worn veteran , and the best of his bunch . 

he and his team are responsible for cleaning out the american southwest , and after exterminating a nest one night , they run up against a super-vampire ( termed a "" master "" ) named valek ( thomas ian griffith ) . 

valek kills all of jack's team except for his partner , tony montoya ( daniel baldwin ) , and as the two regroup , they learn that valek is the original vampire - now over six hundred years old . 

apparently , valek and his minions have been sweeping the southwest for decades in search of a cross that will enable them to walk in the daytime . 

so with the aid of a priest named adam ( tim guinee ) and a bitten hooker ( sheryl lee ) as bait , they track valek down for the final confrontation . 

the script for vampires , written by don jakoby and based on the john steakley novel , is perhaps the wittiest piece of screenplay to see production all year . 

crow , in particular , is a fun source of one-liners , and woods does every one of them with perfect stoicism . 

baldwin , lee , and guinee are all fine supports , adding to the character pool , but the other true highlight of the movie is thomas ian griffith's bad guy . 

griffith's intense expression is perfect for the role , and the only downside is that he's got to talk sometime . 

luckily , he's got few lines , and manages to pull off a rather thrilling performance . 

all said , fans will surely be impressed by this picture , and those who found apt pupil a bit limp will be excited by this one . 

certainly a worthwhile visit to the theaters .

"film adaptation of hunter s . thompson's infamous semi-autobiographical hallucinogen-fueled book of the same title . 

director terry gilliam of twelve monkeys ( 8/10 ) and brazil ( 7/10 ) fame , took over the helm of this project after fellow director alex cox ( sid and nancy ( 7 . 5/10 ) ) 

 "" apparently alienated everyone associated with the movie "" , according to gilliam . 

plot : writer thompson ( depp ) heads down to las vegas with his attorney dr . gonzo ( del toro ) to cover a motorcycle race . 

during their trip , they systematically consume "" two bags of grass , seventy-five pellets of mescaline , five sheets of high powered blotter acid , a salt shaker half-full of cocaine , a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers , downers , screamers , laughers , a quart of tequila , a quart of rum , a case of beer , a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls . 

the movie presents us with the results of that heavy drug use . 

critique : i have given this movie two separate ratings because i believe that the enjoyment of this psychedelic picture is highly correlated with the amount of drugs or alcohol that would be floating around in the viewer's own mind , whilst inhaling this cinematic vision of excess . 

if you are prepared to get high or intoxicated before watching this film , i would say that this is one picture that you will thoroughly enjoy on a multitude of colorful levels . 

if , on the other hand , you decide to stray from the addition of nefarious elements to your system , i could not imagine you truly appreciating much of this drug-induced picture's entire ride ( 5 . 5/10 for all those sober dogs ) . 

note : i have not read thompson's book . 

having said that , joblo did engage in an alcohol-based consumatory session before ( and during ) the viewing of this film , so his critique of the film should be appreciated on that level . 

this movie relies heavily on style and peculiar humour , rather than substance or plot . 

it moves admirably from one scene to the next , without much basis of their being , while presenting us with the two days in the life of writer hunter s . thompson during which he seemed to consume more drugs and alcohol than anyone could ever imagine . 

it was 1971 , and the times were apparently "" a' changing "" in the states . 

johnny depp chews into his role like an overgrown child sucking on a chocolate lollipop . 

during the filming , depp apparently become fast friends with real-life writer thompson , and was known to wander off the set from time to time , for the sake of checking out the newest barmaid at the local watering hole . 

i thought he did seem to exaggerate his walk a little bit too much , but then again , this movie is supposed to be a wild exaggeration of everything and anything , so who am i to talk . 

the one thing that did blow my mind was the actual physical transformation endured by actor benicio del toro for his role as dr . gonzo . 

i couldn't believe that this fat , samoan lawyer , was the same guy who played the slick mumbling criminal in the usual suspects ( 7 . 5/10 ) . 

word on the street is that gained over 40 pounds for this role , and i must say that his look was deliciously reprehensible . 

plenty of cameos also pepper this kaleidoscopic moving picture in the form of ellen barkin , christina ricci , tobey maguire and cameron diaz , along with a bunch of others . 

other than that , the soundtrack was expectedly eclectic , the style was not as wild as i thought it would be , and the ending was certainly not much of a barn-burner , but then again , who really noticed . 

this movie is about visions of bats floating through your head , johnny depp looking goofy and being bald , and the cornucopia of drug-ravaged scenes filling your own intoxicated system with ideas of anarchy , rebellion and the lost american dream . 

and for all those who plan on seeing this movie without the partnership of a mean drink or a mighty doobie , i suggest you move further down the aisle , buy yourself a ticket to godzilla ( 6/10 ) , and enjoy the visual fabrications manufactured for the unstimulated mind . 

little known facts : depp and del toro snorted plenty of powdered milk instead of cocaine . 

bill murray also portrayed a thompson-based character in the film where the buffalo roam . 

johnny depp turned down roles in the three musketeers , speed ( 7 . 5/10 ) , and legends of the fall ( 7 . 5/10 ) , for smaller and quirkier roles in benny and joon ( 6 . 5/10 ) and what's eating gilbert grape ? 

 ( 7/10 ) . 

in 1988 , depp told rolling stone magazine that he'd tried every drug by the age of 14 . 

johnny hung out with some of the members of oasis while filming the uncompleted divine rapture in ireland , and later played some slide guitar on the 1997 album , be here now . 

johnny was born in kentucky , is a high-school dropout , has nicknamed himself "" mr . stench "" , has been engaged to four women until now ( including actress winona ryder , whose "" winona forever "" tattoo had to be altered to "" wino forever "" after their breakup ) , currently plays guitar in a band called "" p "" , and owns the viper room nightclub in l . a .

"call "" hush "" "" stop or my mom will kill . "" 

or "" mommy fearest . "" 

or "" the hand that robs the cradle . "" 

call it whatever you want , but certainly don't see it unless you're in desperate need of a bad movie-induced chuckle -- "" hush "" scores so many unintentional guffaws that it almost qualifies as a guilty pleasure . 

chalk its losses up to frequent stupidity lapses and apparent post-production tinkering ( it was supposed to open about a year ago ) , the latter of which appears to have given "" hush "" a send-off that's downright infuriating . 

it's too bad that "" hush "" is so laughable , because the on-screen talent -- including the pairing of gwyneth paltrow and jessica lange -- is nothing to laugh at . 

paltrow and johnathon schaech play helen and jackson , a photogenic new york couple on their way to spend christmas vacation at his wealthy , well-to-do family's horse farm/estate kilronan . 

jackson's mother martha ( lange ) runs kilronan all by herself , and her genteel southern hospitality makes helen feel welcome immediately -- even if her first meeting with martha takes place while helen is in the altogether , caught red-handed after a bedroom romp with her husband-to-be . 

but it seems that martha's friendly smile masks a much more threatening demeanor ; she's what you'd call someone who loves too much . 

martha eagerly , deviously wants a grandchild , and then helen will be expendable , as far as she's concerned . 

if there's one reason to catch "" hush , "" it's lange . 

she treats the pedestrian screenplay better than it deserves to be treated , injecting martha ( poorly written though she may be ) with a little empathy to level out the psycho-playing field . 

when she delves into martha's dark side , predictable cliches -- chain-smoking , staring in mirrors , praying in a confessional to a priest who isn't there , poking a hole in helen's diaphragm so she'll become pregnant ( and she does ) -- abound , but it's moderately entertaining junk because lange is such an interesting actress to watch . 

veteran performer nina foch is smart and tart as jackson's wheelchair-bound paternal grandmother . 

the rest of the cast looks ill and uncomfortable , especially paltrow . 

but can you really blame them ? 

the character relationships in "" hush "" hold a certain amount of promise , at least until their psychological impact is blown out of the water by sheer stupidity . 

idiotic situations ( martha yells at a nearby horse so it will bolt up and knock helen over ) compliment idiotic dialogue ( "" why did you yell ? "" 

helen yells back at martha ) , and the film takes the form of one of the shoddier fill in the blank-from-hell flicks ever made . 

you can see through a great deal of martha's actions and lies from their conception ; why do people who have known this woman for years longer than we have never figure things out ? 

does nobody communicate or read the newspaper in this town ? 

if any of her potential victims thought , acted or behaved like normal people , "" hush "" would be a really short movie . 

and then there's the climax and ending , which abruptly come when helen starts having contractions after eating some pound cake spiked with a labor-inducing drug normally used on horses . 

after a really weird chase scene , martha calmly knits in a rocking chair while forcing helen to give birth in a bed all by herself . 

i won't spoil what happens next except to say that it's contradictory , illogical and ( probably , since i'm no doctor ) medically impossible . 

the final scene offers no closure , no resolution , no confrontation whatsoever . 

it's just there , dangling amidst silent displeasure . 

no one should like this ending , regardless of their feelings on the preceding material . 

perhaps "" hush "" 's title is a plea to silence its audience's likely bitter word of mouth while exiting the theater .

"these days , we are witnessing the deluge of films based on old , cult tv shows . 

most of the times , the fans of these shows shudder thinking what could hollywood hacks of the present do with the memories of their past . 

but , some five or six years ago , there weren't that many movies and the trend didn't look that depressing . 

so , the people who , like the author of this review , grew up watching flintstones , popular 1960s animated series about "" modern stone age "" family , weren't particularly worried when the word came about live action remake . 

after all , the producer behind the project was steven spielberg and , if anything else , at least the special effects would be good . 

the plot revolves about flintstones , family set in fictious stone age "" town "" of bedrock , whose members enjoy the lifestyle of 1950s middle class america . 

fred flinstone ( john goodman ) works in the quarry , and one day he helps his best friend and neighbour barney rubble ( rick moranis ) and his wife betty ( rosie o'donnell ) to adopt a baby . 

to return the favour , barney switches his results of aptitude test with fred , and , based on that , fred gets well-paid job in management . 

but , of course , this is just a sham - corrupt official cliff vandercave ( kyle maclachlan ) and his sultry secretary sharon stone ( halle berry ) need a scapegoat for their embezzlement scheme . 

in the meantime , fred's wife wilma ( elizabeth perkins ) must face her mother ( elizabeth taylor ) who can't stand fred . 

on the superficial level , the flintstones did the excellent job in bringing the animated series to life . 

computer effects are flawless , and the costumes , settings and other details are authentic for all the fans of the show . 

unfortunately , problems with this film start with inadequate casting - rick moranis is too thin for the role of barney , while the cartoon betty used to be much skinnier than rosie o'donnell . 

but the greatest problem of all is plot , or to be precise , the lack of plot . 

some thirty six screenwriters made sure that the plot of the film is lame , original characters one-dimensional , and many elements of the story , like embezzlement and inter-office politics , totally incomprehensible for the little children , the main targeted audience of this film . 

result is almost unwatchable mess , occasionally saved mostly by excellent acting ( elizabeth perkins was right on mark as wilma ) and one of the classic example of mortal hollywood disease known as "" high concept "" . 

after great hype , movie quickly sank into oblivion and the fans of the show returned to the animated version . 

all in all , film isn't that bad , but only the hard core fans and nostalgics can find more than guilty pleasure in it . 
"
"movies don't come much more ridiculously titled than "" i still know what you did last summer , "" but since the movie in question is best described as ridiculous , the title sort of works as a warning . 

more than a silly-sounding mouthful to blurt out to the ticket vendor , this horror sequel's moniker also contains a grievous oversight that anyone who saw the original will be able to spot : what "" you "" did _last_ summer "" you "" actually did the summer _before_ last summer , and since "" i "" knew about it _this_ summer as well as _last_ summer , it's really illogical to say that "" i "" _still_ know what "" you "" did _last_ summer . 

the filmmakers would have at least made sense with the shorter "" i still know , "" the longer "" i still know what you did two summers ago "" or the appropriate "" stupid people getting hacked to bits . "" 

that last suggestion is the preferable one since the characters in this film do things that are the polar opposite of smart . 

for example , if your roommate is plagued by terrible nightmares as a result of being stalked and nearly murdered not long ago , would you sneak into her room late at night and hide in the closet , even if it was just to locate and borrow a cute little dress ? 

probably not , but that's precisely what college student karla ( pop diva brandy ) does to best friend julie ( jennifer love hewitt ) , resulting in the first in a long line of phony frights . 

julie , you'll recall , was one of the sole survivors at the end of 1997's surprise hit "" i know what you did last summer , "" after a slasher with a grudge to bear - it's a _long_ story - began trying to pick off her , her buddies and various others in their coastal carolina village . 

in this installment , the plot picks up as karla wins a trip to the bahamas , and julie , yet racked by guilt , decides that maybe a tropical getaway will help ease her mind . 

yeah , right . 

their island paradise has room , of course , for one more in the form of the still-alive killer ( muse watson ) from the first film . 

he sports the same gorton's fisherman get-up , a heavy hat and rain slicker that mask his identity , but why he's still trying to stay anonymous is a mystery this movie never solves . . . 

though i suppose his hook-hand would look funny protruding from the sleeve of a leisure suit . 

in a sense , that's the movie's glaring flaw - everybody knows who the bad guy is , thus evaporating the level of paranoid tension nicely sustained by its prequel . 

the murders and attempted murders in that film were vivid and scary , but trey callaway's derivative "" i still know "" screenplay makes the fisherman just as dumb as his pretty potential victims . 

when julie lays blissfully unaware in a tanning bed , giving him a perfect chance to wreak vengeance once and for all , what does he do ? 

he twist-ties the lid shut and cranks up the uv rays - you'd think he'd want her gutted now instead of a skin cancer victim later . 

even prequel "" summer "" lovers might balk at how little there is here beyond sporadically amusing absurdity and a few neat-o shots of blood flowing from toned teenage flesh . 

the innovative gallows humor that scribe ( and "" scream "" wunderkind ) kevin williamson injected into "" i know "" 's unfolding story is sorely missed , replaced with the grating antics of a white rastafarian cabana boy who smokes weed and tosses off slang like "" yo "" ; you'll cheer - not shriek - when he ends up with a pair of hedgetrimmers firmly implanted in his chest . 

if "" i know what you did last summer , "" however effective , was just the kind of movie that those subversive "" scream "" flicks poked fun at , then the deadly "" i still know what you did last summer "" deserves a full-blown roasting on "" mystery science theatre 3000 . ""

"this film is based on the campy tv show from the 1960's under the same appellation . 

mind you , most people ( including yours truly ) who will see this movie will not have seen any episodes from the original series . 

the movie is really a stand alone in that regard . 

the family robinson . . . lost in space . 

plot : set in the year 2058 , the family robinson is chosen to sail out into space in search of other planets that might contain the natural resources earth needs in order to survive its future . 

a colonization process , if you will . 

they are joined by able pilot west ( leblanc ) , and evil uninvited stowaway ( oldman ) , who does not want to see the trip conclude on a successful tip . 

eventually , their trek goes awry , and all are "" lost in space "" . 

 "" how do get back to earth ? "" 

is the question that infests the rest of this sci-fi epic . 

critique : this film reminded me a lot of the fifth element ( 6 . 5/10 ) from the summer of 1997 . 

it's a film with a lot of flash , but very little actual substance . 

admittedly , there isn't an annoying character like chris tucker from the other film , but this film does run a little too long , and did lose me in regards to its complex time-travel / multi-dimensional story line . 

having said that , the special effects in this movie were amazing , and the overall look and feel were also way above average . 

you really felt like you were in the future , and riding through space with these poor souls . 

unfortunately for this chosen family , their 10-year old son is the smartest one in the group , and the father is too wrapped up in his work to notice the rest of his family ( ever heard that one before ? 

yawn ! ) . 

the acting is ok , and i was especially surprised at the solid performance by tv friend's matt leblanc who shows us all that he's definitely more than just a pretty face . 

on the down side , the family riff-raff that cuts through most of the picture is lame and time-consuming ( even though we gotta give them credit for "" trying "" to develop characters in a sci-fi pic ) , the story line is hard to follow , the evil character in the movie actually tells people that he's "" evil "" , and the movie goes on for about 20 minutes too long . 

on the slick side , many of the special effects are really cool ( the sequence in which the family is "" paralyzed "" during the hyper-drive is awesome , and the animated monkey that joins the family halfway through the flic is mucho cool ) , the credit presentation at the end of the film is slamming , and the adventures that they fall into are somewhat thrilling ( i will also admit that "" somehow "" they got me to semi-tear up near the conclusion of this picture . . . . very 

odd . . . . . ) . 

overall , if you're a big sci-fi fan , check this movie out for the special effects and challenging narrative , and if you're not , i would still suggest seeing this movie , but then you could probably wait until it comes out on video so that you forward past some of the boring parts . 

little known facts : this film will always be remembered as the movie that knocked titanic ( 7/10 ) out of the top spot at the box-office after 15 straight weeks at number one . 

garry oldman is british , and was once married to uma thurman for about six months . 

mimi rogers was tom cruise's first wife .

"in life , eddie murphy and martin lawrence play two young men wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison . 

after about an hour of watching this movie , you begin to realize how their characters feel . 

fortunately , for audience members there's a chance to escape the nearest exit . 

this , undoubtedly , is eddie murphy's worst movie and that's an accomplishment . 

remember the golden child , harlem nights ? 

compared to life , they look like citizen kane . 

life is long , predictable , foul-mouthed and only intermittently funny . 

its 100-minute running time feels like 100 years . 

robert ramsey and matthew stone's script basically consist of murphy and lawrence referring to everyone around them as "" motherf . . . s "" or "" n . . . . . 

s . "" 

you lose count how many times both those obnoxious , offensive words are used . 

and if that all it takes to write a script , than any illiterate jackass can sit at a word processor and compose a movie . 

but , like life , it will probably stink . 

to be honest , the screening audience surrounding me in the theater yucked it up . 

but these were the same people who howled at all the flatulence and fat jokes as well . 

life is as sophisticated as a belch . 

it's crude and stereotypical . 

years ago , movies stereotypically portrayed blacks subservient , second-class people , good for being only maids and servants . 

for the most part , the lot of blacks and other racial groups have improved . 

but a new , more insidious stereotype is creeping into movies . 

in many recent films , through actors such as murphy and chris tuckers , blacks are presented as fast-talking , conniving , scam artists or hip-hop , gun-crazy , sex-crazed youths . 

both sets of caricatures are demeaning . 

and the fault does not rest with the actors . 

they have to eat , too . 

it is with the people who write the scripts , the studios who green-light the projects and the audiences who accept these portrayals without protest . 

life's only redeeming virtue is the artistry of makeup legend rick baker who flawlessly ages murphy and lawrence into 90 year olds . 

otherwise , life is an embarrassment , a blot on the resumes of those associated with it . 

see it at your own risk .

" "" a private matter "" is based on the true story of sherri finkbine and the events in her life during the 1960s . 

after becoming pregnant ( for the fifth time ) she learns that some tranquilizers she had taken have seriously deformed her unborn child . 

she and her husband decide , with the help of her doctor , to have an abortion . 

but this is the 1960s , and abortion is illegal . 

her doctor has made arrangements to have the procedure performed withing the law , by claiming that the child is endangering the mother's life . 

everything is about to work out just fine , until sherri has the uncontrollable urge to talk about her situation with a local reporter . 

this sets off a media frenzy and immediately sherri is the most hated woman in the world . 

she and her husband are fired from their jobs , reporters are surrounding their home at all times , and most importantly , no one in the country ( and eventually other countries ) will perform the abortion . 

this causes emotion problems for all involved . 

 "" a private matter "" is a fascinating story and it's hard to believe that this only happened 30 years or so ago . 

it's only flaw is that not once is there ever a satisfactory confrontation with sherri and any of her opponents . 

one woman passing her on the street telss her to burn in hell , and when sherri appropriately yells back , "" just tell me what i'm supposed to do , "" the woman has no answer . 

no one apparently had an answer , they just wanted to control what should have been only the choice of sherri and her husband . 

this is an important film , telling an important story . 

it's not just about not wanting another child , it's about not wanting a child who will cause severe changes in their family , none of which could be beneficial .

this is just the setup , and i don't want to give too much away , because a large part of the movies fun is the surprises . 

charlie sheen , who has had a rocky career as of late , is in top form here . 

he is funny , serious , and determined to accomplish his goal . 

sheen's absolutely terrific performance is another big plus to this movie . 

the story is ingeniously devised by twohy , who also wrote and directed the equally clever cable movie grand tour : disaster in time . 

the films major flaw is a very slow pace , and not much happens in the earlygoings . 

viewers may be growing restless for a while , but trust me if you stick around and keep your head in it , you will have a good time .

10 things i hate about you is an update of the classic play , the taming of the shrew . 

that said , drop any pre-conceived notions of what shakespeare's work is supposed to be like and welcome yourself to padua high school , home of a student counselor ( allison janney ) who obsesses over the male penis ; a slightly too hip and racist african-american english teacher ( daryl mitchell ) ; a new kid named cameron ( joseph gordon-levitt ) ; a model named joey ( andrew keegan ) , the subject of cameron and joey's crushes ; bianca ( larisa oleynik ) ; and bianca's sister - the shrew ( julia stiles in a marvelous performance ) - whose name is katarina , kat for short . 

with movies about high schools similar to these running through projectors like water down the nile , it would be quite easy to write off 10 things i hate about you as just another doltish comedic-romance . 

yet , you must realize that the story is timeless , and a few hundred years later it is equally as witty and comical as when elizabeth gleefully looked on , groundlings below and stuffed brassieres on stage . 

the first reminder of the original scribe can be found in katarina and bianca's last name : stratford . 

their family is run by walter stratford ( pretty woman's larry miller ) , a doctor who is all too familiar with teenage pregnancy and guards his children accordingly . 

in what he thinks to be a moment of ironic humor , the family "" no dating "" policy is amended to "" bianca can date . . . when 

[katarina] does . "" 

with prom just ahead , bianca's fate is grim ; unless , of course , she can tame the shrew . 

don't think this mission to be a simple one , as bianca kindly points out , her sister "" . . . is a particularly hideous breed of loser . "" 

getting katarina to date is complex and oftentimes confusing . 

when cameron , who likes bianca , learns of her father's new rule , he is quick to consult a friend for advice . 

the scheme they dream up is to fully exploit "" someone with money . "" 

in this case , that is joey - the other guy with a crush on bianca . 

cameron's friend , a loser by teenage verdict , convinces joey to pay someone who has enough guts to take the shrew out . 

the solution lies no farther away than the second blatant reminder of the master scribe : patrick verona ( heath ledger ) . 

this verona is far from fair ; rumor has it that he previously laid his scene in prison . 

moreover , katarina openly opined to the aforementioned english teacher that "" hemingway was an alcoholic who hung around picasso , hoping to nail his leftovers . "" 

the laws of high school cinema inexorably turn patrick and katarina into romeo and juliet . 

providing a constant reminder of the fact that this isn't exactly what shakespeare had in mind are the elements obligatory to a high school comedy : a party polluted with liquor , a best friend's betrayal , and prom . 

it is the latter that has become infamous for closing films like drive me crazy , american pie , never been kissed , carrie , she's all that , and can't hardly wait . 

yet surely even these practices have roots in shakespeare ; falstaff was a drunk , romeo and juliet met at a party , and caesar learned about loyalty the hard way .

"clue is an unfairly ignored comedy , very similar to 1976's murder by death . 

this big screen version of the classic board game ( what's next . . . 

chutes and ladders : the motion picture ? ) is filled with slapstick antics and silly dialogue . 

the plot , for what it's worth , has all the characters from the game ( in this case , the names from the game are used as aliases ) meeting in an isolated mansion to confront mr . boddy ( lee ving ) , the man who's been blackmailing them all . 

when he turns up dead , everyone ( including the audience ) must figure out whodunnit . . . 

and in what room , and with what object . 

while not as witty as neil simon's murder by death , clue definitely has it moments . 

it has so many moments in fact that i use a lot of the lines from the film when i'm joking around with my friends . 

to this day , whenever someone says the phrase "" well , to make a long story short "" i have the follow up phrase "" too late "" ready to go . 

the cast ( all very good comedic talents ) play well off one another , while the late madeline kahn ( as the dark and sultry mrs . white ) sometimes steals the film away from the rest . 

and colleen camp , as the french maid yvette , displays some of her natural talents as well . 

clue is available on dvd from paramount home video . 

it includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) and features the original theatrical trailer . 

a french language audio track is also available . 

the trailer holds up well considering most previews from that time do not , and it even includes a scene not in the film itself ( a scene that should have been in the film , as it's a good joke ) . 

also , the trailer is scored to the music from airplane ! , which was an interesting choice . 

when clue played in theaters , it ran with the gimmick of three different endings . 

if you wanted to see all three , you had to go to the movies three separate times . 

so when the film was released on home video , rather than releasing three separate videos , all three endings were included on one tape . . . 

the first two endings being "" what if ? "" 

endings and the third ending being the actual ending . 

now for the dvd release you get two choices . 

you can watch the film as it was presented on home video or you can select to watch it with one of the three endings randomly chosen for you . 

 ( note : there's an easter egg hidden in the disc pertaining to this . 

after watching the film with a randomly selected ending , when you return to the menu screen you will be able to highlight the large magnifying glass and select it . 

when you do , a secret menu opens , allowing you to watch any of the three endings by themselves . ) 

now while i applaud the effort of paramount here , as they clearly tried to do something special with the disc , it just doesn't work well . 

first , why not give the viewer the choice of what ending we want to watch ? 

maybe someone like myself who's seen the movie hundreds of times would like to sit down and show it to someone with the second ending only . 

i'm no technical dvd expert , but i can't imagine that being too hard to accomplish . 

secondly , the delay between when the film itself ends and one of the endings begins is too long and too obvious , thereby becoming a distraction right when you definitely don't need a distraction . 

finally , the back of the dvd case states "" and now , with this special dvd version , you can see all 3 surprise endings "" . 

i have no idea why they would word it that way , since that's not a special feature in the slightest . 

the video has been out for fifteen years now ( good lord , has it been that long ? ) and it's played on television with all three endings all the time . 

these are merely minor complaints however , seeing that i've watched the home video version hundreds of times and have no problem watching the film as such on the dvd . 

the picture and sound are wonderfully improved over my worn out vhs copy , and i'm thrilled that paramount agrees with me that clue is a film worthy of being preserved on this great digital format .

"some talented actresses are blessed with a demonstrated wide acting range while others , almost as gifted , have more limited types of parts for which they are suitable . 

as was amply evident after basic instinct , sharon stone can play sensual roles with great abandon . 

rejecting her natural abilities , she has spent the rest of her entire career trying with little success to play against type . 

gloria is her latest disaster . 

babe ruth didn't quit baseball after one season to play football in a quixotic quest to prove his athletic dexterity , and neither should stone reject what she does best . 

janeane garofalo , for example , is no less wonderful an actress because she could have never pulled off stone's part in basic instinct ; neither is stone any less talented because she couldn't do garofalo's comedic roles . 

gloria , directed by respected director sidney lumet and adapted by steve antin from the 1980 screenplay by john cassavetes , was not screened in advance for critics , almost always a sign that the studio isn't behind the picture . 

after seeing it in a nearly empty audience after it opened , it is clear why they held it from the press . 

it is a film more to be endured than enjoyed . 

as the story opens , an angry gloria ( stone ) is being released from prison after 3 years confinement . 

she's got a bad attitude and a big mouth . 

she also has a bad case of wavering and overblown new york accents , a disease suffered by much of the rest of the cast . 

an annoying child actor named jean-luke figueroa plays a soon-to-be orphan named nicky . 

just before his whole family is gunned down by hoods working for gloria's ex-boyfriend kevin ( jeremy northam ) , nicky's dad gives him a banana yellow floppy disk with secrets about kevin's operation and offers him a piece of fatherly advice . 

 "" be a man , "" his father lectures him sternly . 

 "" don't trust nobody . 

not no broads . 

nobody . "" 

most of the film's leaden dialog is delivered with the emotive power of the automated time and temperature announcements . 

add in the movie's almost non-existent background noise and the excruciatingly slow pacing , and you can hear the sounds of the lines falling to the ground like stones . 

lumet places his actors in the frames like fruit in a still life painting . 

they stand awkwardly mouthing the stiff sentences that pass for discourse . 

 ( "" say you're my baby , "" kevin coos demandingly . 

 "" i'm not gonna , "" gloria pouts back . ) 

the movie has a plethora of logical flaws and implausibilites . 

the kid rarely seems the least bit worried or scared , no matter how many people are after him with guns , trying to kill him . 

and in one key scene , the yellow floppy he holds is assumed to be the right disk without checking it and is further assumed never to have been copied . 

gloria , who keeps saying how she hates kids , takes nicky under her wing and protects him from kevin and the bad guys . 

think her maternal instincts will show up before the movie finally and predictably ends ? 

if you don't know the answer , you may be just the right viewer for this film . 

you have to say this for stone : she can keep a straight face . 

when explaining life to a 7-year-old kid , she says with utter seriousness , "" you got a lot of love making to make ; you got a lot of boozing to do . "" 

gloria runs 1 : 48 . 

it is rated r for profanity , violence and brief male nudity and would be acceptable for teenagers . 
"
"the verdict : spine-chilling drama from horror maestro stephen king , featuring an outstanding , oscar-winning performance from kathy bates . 

geez , french and saunders had a field day when they set to work on parodying this ! 

sorry , non-british readers may not be familiar with french and saunders - my apologies . 

the pair are british comediennes ( jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in "" absolutely fabulous "" ) , who did a series of film spoofs a few years back , including alien , the exorcist and misery . 

needless to say , amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates ( the resemblance was quite uncanny ! ) , dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunder's legs ! 

but despite the lingering memory of their sketch , and although i've now seen the film a couple of times now , that "" hobbling "" scene was no less disturbing ! 

i'm still left screaming at the telly in revulsion ! 

that may be the most memorable scene , but it's certainly not the only worth watching . 

stephen king , whose film and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality , strikes gold with this simple yet strikingly compelling tale . 

it's a nicely crafted psychological horror , which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon ( james caan ) . 

rescued from a car accident by annie wilkes ( bates ) , who introduces herself as the writer's "" number one fan "" , he soon becomes her prisoner . 

both the script and kathy bates' beautifully masterful performance ( for which she won an oscar ) work arm-in-arm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as a fruit-cake ( or is that fruity as a nut-cake ? ) . 

bates relishes her demanding role , and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece . 

at times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour , at times she's a rather tragic character , and more often than not she's just damned scary ! 

this is basically a very simple tale , but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity . 

it's an involving , engrossing experience - and considering it's basically a two-hander , mainly set in one locale , it's a remarkable piece of cinema . 

there are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences - this one relies solely upon rob reiner's stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan . 

oh , i haven't really mentioned caan yet - he does a good job as the writer who's a prisoner of his own success ( annie is obsessed with him and his books ) . 

but , as you no doubt gathered from the above - bates is well and truly the star of the show . 

along with the pig , of course ! 

anyway , the tension is built-up with masterful aplomb , and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense . 

there's the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve-shattering lengths to poison her wine . 

he succeeds , but . . . she 

knocks the glass over ! 

i bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well ! 

in the immortal words of homer j . simpson - "" d'oh ! ! "" 

other nerve-wracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house . 

we cut to annie in her car - she's on her way home . . . he 

realises this and tries to get back to his room . . . cut 

to the car again , she's getting near . . . will he make it ? 

ok , so these sequences aren't exactly original , nor perhaps unpredictable - but they work ! 

boy , do they work ! 

if a film has you on the edge of your couch , biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense , then it's doing something right ! 

of course , the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned "" hobbling "" ! 

annie realises her captive has been out of his room , and she's going to stop him once and for all . 

cue a block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and a huge sledgehammer , and . . . i feel ill just thinking about it ! 

nasty . 

it all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand , and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho ! 

and then we're given one of the most ridiculously over-the-top fight scenes i've ever seen . 

she gets hit over the head with a typewriter , set on fire , head smashed against the wall - and she just won't die ! 

sheldon isn't in terribly good shape either . 

if it weren't so gorey it would almost be laughable . 

but it's a terrifically effective film , and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked . 

misery is a tight , tense , intense and chillingly entertaining thriller . 

the directing is first-rate , and the performances - bates in particular - contribute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gem . 

wonderful stuff .

"while watching "" shallow grave , "" i found myself periodically noticing thematic similarities to the coens' "" blood simple . "" 

both are good films in which several characters , none of whom are the most conscientious to have walked the earth but still are not really evil , indulge in an act of deception that soon necessitates more serious crimes . 

the body count rises , and before long seemingly normal people have blood on their hands . 

both films are also flawed , but for different reasons . 

 "" blood simple "" is unrelentingly dark and moody , but its characterizations were a little hollow . 

 "" shallow grave , "" on the other hand , is nearly flawless for an hour and twenty minutes , and then the filmmakers throw away much of what they'd accomplished for a more standard , audience-pleasing ending . 

the events of the film were sufficiently intense and disturbing that i honestly felt quite troubled by what i was witnessing on screen most of the time , yet there was a slight grin on my face at the end . 

as the film begins , we are introduced to alex ( ewan mcgregor ) , juliet ( kerry fox ) , and david ( christopher eccleston ) , a scottish trio living in an apartment in glasgow . 

they are all sarcastic and occasionally obnoxious , but other than that they seem like a fairly normal bunch . 

a man named hugo moves into the apartment's remaining vacancy , and the next morning he is found dead of a drug overdose . 

juliet is about to call the police when alex discovers that hugo had brought with him a suitcase filled to the brim with cash ( presumably from criminal activities ) . 

the three eventually decide to keep the money and cover up the death ; after a drawing of straws , the particularly unenviable task of mutilating the body so as to make it unidentifiable and burying it falls to david , who had been the most reluctant to partake in the scheme from the beginning . 

all of this transpires in the first twenty minutes or so of the film , and part of what makes "" shallow grave "" so brilliant for a while is that i honestly had no idea what was coming next . 

other than the obvious question of why they don't report the death and simply hide the cash , which is not addressed , the plotting and characterization , while sometimes predictable , worked in a way that kept my attention and , on more than one occasion , gave me chills . 

i will , therefore , attempt to continue this review in a way that doesn't give away too much of the plot . 

broadly , the trio are in danger due to hugo's underworld connections , as two goons search for the money and kill several people in the process . 

a police inspector ( ken stott ) is clearly suspicious and visits the apartment , asking pointed questions and trying to unnerve the three suspects by exchanging banal and weirdly humorous bits of dialogue with a junior detective . 

david , meanwhile , becomes increasingly paranoid , moves into the attic , and develops an affinity for sharp objects . 

director danny boyle effectively creates an atmosphere of mounting tension and suspicion in the apartment , and finally the three seem ready to turn against each other . 

while i do not consider myself the "" happy endings are automatically stupid "" type , i thought that "" shallow grave "" really should have ended in tragedy - a realistic analysis of the story up to the last ten minutes of the film would indicate that all three characters were probably about to end up in prison , in the mental hospital , or in the morgue . 

this could have been accomplished , quite credibly , but then boyle and screenwriter john hodge seem to flinch and opt for a more conventional "" caper "" ending in which we get a kick out of seeing who outsmarted whom , and nothing more . 

granted , this isn't really a "" happy "" ending , but it's still pretty light-hearted compared to what preceded it . 

i really shouldn't say anything more about the ending as far as details go , but let me add that it seemed not only shallow and lazy but also inconsistent with the rest of the film and not very believable . 

yes , this ending made me crack a smile for a couple of minutes , but ultimately it left me feeling as if i'd been cheated . 

still , "" shallow grave "" was brilliant most of the way through , and it does at least meet the minimum requirements for an entertaining thriller , and i am therefore awarding it three stars . 

i guess i just can't help but think about that fourth star that boyle and hodge let slip away . 
"
"there's only one presidential election every four years , but it seems like every few months we get another presidential conspiracy movie painted as _the_ thriller of the year . 

in 1997 , we've had absolute power , air force one , shadow conspiracy and murder at 1600 . 

this one is about as lame duck as old gerald ford , trying to bring us a complex plot of cover-up and intrigue but copping out over and over again with rehashes of action flick standbys . 

here's what happens this time . 

it's night at the white house . 

a secretary is having sex with some unidentified guy with a cute butt . 

the next day she's dead and hotshot detective wesley snipes is called in . 

how do we know he's a hotshot ? 

we've seen the traditional action flick opener -- the clever hostage negotiation scene . 

it's not so clever this time , consisting of snipes disarming a suicidal ex-government employee holding a gun to his head in the middle of the street . 

snipes is off to the white house , where he finds the secret service head ( the shiny bald head of daniel benzali ) won't cooperate with him at all . 

in fact , if not for the intervention of national security adviser alan alda , snipes wouldn't have been allowed in the white house at all . 

alda helps snipes out further , assigning a sexy secret service agent ( diane lane ) to act as his liaison . . . 

a very dangerous liaison . 

well , not really , i just wanted to say that . 

almost immediately , a suspect is found , an eccentric night janitor seen flirting with the deceased on one of the security videos . 

snipes doesn't buy it , and launches into an independent investigation of his own , one that reveals planted evidence and romantic involvement by the president's son . 

snipes' partner , an always- wisecracking dennis miller , calls him up every once in awhile with more news and lane , who at first doesn't believe snipes , eventually and predictably comes around , and risks her ass to break into social security storage and break out some classified information . 

for the first hour or so , murder at 1600 looks like it could be going somewhere interesting . 

sure , we have to sit through the lame opening sequence and plenty more lame scenes after that , but the whole murder in the white house thing makes for an interesting premise that is never quite delivered upon . 

snipes and lane don't make for a bad action team , but with nothing to work with , they're just cogs in the bad movie machine . 

dennis miller might as well not even be in the movie ; they waste his talents more in murder at 1600 than they did in bordello of blood , and that's saying a lot . 

when you get to the last half-hour , the movie has descended metaphorically and literally into a wet sewer , busting out the old break-into-the-building underground climax . 

and when they finally reveal who killed the woman and why , you'll wish you never sat through this movie at all . 

the "" 1600 "" in the movie's title doesn't represent an address , it represents the number of satisfied customers worldwide . 

serving the world for nearly 1/25th of a century !

"my son and i share a perverse predilection for bad movies . 

we are amused and entertained by the cheap thrills , the corny dialog , the ludicrous premises and the bad acting . 

since other family members aspire to higher forms of entertainment , we usually wind up indulging our proclivity together . 

i can't remember when we disagreed on the relative merits of a clunker until species 2 came along . 

he was not amused . 

i on the other hand was able to easily suspend the applicable requirements in the usual manner and declare myself suitably entertained . 

perhaps the evident skills that were brought to the process of producing a bad product was what prevented him from extracting fun out of mediocrity . 

i on the other hand appreciated the fact that the producers and director knew exactly what they were doing : insulting my intelligence , and brought adequate movie-making skills to the project a movie does not have to be good to be well made , at least in terms of the craft . 

the movie could have been better if it were not so brusque . 

this movie slaps you with conception , pregnancy , delivery and young childhood in consecutive frames , without pausing for infancy . 

the producers of nescafe have nothing on this alien race in which a woman's womb balloons immediately after the male orgasm , and a few seconds later a young child tears its way out of her abdomen in a sloppy and gory version of an inside-out cesarean . 

an autopsy scene in which a buzz saw cuts through the cranium was not the kind of indulgence that i condone , to say nothing of the fact that it was scientifically incorrect . 

in a real autopsy the saw does not cut through the scalp ; it is used only after the skull has been exposed . 

the opening sequences of exploration of mars were very good . 

the writers showed excellent skills for ceremonial speech writing but the spontaneous dialogue would qualify for a subtitle : `as bad as it gets' . 

as the movie progressed i vowed to remember the lines that made me cringe but only one stuck . 

eve ( natasha henstridge ) was cloned from sil , the original alien sexual predator , but her mating instinct was artificially attenuated , which was all that was needed to turn her into a noble and cooperative prisoner . 

in a wistful display of resignation and understanding she tells her friend and jailer ( marg helgenberger ) : `i think of all the places that i will never see and all the people that i will never meet . ' 

it's enough to melt the most callous heart . 

at another point she protests : `i'm human too , you know . ' 

she is only half right . 

peter medak , the director , knows his business . 

justin lazard as the doomed astronaut does nothing to enhance his hollywood credentials . 

james cromwell , his father , is perfect in a short role . 

marg heldenberger , the dna scientist is pleasant and beautiful . 

natasha is an exquisite ornament . 

george dzunza knew and delivered what was expected of him as the dumb general that messes things up . 

michael madsen was there . 

black buddies do not usually survive in this type of movie but mykelti williamson manages to stay around for the final credits , which is more that we can say for lazard . . 
"
"well i'll be damned , what a most excellent surprise . 

not to be confused with the campy and far inferior 1988 remake starring ex-porn star traci lords , this more recent attempt at remaking the 1950's drive-in schlockfest not of this earth is a real gem and was quite possibly the best sci-fi flick of 1995 . 

once again , b-movie king roger corman is behind this effort ( he directed the original ) but this time he appears only in the role of executive producer . 

the rest of the crew and cast are relative unknowns . 

it seems criminal that the film was released direct to video in most countries , because it's an absolute must-see for sci-fi fans and a treat for anyone who enjoys decently acted and written thrillers with a kooky bent . 

the plot in brief . 

paul johnson ( michael york ) is an alien posing as an eccentric millionaire who , though needing to kill people to live , is visiting earth for far from selfish reasons . 

his race is dying of a mysterious blood disease and he desperately is trying to find a cure , the key of which lies in the blood of humans . 

he visits and soon puts under his spell the respected blood physician dr . rochelle , whom he hypnotises into doing secret research on his behalf . 

he also has the doctor convince smart and sexy nurse amanda ( elizabeth barondes ) to move in with johnson as his private nurse so as to give him the blood transfusions which he constantly requires . 

but before long , amanda and johnson's sleazy chauffeur release that johnson is a lot more than just eccentric . 

i must admit , my first glimpse of the video cover for not of this earth was not encouraging . 

british actor michael york has appeared in some real stinkers in past few decades , a far cry from the quality fare of his younger days such as caberat ( 1972 ) . 

but his performance here as an alien in human disguise is nothing short of outstanding . 

the weird twitches and bizarre modes of speech , the dapper clothes and cool spectacles , the unexpected pathos which he invests in his character . 

york is by turns hilarious , menacing and tragic . 

this is a tour-de-force and quite simply the best performance i've seen from him . 

and while obviously made on a modest budget , the film boasts enormous strengths . 

the casting is spot on , the acting is terrific and the script is intelligent , witty and consistently engaging , cleverly updating the original . 

the balance of horror and humour is just about perfect , a marked contrast to the earlier remake from 1988 . 

the film doesn't drag for a second of its 90 minute running time thanks to tight editing and the sure hand of little-known director terrance h . winkless . 

and it doesn't matter one bit that the special effects are cheesy - this is schlock after all , even if it is high class schlock . 

in fact my only criticism of the film is that things get a tad weak towards the end . 

tighter direction could have given the climax more urgency and a few of the characters act rather illogically given their life-threatening situation . 

but these are minor complaints . 

just see it . 

not of this earth is one of the biggest sci-fi surprises in years . 

and michael york : in one cool swoop you've made yourself a b-movie legend , dude . 
"
"jackie brown entered theaters with little fanfare and a lot of expectation . 

even though advance publicity on this one was fairly limited , the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation . 

this is , after all , the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction . 

to say he has been inactive in between would be to tell a falsehood , since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio , desperado , four rooms , and from dusk 'til dawn . 

he was also called in at the last minute to help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide . 

 ( i'm willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him . ) 

tarantino contributed on and off screen to these films , but never took the director's helm . 

nearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta a star once more , tarantino returns with a film he can call his own . 

the film opens up with an homage to the graduate , with jackie brown ( pam grier ) on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her . 

jackie is a flight attendant for air cabo , which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas . 

this makes jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi ( samuel l . jackson ) who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico . 

however , while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the u . s . for ordell , jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus ( michael bowen ) and atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , who catch her not only with the money , but with a bonus of a couple of ounces of illicit drugs . 

jackie didn't know they were in the package with the cash , but that's of no consequence to the authorities , who threaten jackie with a couple of years hard time if convicted . 

of course , dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish , ordell . 

ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) to get jackie out of jail , but while max is immediately attracted to her , jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety , since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police . 

sure enough , ordell shows up at jackie's apartment that evening and tries to silence jackie for good , but she "" borrows "" max's pistol and manages to turn the tables on ordell . 

instead of closing the irony circle and relocating a bullet from the pistol's chamber to ordell's head , jackie proposes a deal . 

since ordell wants to get his money out of mexico , jackie will get back up to her old tricks and be a courier for him once more , but this time for a more substantial fee : fifteen percent of ordell's half million dollars . 

with a gun in his face , how can ordell not agree ? 

by itself , this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film . 

however , we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think . 

jackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell , but she's also making a deal with the feds as well as with max . 

the film throws us off every once in a while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually a sham , but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around . 

instead , it's actually a nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of today's movies . 

at least this film has a little imagination . 

most of the performances in jackie brown are above par . 

pam grier , of whom i had never taken notice before , plays jackie with a mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable . 

samuel l . jackson has a kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control . 

robert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy , trying to do his best . . 

never mind that he belongs to a profession where sneaking into a guy's apartment to zap him with a stun gun is simply a matter of course . 

he's just so down-to-earth , the nature of his job really doesn't occur to us , even when we're shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison , or when we see the tools of his trade . 

in supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara , a recently paroled friend of ordell's , and bridget fonda as melanie , one of the girls ordell keeps around town . 

unfortunately , de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few and far between , and then they are mostly clipped sentences . 

in this film , he's not really de niro , but stereotypical de niro , uttering things like , "" little bit , "" and "" pretty much . "" 

fonda , on the other hand , plays the slightly spaced-out melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness , such that even when she is annoying louis , we are taking her side . 

as is characteristic of any film in which tarantino has had a hand , the dialog is quick and snappy . 

it grabs our attention and is actually interesting , and in many respects , this makes jackie brown a film which needs few visuals ; the lines are a form of art in and amongst themselves . 

don't count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera , however . 

there's a scene where max is unwittingly watching a dry run of a money exchange , and he's not really sure what's happening , but by composing the scene just so , his realization of what's going on is felt simultaneously by the audience . 

we look at the screen and think , "" gee , that's clever , "" and then think the same thing about how the film induced us into that wonderful feeling of catching on . 

although tarantino isn't afraid to drag out a shot for dramatic effect , it unfortunately works to varying degrees in this film . 

there are shots where a character is simply driving , and we watch this person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head . 

this is a tribute to both direction and acting . 

however , there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through a mall , and she is looking for something ; desperately looking for something . 

we get the idea of the frantic nature of her search , but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what she's looking for , but instead hoping she'll just stop . 

overall , viewing jackie brown is time spent well . 

some flap has already been made about the language used in the film , but it's really not much worse than many of the other movies out there today . 

in fact , one might even be able to say that the way in which these "" offensive "" words are employed almost cause them to parody themselves and therefore transcend their own offensiveness . 

go see the film and see what i mean .

"my giant is two movies for the price of one , but neither is worth the cost of admission , even if you get in free . 

as lamely directed by michael lehmann , the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book . 

 ( "" without goliath , david is just some punk throwing rocks . "" ) 

languidly paced throughout , the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer ( the omen ) meanders toward its sad ending . 

since it's rarely funny or convincingly dramatic , what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery . 

other than a few nice visuals , there's nothing to recommend the picture . 

with great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally ? to the original city slickers , billy crystal has shown that he's more than the world's best oscar host . 

he does , however , have a propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last year's father's day and this year's my giant . 

one wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project . 

surely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there . 

perhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success . 

or maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movie's somber tone . 

the most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day . 

this one-joke movie's single idea is to place real-life basketball player gheorghe muresan , who stands seven and a half feet tall , into as many visually striking situations as possible . 

sammy ( crystal ) , an agent currently without clients , is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max ( muresan ) . 

after throwing out constant one-liners ( "" either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car . "" ) , 

sammy decides to get serious , seeing max as his meal ticket . 

and although he doesn't like it , he's willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a half-dozen dwarfs . 

 ( the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever . ) 

after a series of missed opportunities , the comedic part of the movie is over , and it turns into a cheap and maudlin disease movie . 

we learn that max's condition is terminal , and he will soon die . 

to be fair , the movie does contain a few good scenes - all of which you can see in the trailers . 

let's hope billy gets himself a pair of reading glasses before he signs up for another movie . 

my giant runs too long even at just 1 : 37 . 

it is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up . 

my son jeffrey and his friend matthew , both 9 , gave the movie a single star and had nothing good to say about it . 

matthew pointed out that it "" is not as good as it could have been or should have been . "" 

 ( amen . ) 

he went on to comment that he did not like the way the movie changed completely in the middle . 

jeffrey complained particularly about how gross the movie was .

"a remake of the 1978 warren beatty vehicle "" heaven can wait "" ( which in turn was a remake of "" here comes mr . jordan "" ) , "" down to earth "" tells the tale of lance barton ( chris rock , "" lethal weapon iv "" ) , a young black standup comic trying to win over the audience at harlem's apollo theater . 

when he's taken to heaven prematurely by bumbling angel keyes ( eugene levy , "" best in show "" ) , his only recourse is to return in another body . 

he chooses that of charles wellington , the tenth richest man in the united states . 

of course , wellington is not only rich , but white and 53 years old , which makes lance's bid for closing night at the apollo , as well as his desire to woo suntee ( regina taylor , "" jerry maguire "" ) , a tad tricky . 

the original elaine may/warren beatty script has been reworked by chris rock , lance crouther , ali leroi , and louis c . k . 

to turn beatty's vehicle as a football player into rock's vehicle as a comic and add some racial humor . 

as directed by chris weitz and paul weitz ( codirectors of "" american pie "" and costars of "" chuck & buck "" ) , the whole affair comes off as amateur hour . 

initial scenes play like filmed line reading rehearsals . 

production values are shoddy . 

most serious of all is the use of rock when his wellington counterpart would have been more appropriate . 

this problem is clearly attributable to the fact that the old white guy is never lip or action synched when he is on screen . 

rock does get the chance to do some fun schtick , such as his turnaround on wellington's plans for a poor neighborhood hospital ( 'bullet in the head ? 

you got a bed ! ' ) , but he's uneven when interacting with the rest of the cast . 

regina taylor fares well amidst the mediocrity as the young activist who confusedly ends up falling for the man she believed to be her nemesis . 

also good is frankie faison ( "" hannibal "" ) as whitney , lance's compassionate manager - the only human who's made privy to lance's body body switch . 

chaz palminteri and levy are pretty much wasted as heaven's ambassadors . 

another "" best in show "" alumnus , jennifer coolidge , is poorly used as wellington's cheating wife ( and shown several days apart wearing the same outfit ? ! ) and greg germann ( tv's "" ally mcbeal , "" "" sweet november "" ) continues display his sitcom roots as her lover and husband's lawyer . 

mark addy ( "" the full monty "" ) is sorely underutilized as cisco , wellington's fake english butler . 

stealing the show in every scene she's in is wanda sykes ( "" the chris rock show "" ) as wellington's disgruntled maid . 

 "" down to earth "" is for chris rock fans only . 

all others should go rent "" heaven can wait "" or truly be brought down to earth .

"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . 

be forewarned . 

east meets west in mulan , the latest installment in disney's parade of annual animated feature films . 

an odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious mass-market commercial sensibilities , this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years , but falls short of actualizing its potential . 

though not for lack of trying . 

in many respects , mulan is among disney's most mature efforts , skirting the surface of adult themes and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat . 

the violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized -- the imagery of a pillaged village , neatly encapsulated in the form of a child's discarded doll , is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars , and mulan's later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy , bloodless method imaginable -- yet how often does a hollywood animated film , long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent , dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner ? 

in an instant , idealistic mulan's innocence is lost , and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their efforts are spent defending . 

the film , based upon an ancient chinese fable , centers on a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to serve as her family's obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns ( cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones , replete with glowing yellow eyes and dagger-edged teeth , although lent a surprisingly genuine sense of menace ) . 

dipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western / european fables and literature for decades , disney's new film is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere , story intact , to some neutral territory , and revels in its east asian roots ; aside from a predominantly asian-american cast providing the film's vocal work , there's liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout , and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence . 

while the film does occasionally reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes -- invoking pseudo-asian references to items like beancurd and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary , and i can't imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors * really * included karate-chopping blocks of stone in two -- it's rather remarkable that a movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory . 

the film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset ; although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately , it's startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulan's land . 

at its core , the film is a tale of heroic adventure , and as such paints its story in bold strokes of honour , perseverance , nobility and courage . 

as such , animation is the perfect vehicle for this flavour of epic , where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work hand-in-hand with visual purity . 

scenes which would play out as unbearably hokey in live action , such as mulan's venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice , are lent a sense of strength and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation . 

mulan capitalizes on this during its strongest moments , particularly during our heroine's character-defining opening half-hour . 

it's when the film attempts to integrate the traditional mainstays of recent hollywood animation -- the friendly animal sidekick , the colourful array of supporting characters -- into the mix where it goes slightly awry . 

off to battle , mulan finds herself being trailed by a jive-talking diminutive dragon called mushu and an agreeable little "" lucky "" cricket , who ostensibly appear to assist in her subterfuge and realistically serve as audience-friendly comic relief . 

they're affable presences , and not precisely ineffective -- reasonable amounts of humour are elicited , and eddie murphy ( who voices mushu ) is amusingly earnest -- but amidst all the high melodrama , the effect is mildly jarring and , from a storytelling perspective , questionable in its necessity . 

at training camp , mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits ( easily characterized simply as the short clown , the skinny clown , and the big clown ) , who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness , and , in a familiar retread of traditional disney patterns , she grows a certain fondness for a handsome , square-jawed young captain , shang . 

everybody needs love , even ancient chinese warrior princesses , but not necessarily in * this * film . 

the romantic angle , which lets the air out of the sails of the story's neo-feminist underpinnings , lacks any genuine spark and plays out like a contractual obligation . 

another staple of recent disney animated films , a cache of hummable little ditties , has also obligingly been carried over to mulan but proves to be a decided weakness . 

composed by matthew wilder , none of the handful of tunes are particularly distinguishing , and one -- "" i'll make a man out of you "" ( unimaginatively accompanying a tired montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean fighting machines ) -- becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems almost interminable . 

only "" reflections "" , an early ballad of lament , proves to be a song of any consequence , serving as an effective showcase for lea salonga , one of musical theatre's most wondrously pure voices . 

nonetheless , mulan is an especially appealing piece of work from the disney factory , with a strong narrative arc and pleasant artwork ; the computer-generated stampede of hun warriors charging down a snow mountain is wholly impressive . 

while the blatantly child-friendly elements at times seem incongruous with the remainder of the film , they're not dissuasive and remain fairly enjoyable . 

briskly paced with a smart , energetic heroine and filled with high adventure , the film is ultimately most satisfying on the intimate scale of father and daughter .

"sometimes a stellar cast can compensate for a lot of things , and "" pushing tin "" certainly features some name stars who are going places : billy bob thornton , cate blanchett , angelina jolie , and oh yes john cusack who might not realize it at first , but he's actually the * veteran * among this quartet of fine-looking people . 

sometimes a terrific cast like this can compensate for a lackluster screen treatment of an idea that has "" hip comedy "" written all over it , compensate for workmanlike but uninspired direction , compensate for an obnoxious score that would have anyone but the tone deaf screaming for the exits , compensate for clich ? d characterizations , compensate for embarrassing "" you have to be joking "" situations . 

etc . 

in "" pushing tin , "" thornton , blanchett , jolie , and cusack don't have an earthly . 

from the opening sequence the film is in big trouble : squiggly , "" quirky "" credits , fake-looking passenger planes circling new york , and anne dudley's in-your-ear music making us wonder how she ever got that best original score nomination for "" the full monty , "" let alone won it . 

but i , for one , wasn't ready to walk just yet . 

so quickly we descend into a tightly-edited air traffic controllers montage which screams to us in large capital letters these people have a difficult job , yes , what with their frantic , mile-a-minute instructional personas , juggling planes and passenger's lives like some huge , real , mid-air video game . 

hip , cool , demonic auctioneer nick "" the zone "" falzone ( cusack ) is the best in the biz . 

of course . 

until some hipper , cooler , leather-clad flyboy assist in the guise of russell bell ( thornton ) shows up to challenge falzone's finite air space . 

boys will be boys and some heavy duty testosterone starts exuding , then the macho one-upmanship begins . 

it doesn't stop with seeing who can juggle three 747s within a cat's whisker of each other . 

oh no . 

there are some broken hoop dreams , some wanna-see-how-fast-i-can-drives , and then the ultimate showdown : was that my wife i saw you with last night ? 

director mike newell ( "" four weddings and a funeral "" ) must have read a different draft of this script because the one that's being acted out up there between newark , jfk , and la guardia doesn't have an ounce of subtlety , and newell has made some awfully good-and funny-movies before . 

the antics of these air traffic controllers will make you cringe . 

they'll make you frown in disbelief . 

they'll have you constantly looking at your watch . 

but wait ! 

there's still 100 minutes to go ! ! 

the film's only saving grace is blanchett , whose connie falzone is a spunky , brash , long island housewife who wants to better herself by taking art classes . 

this is a wonderful accomplishment for the fine actress who has previously played a red-headed australian gambler ( "" oscar and lucinda "" ) and a tempestuous british monarch ( "" elizabeth "" ) . 

but she's not enough to save the picture . 

thornton looks terrific and performs solidly but his character is a joke . 

jolie ( as russell's knock 'em dead wife ) isn't bad , but the up-and-coming actress disappoints by allowing herself to be displayed like a plaything . 

cusack cracks gum , dons shades , and acts hip throughout but , like everything else in the film , his performance is forced . 

in the last ten minutes or so , for some inexplicable reason , things start coming together and you begin to get a sense of how this film might have been , like the trailer teases . 

but it's too little too late . 

a fine cast aside , "" pushing tin "" is nothing more than an embarrassment .

"the happy bastard's quick movie review 

the concept of enjoying a stupid comedy is best realized as keeping it stupid , really . 

shift gears even once and the audience can be thrown miserably out of control . 

sadly , that is the case with kingpin , a film directed by the farrelly brothers , the duo that brought us there's something about mary and dumb and dumber . 

since the duo directed and didn't write the script , i can assume that's part of the problem . 

the story seems good enough : a pro bowler in the 1970's by the name of roy munson ( woody harrelson ) is sitting on top of the world . 

his popularity has gone through the roof and he's getting his career off the ground . 

then , however , he runs into ed mccracken ( bill murray ) , a rival bowler with hardly any real consideration for , well , anything . 

these two form an ill-timed relationship that involves risky betting , and , before roy sees it coming , ed's abandoned him and he's about to lose his hand in a bowling ball machine . 

forward seventeen years later , where roy has become quite the loser , complete with mechanical hand , torn-up car , and , of course , the occasional knocking up of the ugly-ass landlord to avoid paying rent for a while . 

however , he finds a glimmer of a hope upon a visit to a local bowling alley , where he runs into an amish kid named ishmael ( randy quaid ) , who has quite the bowling arm . 

with the kid's help , he figures he can be known again , particularly at the biggest bowling tournament rapidly approaching in reno , nevada . 

of course , the amish kid needs some coaxing , particularly when you consider , well , he's amish . 

this leads to some of the best comic scenes in the film , such as roy's process of removing horseshoes or milking the cow . 

finally , the duo get on the road and , along the way , pick up an additional helper- a beautiful hustler ( played by the gorgeous vanessa angel ) . 

the main problem i had with kingpin wasn't the fact it wasn't funny . 

in fact , it does have some rather hilarious scenes in it , such as the aformentioned above and roy's explanation of not having children ( something involving a cheese grater ? ) . 

but that's just it- scenes . 

there's a couple of really serious scenes that throw off the entire momentum of the movie , like the abuse angel takes from her hustler ex-boyfriend . 

i mean , was this really necessary ? 

couldn't have this been handled just a bit wackier ? 

i mean , this is a comedy , why throw ethics in ? 

particularly in a farrelly brothers vehicle , where hair gel can be easily mistaken ? 

that really ruined it , however , and that's too bad . 

the acting is top notch , especially from angel and murray , and the really funny scenes are worth noting . 

still , if you're going to think dumb , think dumb all the way through , ok ? 

at least the farrelly brothers got back on track with mary or i'd still be a little bit irked .

"susan granger's review of "" the watcher "" ( universal ) 

just what we need : another lurid , trashy serial killer saga . 

this time , keanu reeves plays an elusive homicidal maniac who engages in a gruesome ticking-clock cat-and-mouse game with james spader , a burnt-out fbi agent who has suffered a traumatic nervous breakdown after too many years on the job with the lapd . 

to taunt spader , who has relocated to chicago , reeves packs up his trusty piano wire and moves too . 

before long , he starts mailing photographs of the lonely , unsuspecting young women who are his intended windy city victims , challenging spader , along with the chicago police department , to stop him within 24 hours before he strikes again . 

in the midst of this murderous frenzy , there's spader's psychologist , played by marisa tomei , who is even less convincing as a medical professional than jennifer lopez in "" the cell . "" 

writers david elliot , clay ayers and darcy meyers , along with first-time director joe charbanic ( helmer of music videos for reeves' band dogstar ) , dwell on the warped thrill of the methodology and the chase , revealing , early on , exactly whodunit since the killer says he and the cop "" need each other to give meaning to our lives . "" 

plus , as reeves explains , "" we're all stacked right on top of each other , but we don't notice each other any more . "" 

after that , it's all sound effects and tricky camera-work , along with a muddled , discordant soundtrack . 

james spader's acting technique can be described as 'wooden deadpan' while keanu reeves maintains his perpetually monotone 'dude' persona which sometimes works , sometimes doesn't . 

chris ellis , as spader's self-important colleague , is the only cast member who manages to be convincing . 

on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" the watcher "" is an appallingly awful , amateurish 2 . the real torture is watching it . 
"
"well , as i check my score card for what i've done this holiday weekend , it reads good ideas : 0 and dumb ideas : 1 . 

i don't know what i was thinking when i decided to watch this movie . 

but in my defense , i can only say that it was someone else who urged me to see this with him . 

the film that i'm talking about is `a night at the roxbury , ' one of those offerings based on a saturday night live skit . 

wayne and garth , these two are not . 

rather , we meet doug and steve butabi ( the actors' names are not worth mentioning ) , two eternal partyers whose greatest ambitions in life seem to be finding a way to get into the hottest night club in the city , the roxbury . 

driving in their dad's bmw and donning metallic disco suits right out of miami vice , they try to bribe the bouncer to get into the club . 

`have you met my friend washington and his friend roosevelt , ' they confidently say as they pull out spare pocket change . 

their second greatest ambition seems to be oozing out as many silly pick-up lines as is humanly possible in order to start a conversation with a girl ( `let me see that label . 

just as i thought - made in heaven , ' says one of the brothers ) . 

and , like the losers that they are , they fail to do either for much of the film . 

however , as fate would have it , an accidental meeting with `what-ever-happened-to' richard grieco gives them the all-important ticket to get in . 

their sad lives take on a whole new direction . 

they make an important contact with the club owner who believes that these two brothers have uncanny insight into the club scene . 

and they are mistaken as rich swingers by two voluptuous young women . 

but their newfound popularity does not impress their father , who has other plans for them . 

the unfortunate thing about this film is that this is a one-joke movie , and the brothers are the joke . 

actually , there's about 10 mintues worth of tolerable stuff . 

alas , too long for tv and way too short for a feature-length film . 

thus , there just isn't enough material to sustain the 83-minute movie . 

there's no plot to be found and everything that these two do seem to culminate in an opportunity to execute their trademark move of snapping their heads in unison to the funky beat of haddaway's europop song , what is love . 

i was amazed that none of the two suffered from whiplash . 

to take up more film time , there is a subplot involving the daughter of the businessman next door who wants to marry doug . 

this creates not only friction between the brothers , but their unlikely pairing will also agitate audience members as well . 

she's educated and a forebearing witch . 

meanwhile , doug is a complete loser . 

how did these two ever get together ? 

i suppose that if i can ever figure out the answer to that question , i'll have figured out why i decided to go and see this movie . 

if you're looking for entertainment , you won't find it at the roxbury .

" "" virus "" is a monster movie without a monster . 

any movie with a hurdle that large to overcome had better be pretty damn good otherwise . 

sadly , "" virus "" does not deliver , on any level . 

the movie opens with the russian space station mir about to transmit something ( we never find out what ) to a big boat with lots of satellites on it . 

sudddenly , a wave of colorful lightning comes flying through space , and winds up destroying mir and using it to transmit itself to the aforementioned big boat . 

cut to seven days later , we meet donald sutherland and his band of seafaring vultures . 

see , they spend all their time sailing around looking for dead-in-the-water ships to rescue , and then collect the reward money . 

at least , i * think * that's what they do . 

along with many other things in the film , their reason for being out in the middle of the ocean isn't really explained . 

so , they stumble upon this big boat with lots of satellites on it , and decide to haul it back to russian waters . 

the only problem is , the crew starts disappearing one-by-one and turning into borg . 

yes , borg . 

complete with the red laser beam in place of an eye . 

apparently , this alien lifeform can only survive if inside something electrical . 

so , it creates make-shift machines and uses humans for "" spare parts "" . 

blah , blah , blah . 

i could go on forever describing the ludicrous so-called plot , but i won't . 

suffice it to say the most original thing about this movie is having donald sutherland play an irish man ( ! ) . 

everything else in this movie has been taken from other ( better ) movies . 

for example , many of the machines resemble those found in the little-seen japanese movie , "" tetsuo-the iron man "" . 

and the plot is right out of "" aliens "" . 

the funny thing is , i was actually expecting to enjoy this movie . 

i have a soft spot for cheesy monster movies , like last years under-appreciated "" deep rising "" . 

but "" virus "" , as i mentioned earlier , doesn't even have a monster . 

it just has a big pile of circuits and wires and expects the audience to fear this ridiculous looking contraption . 

 "" virus "" is the type of movie that really makes you wonder what the screenwriter was thinking about when he wrote it . 

besides the lame "" monster "" , it's chock full of dialogue that no real person would ever say , and situations that no real person would ever allow themselves to get into . 

for example , there is a scene late in the movie in which one of the characters actually attempts to * negotiate * with the alien ! 

now , i don't know about you , but if i came upon a lifeform that viewed mankind as a virus to be eliminated , i doubt that i would attempt to reason with it . 

that makes about as much sense as a baby squirrel calmly asking a fierce predator to spare his life . 

finally , "" virus "" isn't scary . 

the least the filmmakers could have done was to make the movie just a little scary . 

as it is , it's about as frightening as a box of cookies . 

skip "" virus "" . 

if it's a cool monster movie you want , rent the far superior ( and the granddaddy of this genre ) "" aliens "" .

"disney's 35th animated feature-- a retooling of the olympian legend crossed with , well , the superman story-- is surprisingly soft at the center . 

great wit , great art , and a great villain ( james woods as hades , lord of the underworld and local lounge act ) can't quite stifle the yawns induced by a bland hero , his colorfully monotonous sidekick ( danny devito as the satyrical trainer phil ) , and a largely unremarkable soundtrack . 

 ( none of the alan menken/david zippel tunes are particular- ly noteworthy . 

some lack lyrical snap . 

others need more memorable melodies . 

boring ballads we expect , but boring production numbers , too ? ) 

so , hercules is a bit of a long sit , but you won't stay bored . 

the highlights include a nifty round of animated action ( herc battling a cgi hydra ) , a steady stream of anachronisms ( "" somebody call ix-i-i "" ) and pop references ( "" let's get ready to rumble ! "" ) a la aladdin , and several long-overdue jabs at the mouse's marketing and merchandising depart- ments . 

while not as rock-solid as hunchback , it's a still a new world of improvement over pocohontas . 

directed by ron clements and john musker , with voice credits including tate donovan , susan egan , bob goldthwait , matt frewer , samantha eggar , paul shaffer , and , as lighting bolt zeus , rip torn , who's having a very good summer , also appearing in trial and error and men in black .

" "" something is fishy in the state of universal . "" 

about ten years back , with the unexpected success of mad max and the road warrior , post-apocalypse nitty-gritty survival yarns became popular at the movies . 

we've always had movies of this nature ; on the beach , the end of the world , damnation alley , the ultimate warrior , and so on . 

to date , the most smoothly done were straightforward "" haircuts "" of the classic western plot , like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects the widow and the son against an evil organization , usually one in possession of some critical resource , like water , feed range , or a mining claim . 

most of these grew out of venerable , but solid hero yarns like the virginian and shane . 

 ( my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn , which was fairly well made on a small budget . ) 

now we have waterworld , which again brings the traditional lone gunman to town to rescue the young widow and her daughter . 

 ( well , she's not a widow , and the kid isn't her daughter , but you get the idea . ) 

the lady is helen , played by the stunning jean tripplehorn , who isn't given a chance to be stunning , or even interesting , by the mediocre and unimaginative script . 

the child enola , played by tina majorino , is living proof that a child actor need not be a bad thing to have in a movie ; she outshines her material all the way through . 

in simple , the scene is earth , hundreds of years from now . 

the polar ice caps have melted , and somehow produced enough water to inundate the entire planet . 

the few remaining people live in boats and floating colonies , and survive by trade , theft , or piracy . 

somehow an oil tanker has survived the centuries , and its inhabitants , called "" smokers , "" are able to keep gasoline engines running despite the dearth of replacement parts and raw materials , so the bad guys have outboard engines , and fast-moving boats , airplanes , and jet skis . 

enola , found at sea as a young girl , has a mysterious map no one can read tattooed on her back . 

we suspect early on that it is the way to the mythical "" dryland , "" the place where trees , crops , and animals grow , and what plot there is hinges on who has enola . 

the psycho ruler of the smokers , the "" deacon , "" is trying to get her and find his way to dryland . 

played with typical self-lampooning , rug-chewing histrionics by dennis hopper , "" deacon "" is the only thing in the movie that's close to amusing . 

his performance is * almost * laughable , but there just isn't enough there to be funny . 

the star ( and a co-producer ) is kevin costner . 

he's playing an un-named lone denizen of the sea , a man called the "" mariner , "" who turns out to be a gilled , water-breathing mutant with webbed feet . 

very little is done with this . 

the script ignores the ineffectuality of gills in supplying enough oxygen to support a human metabolism ; it ignores the fact that even with both ice caps completely melted , much of the earth's surface would still be above water ; and it ignores the blatant impossibility of the cultures and technology shown . 

 ( canned meat does * not * last for centuries ; ammunition does * not * fire after it's more than a few decades old ; and so on , and so on . . . ) 

i'm quite fond of tina majorino's previous work , very impressed by jean tripplehorn's past accomplishments , and still speechless over costner's dances with wolves . 

but this movie could destroy the careers of anyone associated with it ! 

this movie cost one hundred and eighty-two million dollars , and there's * nothing * in it we haven't seen before , done better on only a few percent of the cost of this turkey . 

at 125 minutes of material , this movie cost over one point four million dollars per minute to make . 

the budget of this movie * could * have given us over thirty movies ; it could have paid for six years of a prime-time sf tv series with expensive fx work , or ten years of an sf tv series with good digital fx . 

in sum , this movie is beneath contempt . 

it has nothing new to offer , it has a script that could easily have been bettered by the people who write comic books for dc , and it spent more money than the national budget of a small nation . 

if you * have * to go see it , see it on a four-dollar matinee . 

otherwise you'll find yourself sneering at you every time you pass a reflective surface , for weeks . 
"
" * * * be warned . . . 

the following review contains some harsh language * * * 

the blair witch project . 

quite possibly the least scariest movie of all time . 

if you want to see real terror on the big screen go back and watch any scene with jar jar binks in the phantom menace , because this movie is not scary or even remotely creepy . 

my colleague and friend chuck dowling wrote that if less is more , then the blair witch filmmakers must have thought that nothing is more . 

and this worked for him . 

well , i'm sorry , but nothing . . . 

is nothing ! ! ! ! ! 

nothing is not more . 

it's nothiiiiiinggggggggggg ! ! ! ! ! ! . 

i do not pay 5 dollars to see nothing . 

 "" nothing "" is free , available all around the world at a location near you . 

i am absolutely in amazement that some people find this movie scary . 

i could just discount them and say , "" well , i guess they are just pansy chicken shits who are probably scared of their own shadow . "" 

but i have intelligent friends who like this movie and so that doesn't hold water . 

there must be some other reason . 

 ( then again , maybe my first thought is correct , i think i'll try pointing their shadow out to them one day and test their reaction . ) 

when i hear people praising this film , i never hear them talking about what makes up about 97% of this movie : three kids bickering with each other about being lost . 

they only talk about what might make up possibly 3 to 4 minutes of screen time . 

this being a few very short night scenes where the kids hear some unscary sounds and another where they shout "" josh ! ! "" 

over and over . 

this film should not be called the blair witch project , it should more accurately be called three dumb and pisspoor filmmakers get lost . . . 

and argue with each other . 

oh ladies and gentlemen you will be so scared when you hear them shouting "" josh ! ! "" . 

and if you thought that was scary , wait till you see a pile of rocks , and then some tinkertoy lincoln logs , oh my dear lord you will be pissing in your pants with fear . 

oh yeah , and some goo on one of their backpacks . 

you've never seen terror like this folks , and you don't want to . 

the chevy chase/goldie hawn comedy foul play is creepier than this film . 

 ( for current films , i highly recommend the sixth sense or a stir of echoes for a creepy filmgoing experience . ) 

this film is an example of marketing with no substance . 

the marketing was brilliant , and the whole nation is in awe of just the premise for the film . 

they want this film to be good . 

and i think they are reaching and praising the wrong movie because they don't have anything else to praise . 

that wonderful film that rejuvenates the horror genre may come along , but this is not it . 

this film could have been so much better . 

just think , if maybe there had been only 10 minutes of arguing about being lost , and 80 minutes of nighttime stuff . 

i saw this movie with a girl who was extremely pumped for it . 

she was sold on this film . 

and then , at one point during it , she turned to me and asked ' . . . are 

we supposed to be scared by this ? ' . 

i've heard one opinion that you "" have to use your imagination "" to create the fear in this movie . 

well , i thought that was what the filmmakers were supposed to do . 

use their imagination and create a good movie . 

i mean anyone can use their imagination and not pay 5 bucks for it . 

but even if you like this idea , then what are you imagining ? 

an entity called the blair witch ? 

some rednecks fucking with these kids ? 

are either of these things really scary when you think about it ? ? ? 

i've heard several people say that this movie makes them recall how scary it can be to be out in the woods and hear something . 

well sure thats scary in real life , but there are a lot of things that are scary in real life that are not scary in a movie nor even interesting . 

you could sit in your house and see a snake or a spider and it could be scary , but in a film it wouldn't be . 

and no , a movie does not need a big budget or cgi special effects to be scary or creepy . 

actually the less the better ( see the equally awful remake of the haunting ) . 

but you have to do something . 

you cant just count on us all having nostalgic memories of how something like this could be scary , if it were real . 

and by the way , about the shakycam filming in blair witch . 

aren't these supposed to be "" filmmakers "" who should know how to point a camera and shoot something without shaking the camera constantly ? 

i'm not even talking about the couple scenes where they are terrified , that's justified . 

i'm talking about the other 87 minutes of the movie where they can't seem to shoot anything smoothly at all . 

minor quibble there . 

there is a feeling in me that the people that like this movie are suckers . 

that the filmmakers are just laughing their asses off all the way to the bank . 

and i think there is a good chance they will see this film again and say to themselves "" what was i thinking ? ? "" . 

but , if they don't , then thats fine . 

if it works for them then that's okay i guess . 

i just lament that by making this movie a hit , we are going to be subjected to more of the "" nothing is more "" approach . 

pretty soon we're going to get some movies like this : just a still shot of a prison jail cell . 

for 90 minutes . 

and we'll have to use our imagination and think to ourselves , "" my god , wouldn't it be scary to spend life in prison ? ! ! 

this movie is the scariest movie of all time ! ! ! ! ! "" . 

or , a shot of a coffin , with some funeral directors arguing with each other . 

 "" man , do you know how scary it would be to die ? ? ? ! ! ! ! 

now this is the scariest movie of all time ! ! ! ! ""

"susan granger's review of "" the perfect storm "" ( warner bros . ) 

 "" more people die on fishing boats , per capita , than working in any other job in the u . s . . 

every journey a fishing boat makes can be an all-or-nothing risk . 

it is life at its most exhilarating and its most terrifying , "" says director wolfgang petersen ( "" das boot "" ) . 

and that's just what he captures in this true story of struggle and humanity aboard a swordfishing boat , the andrea gail , sailing out of gloucester , massachusetts , in late october , 1991 . 

early in bill wittliff's screenplay , based on sebastian junger's best-seller , we meet the crew of six . 

the veteran captain ( george clooney ) is frustrated because he can't find fish on the grand banks , yet a rival skipper ( mary elizabeth mastrantonio ) brings in huge hauls . 

his right-hand man ( mark walhberg ) needs money to build a new life with his girl-friend ( diane lane ) . 

there's a devoted dad ( john c . reilly ) with an estranged wife and son , a free-spirited jamaican ( allen payne ) , a lonely guy ( john hawkes ) , and a last-minute replacement with a bad attitude ( william fichtner ) . 

the skipper's convinced he can change his bad luck streak in remote flemish cap , and he does . 

but then trouble begins . 

there's a rogue wave , a man overboard and the ice machine breaks - with 60 , 000 lb . 

of fish that could spoil . 

but that's minor compared with a deadly monster storm approaching which a boston meteorologist describes as "" a disaster of epic proportions "" that also threatens the lives of a coast guard helicopter rescue team trying to save three people stranded on a sailboat on the high seas . 

it's formulaic and there are cliches , but the walls of water , created by fluid dynamics simulating real-life phenomena , are awesome . 

on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" the perfect storm "" is a terrifying , suspenseful 8 . 

hang on for the white-knuckle thrill ride of the summer !

"that thing you do ! , from first-time film director tom hanks , is an enjoyable tale about a fictional band , the wonders , that goes from a garage band to the band with the fastest selling album in the country . 

but , the question arrises , will the seduction of fame and fortune corrupt the band and lead them to become just another one-hit wonder , or will they stick together and become the next teen sensations ? 

the "" oneders "" , as they are originally known , have their first gig at a very small-time contest . 

jimmy , the lead singer , has written a catchy song and intends to play it at the contest . 

but , a short time before the contest begins , the current drummer becomes injured and a replacement is needed . 

enter guy patterson , skilled musician who currently works at his father's appliance store and is looking to break free from the restricting clutches that bind him . 

he seems to fit in well , until the group takes the stage . 

when they begin to play , guy's beat is much too fast and the pace is way off for the intended song . 

it looks as though the group is doomed to failure . 

but , the "" new "" song is a hit ! 

this leads to another gig , and soon enough , the group has an agent . 

he doesn't do too much for them , but they do get their song played on the radio . 

eventually , mr . white of playtone records approaches the group , and he informs them that they want to release a record . 

before you can say "" billboard "" , the band is now renamed "" the wonders "" and the members are speeding their way to fame . 

the gigs are getting better , their fame is increasing , and they have the fastest selling album in playtone records history . 

the band is invited to appear in a feature film , and , they then fly out to hollywood to appear on television . 

after the appearance on television , things start to fall apart . 

two of the members of the band pretty much disappear , and things are not working out well between jimmy and guy . 

will the band work it out , or will they split up and go on their own separate journeys towards success ? 

that thing you do ! , complete with a nifty original song that actually sounded authentic , is a fun and enjoyable movie that , although it doesn't become clear if it wants to be a comedy , drama , or romance , is a well-made look into the world of music . 

tom hanks' directorial debut was a good one and should lead to more work for him . 
"
"200 cigarettes takes place on new year's eve 1981 . 

monica , played by martha plimpton is having a huge new year's party . 

everyone in town is trying to get there , but some are caught up in other things . 

this is the basic plot of 200 cigarettes . 

as we meet the characters headed towards the party , we are sent into many subplots which are unoriginal , and not interesting at all . 

this disappointed me greatly . 

the film should have been more about the party than the people trying to get there in my opinion . 

lucy , played by courtney love , is with kevin , played by paul rudd . 

the two are in a relationship that is more of a friendship , but starts to blossom into something more than that . 

this subplot is extremely boring and dull , and i am getting quite sick of plots like that . 

janeane garofalo is involved in another subplot , dealing with kevin . 

she plays ellie , an ex-girlfriend of kevin's . 

this subplot is completely a waste of garofalo's talent . 

there was no point to it at all , and it was hardly even in the movie . 

when lucy runs into a bartender , played by ben affleck , another subplot is formed . 

the bartender is invited by lucy to come to monica's party . 

at the bar , he runs into two more girls . 

the girls are played by angela featherstone and nicole parker , but unfortunately , due to the terrible acting of both of them , i don't even remember their characters names . 

ben affleck is a good actor , but his character doesn't go anywhere so he doesn't have much screen time to give a good performance . 

featherstone and parker are horrible in their roles , and they are part of the reason the film is so bad . 

christina ricci plays val , and gaby hoffman plays stephie . 

the two girls are trying to get to the party but are extremely lost . 

they meet some guys and end up going around with them all night . 

this subplot was alright , but it was quite annoying with stephie's accent . 

hoffman did an okay job of acting , but ricci did good . 

she was underused , considering she is such a wonderful actress . 

another subplot in the film is the relationship between cindy , played by goldie hawn's daughter , and jack , played by jay mohr . 

jack is an actor who doesn't care about the girls he goes out with , he just likes dates for one night , and the next day he doesn't . 

kate hudson is a huge klutz . 

she gets herself into very funny situations , that are the funniest parts in the entire movie . 

they are probably the only funny parts in the entire movie as well . 

this subplot could have been used more , mainly due to hudson's performance . 

mohr wasn't good , but he wasn't bad . 

he was just alright , which i didn't find acceptable . 

there is not much to say about the performances in the film . 

none of the characters are developed or shown enough to really tell if the acting is good or not . 

the only performances that i can judge are christina ricci's as always good performance , kate hudson's funny role , courtney love's mediocre performance , and paul rudd's annoying and overused performance . 

i was hoping for a little more out of jaw mohr , ben affleck , casey affleck , gaby hoffman , dave chapelle , and especially out of janeane garofalo . 

the two strongest things in the film were the great soundtrack and the original costumes . 

martha plimpton and christina ricci had very different and original outfits which made me feel like i was in the year 1981 . 

the soundtrack is full of 1980's tunes , ranging from "" i want candy "" to "" tainted love . "" 

the songs in the movie also helped create the feel that you were back in the 1980s . 

during the film , i often found myself asking the questions , "" is there a reason to this ? 

is there any moral story ? 

is there a point ? 

are any of the events going on in the film necessary ? 

do i care what lucy and kevin are going through ? "" 

the movie is extremely boring , and by the time they reached eleven-o-clock , one hour before midnight , i could not wait for the movie to be over . 

the plot is okay , but the subplots make it terrible . 

maybe if the film was about the party , not about the people at the party , it could have been a lot better . 

the bottom line : just like a slasher movie , this ? 80s comedy is just one too many .

"plot : a big-time momma's boy can't seem to leave his mother's crib and make good on the babies that he himself has produced in the world . 

he visits his kids ( and their mommas ) every now and then , but his main goal in life is . . . well , he doesn't have any goals . 

then one day , his mother gets an ex-gangsta boyfriend and suddenly he isn't as welcome anymore in his own house . 

it isn't long after that , that his girlfriends start realizing what a jerk he really is and well . . . it's 

either time to grow up or bow down ! 

critique : first things first ! 

this movie ain't about the "" hood "" at all , it's an intelligent film about love , relationships , family , friendship , maturity and growing up . 

do not avoid this film because you think it's about gangbangers and stuff , because it isn't at all . 

it's about you , it's about me , it's about your girlfriend , your mother , your problems and your inability to face up to your responsibilities and to , well . . . grow 

up ! 

this is an extremely well-written film , with some of the most developed characters that i've seen on the screen all year , with superb acting performances to match . 

granted , the film does start a little slow ( and go a little long ) , but hang in there , because once you appreciate and get to know all of its characters , you will be glad that you did . 

this isn't a kid's movie . 

this is about the step that you need to take in order to pass into full "" adulthood "" and some might not appreciate the grander theme behind that step . 

i certainly did , because i too passed , and am passing , through many of these very same things right now ( yeah , yeah , i still live with my momma ! ! ) and related to a lot of the events that went down in this flick ( oh yeah , and for the record , i'm not black but that made absolutely zero difference in this case ) . 

but that's not even half the story . 

you see , the film is damn funny , too . . . and 

i mean , damn funny ! 

i was crackin' up at almost every other scene , and they weren't "" set-up jokes "" like your typical comedies either , just day-to-day things that we could all relate to ( like the scene in which ving rhames is "" drinking koolaid "" in the kitchen and his infamously improvised "" african squat f * * k "" scene , which you just gotta see to believe ! ) 

and there are the performances , too . 

ving rhames , now here's a man who has already established an early lead in the race for best supporting actor at the end of this year . 

damn dude , you scared the shit outta me ! 

tyrese gibson , i have no idea where this guy came from ( an r&b singer and mtv vj , you say . . . hmmmm ? ) , but other than his uncanny resemblance to taye diggs , he nailed this part to the tee . 

from scene one on , i was glued to his performance and sympathized with his character as he molded and shaped himself into the person that he hoped to become one day . 

and everyone else , too . 

gibson's girlfriend in the film , taraji henson , made me a backer with her many subtle touches , all of which helped raise her character several levels above the "" typical "" bitchie girlfriend that we've seen in many of these relationship movies . 

but that's the thing that i liked the most about this movie . 

everyone seemed real , the situations felt authentic , the characters all came across as people like you and me with issues and struggles and hopes and fears . 

i liked this movie a lot because it was masterfully written , wonderfully acted and genuinely entertaining to watch . 

and yeah , i even liked the whole homage to boyz 'n the hood that singleton pulled off in the end ( he called this movie a "" companion piece "" to that film ) . 

a very solid follow-up to an ever greater original , baby boy is a film to be seen by anyone who feels like they never wanna grow up . 

note : the guy who plays jody's best friend in this movie is omar gooding , cuba gooding jr . 's younger brother ( cuba starred in 1991's boyz 'n the hood ) . 

where's joblo coming from ? 

the best man ( 8/10 ) - brothers ( 5/10 ) - shaft ( 7/10 ) - summer of sam ( 7/10 ) - what's cooking ( 7/10 )

"not too many people know who james whale is , but it's a safe bet that a good chunk of them have seen his movies . 

if we are to believe the semi- biographical gods and monsters , whale would have wanted it to be that way . 

this is an insightful , haunting exploration of the last days of the frankenstein and bride of frankenstein director , and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in a hollywood movie . 

gods and monsters has no interest in being a biopic of whale's life because it tracks only the final few days of his life , and it's probably a better movie for it . 

it's focus is on whale's ( ian mckellen ) untraditional and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) . 

it begins with whale ( a fairly talented artist , aside from being a director ) asking boone to "" sit for him , "" ( pose for a portrait ) . 

at first , boone doesn't realize that whale is gay and grows fascinated with the old man . 

when he does discover whale's sexual orientation from his dedicated and protective maid ( lynn redgrave ) , he is frightened , refusing to sit for the guy . 

but he comes back , only to storm out again , disgusted with whale's "" locker room talk . "" 

boone returns yet another time , after whale promises to tone down the aforementioned "" locker room talk , "" and finds their platonic relationship to be strengthening . 

meanwhile , jimmy himself is suffering from hallucinations and mental attacks as a result of his stroke not long ago . 

his ailment leads to desperation and depression , which build to the point where he is forced to ask boone for an incredulously big favor . 

what is perhaps most sensational about gods and monsters is brendan fraser's bravura performance ; up until seeing this film i intensely disliked the young actor because of his tendency to ruin the movies he is in ( blast from the past , for example ) . 

i was surprised how expressive an actor he proved himself to be here . 

this is impressive because his character's dialogue is minimal , with mckellan doing most of the talking . 

that requires fraser to act through body language ; a difficult skill to master , but something he proves capable of doing well . 

this is not to ignore mckellan's oscar nominated turn . 

he earned that nomination with his touching performance here ( although , at the risk of sounding like a philistine , i would have chosen his performance as the nazi in apt pupil for the nomination ) ; an understated , compelling gem . 

whale dreaded being remembered solely for his work in the hollywood horror genre , and he thought hollywood to be the equivalent of a battlefield . 

he rejoiced in being free from it , only reluctantly going to receptions with fellow movie people . 

in the end , perhaps , it is what killed him : the memories of hollywood and war blending together to form a living nightmare .

"the stereotypical american male has an undeniable fetishistic love of sports cars . 

producer jerry bruckheimer plays upon that attraction with a movie so loaded with testosterone and laced titillatingly with shot after frenetic shot of powerful muscle cars , sleek foreign road huggers and iconic speed machines that many males will leave the theater in an orgasmic haze . 

gone is 60 seconds is an orgy of maleness gone horribly awry . 

cage is legendary retired car thief , memphis raines ( don't you love cute movie names ) , who must call upon his time worn skills to save his thick-headed brother ( ribisi ) from being killed . 

seems a murderous crime boss ( eccleston ) with a fetish for wood ( insert your own joke ) hired brother kip to steal a ridiculous amount of expensive , exotic autos . 

fifty cars , to be exact . 

poor kip screws the pooch and bungles the job badly . 

if the cars aren't delivered in three days , bossman has a casket carved out just for kip . 

literally . 

if only someone could save him . 

hmmmm . . wonder 

what memphis is doing ? 

in order to give the film some emotional heft , there are several subplots designed to tug at our heartstrings or give us the thrill of . . . yawn , excuse me , dramatic tension . 

shadowing memphis is an old law enforcement foe ( lindo ) who's looking to send memphis away . 

will he catch him ? 

there's old flame sway ( jolie ) , who had her heart broken by memphis years ago . 

will they get back together ? 

shortsighted , thrill seeker kip idolizes his brother , yet resents him for moving away from the family . 

will they reconnect ? 

raines old mentor ( duvall ) has long since left the life of crime . 

will memphis get him finally caught as he pulls him back into the life , one more time ? 

can you answer all these questions correctly in 2 seconds without seeing the film first ? 

i'll bet you can . 

following the opening credits , which fill you in on the accomplishments of the raines family through a montage of old photos , we was taken full throttle into the splendor that is memphis . 

he's first shown living the good life teaching young children to drive go-carts . 

in a later scene , as misfit brother kip knowingly tells memphis he has the stolen car situation under control , all the while making breakfast , a metaphor is made of shakespearean proportions . 

just as a pan of grease flares up with kip clueless to how to quell it , big brother memphis calmly and efficiently throws some salt on it . 

looks like everything might turn out alright after all . 

you know this because the music swells on the crest of violins . 

that's about as strong as the characterization gets , which is a shame . 

bruckheimer has a real talent for loading his movies with an obscene amount of talent given the task at hand . 

monumentally underused jolie portrays an empty headed sexpot whose idea of sex revolves around cars and memphis . 

or maybe it's just the cars . 

duvall trots out his ornery , but sweet old codger outfit . 

i'm sure he's still laughing at taking a paycheck for this one . 

lindo projects a warm hearted , but tightly focused detective that almost transcends the material . 

the biggest waste of resources is vinnie jones , who plays a mute accomplice of memphis . 

without saying a word , he is easily the most charismatic person in the movie . 

like a blast of nitrous oxide , he attacks each scene with a straightforward zeal . 

too bad his minutes onscreen are so few . 

somehow , bruckheimer manages to attract top hollywood acting talent to high concept , poorly written movies , gussies up the film with lots of gold hues and pleasingly stylized action and they sell like proverbial hotcakes . 

every time something clever happens it's counterbalanced by something so overtly wrong that it jerks you back into realizing you're watching a movie . 

there's a innovative usage of black lighting that goes from being a novelty to a part of the plot . 

it's counterbalanced by an extremely feeble attempt at humor by having an asian american repeatedly failing a driver's test . 

imagine the yuks . 

there's a segment where one of the thieves shows another his cool fake fingerprint trick . 

it's countered by the lame semi-subplot of a car being stolen with a bunch of heroin in the trunk . 

the ramifications are never explored . 

then there's the ridiculousness of the many cops who actually shoot at fleeing cars . 

not only is it stupid , but it's against the law . 

this is a movie made of pretty , but tepid car chases strung together by just enough character interaction to move the plot along . 

gone in 60 seconds aptly describes how long it'll take for this marginally entertaining , but empty film to leave your memory . 
"
"ready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film ; i have a problem even regarding it as a film . 

it's more of a show , a big commercial for ted turner's world championship wrestling ( wcw ) . 

the movie is almost entirely about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page , goldberg , and sting . 

the story is very minimal and basic . 

there are these two guys , gordy ( david arquette ) and sean ( scott caan ) . 

they are two twenty-something wrestling fans from wyoming . 

when they go to a live event for the big match up , there favorite wrestler jimmy king ( oliver platt ) is defeated and his career is announced to be over by the mean commissioner titus ( joe pantoliano ) . 

gordy and sean decide to go on a quest to find jimmy and bring him back to the top and defeat the evil titus' plans . 

on the way , they meet some people , have some fun , and clean up some port-o-potties . 

sounds great huh , well it's not . 

the movie makes many attempts at humor , only a few of them work . 

the jokes that make you laugh , however , do not outnumber the film's many duds . 

there is a funny repertoire between arquette and a convenience store cashier played by ahmet zappa . 

the cashier is very mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways to get him back . 

i especially enjoyed one version in which they have a wrestling match and arquette's tag team partner is 'macho man' randy savage . 

they wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans and getting body slammed on the floor . 

the other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette and rose mcgowan . 

mcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl , the cheerleaders of the wcw . 

she becomes attracted to gordy and they have some nice , funny scenes together especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowan's breasts foreign objects than punches her directly into the face . 

now what didn't work in this movie ? 

that would be the rest of it . 

the flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts and toilets . 

the two lead characters work for a port-o-potty cleaning company and when they crash the truck , the excrements spill all over the road . 

it's not funny ; it's pathetic and brainless . 

the film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of their wrestlers but not all wrestling fans are that way . 

i watch it for entertainment and i would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie . 

the main characters in the film actually get to wrestle , like that would happen to any fan , especially to 2 that stalk a wrestler and sneak him back onto set . 

also , i wondered how they got into the backstage so easily ; they just walked right in . 

i like wrestling . 

i watch it at home and laugh . 

it's continuously funny and has great characters otherwise i wouldn't watch it . 

this movie wasn't even funny or fun to watch like the wrestling on tv . 

the only fun i had in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers i knew . 

the funny thing was that many of the wcw featured wrestlers like saturn and chris benoit have left wcw for more money but are still featured in the film prominently . 

the movie was too dim-witted to be funny . 

it is possibly the most useless and under-developed film ever . 

a recent film in this genre of fans would be the kiss fan film , detroit rock city . 

that movie was interesting , well done and continuously funny unlike this film . 

the acting was good plus the jokes had humor and made you laugh . 

now that the scream trilogy is over , arquette has nothing else to do so he has to do crap like this and be a spokesman in those dumb 1-800-call-att ads . 

at least he has a hot wife in courtney cox . 

he's in the funny parts of the film but there aren't enough to make him look good . 

the music was bad also feature such overplayed tunes as kid rock's "" bawitdaba "" and "" cowboy "" . 

martin landau has a great cameo as a classic , hard-nosed wrestling trainer named sal that whips the king back into shape to regain his throne . 

script is important to a film but this piece of crap could have been made with a couple of scribblings on a napkin . 

a fan of the wrestlers who are featured in the film probably wrote it . 

at times the movie even tries to show wrestling as real . 

the wrestlers form alliances , go to people's houses and beat them up . 

it's utterly ridiculous . 

the whole film was a wasteful , dumfounding experience . 

the movie was made to pay homage to the fans , telling them things that made wrestling , not the wrestlers . 

the wrestlers are making more money to make a movie to thank the fans for begin fans by paying 5 dollars to see a potty-humor movie . 

the wcw sucks and this movie is just a pathetic two-hour commercial to watch it . 

if you're going to watch wrestling watch wwf , it's actually entertaining . 

the wrestling is betters , they're funnier , more diverse , and have better entrance themes . 

oh and the girls are hotter . 

is this what movies have become , 2 hour-long commercials that you have to pay to see ? 

don't waste your money .

"various films seen at the seattle film festival : 

it's all true/three men on a raft ( u . s . a . , 1942/1986 ) director : orson welles 

a recently uncovered one-fourth of orson welle's planned "" docu-drama "" of amazing stories around the world named it's all true , this short dealt with welle's attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on a raft . 

while several clips of the film are seen , the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle's attempts to film it , despite studio problems , a staggering workload , and extremely ill fortune on the set . 

impressive photography , but really only interesting to film historians . 

sadie thompson ( u . s . a . , 1928 ) director : raoul walsh screenwriter : raoul walsh , from the john colton play "" rain "" , based on w . somerset maugham's story "" miss thompson "" cast : gloria swanson , raoul walsh , lionel barrymore silent 

after the discussion of the newly-restored version of frank capra's lost horizon , where several scenes had been restored using stills , i was interested to see sadie thompson , where the last 5 minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago . 

this is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story "" miss thompson "" . 

this is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seen--little awkwardness , and a very clever script . 

the actors : gloria swanson , raoul walsh ( who also directed and wrote the screenplay ) and especially lionel barrymore , as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie's soul , but really wants to get her between the sheets , is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel . 

swanson adds real life to the character , adding an worldly , affectionate air to the bawdy sadie . 

unfortunately , the ending is rather poorly tied up ; it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live-action film , or the original script . 

the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on ( i cannot believe maugham's short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia ) ; the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we've been waiting an hour and a half for . 

still , it's entertaining right up to the end ; certainly barrymore's incredibly hammy performance ( which , nonetheless , works , perhaps due to the silent screen ) is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells , bakkers , and robertses of the religious worlds . 

a c movie ; worth 2 . 50 if you can find it . 

the pied piper ( czechoslovakia , 1986 ) director : jim barta screenwriter : kamil piza 

this is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids . 

it tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate , and with a lot of political comment along with it . 

perhaps economic content is a better word--it certainly doesn't show capitalism in a good light . 

nor human nature , nor anything else , for that matter . 

as you may have guessed , this is not a tgif film ; this is the kind of film you are glad is over . 

not that it wasn't interesting for technical reasons ; this is stop-animation that is very well done . 

all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts--except for the animated stuffed rats . 

boy , sounds like a real comedy vehicle , doesn't it ? 

add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison , and you have something to give the wee ones ( and some of the mentally unstable larger folk ) to keep them up at night . 

some gore . 

don't bring children to this one . 

don't bring adults to this one , unless they're fascinated by puppetry and/or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped . 

blech . 

 . no fun whatsoever . 

meier ( west germany , 1986 ) director/screenwriter : peter timm cast : rainier grenkowitz , nadja engelbrecht , alexander hauff , thomas besvater sub-titled 

this film takes us back and forth over the east german/west german border with meier , an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him a good deal of money . 

his uncle ( also in the west ) sneaks meier out of the country , unknown to the east germans . 

meier , however , is less than thrilled-- his girlfriend , his friends and his job ( which he likes ) all exist in east germany . 

after a round-the-world trip ( his boss think's he's on leave in bulgaria ) , meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id , and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew's work--while everyone think's he's still living in east germany . 

of course , something goes wrong--and the ending is very funny , but it takes the film too long to get there . 

the humor is spread too thin , and much of the plot is too obvious ( as is the acting ) . 

still , a good concept for the comedy , and the last five minutes are pretty funny . 

c -- $2 . 50 . 

the right hand man ( australia , 1986 ) director : di drew screenplay : helen hodgman cast : rupert everett , hugo weaving , arthur dignam , jennifer claire , catherine mcclements 

after a lifetime of movie-going , and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival , i've learned several rules which , while not absolute , should certainly be given deference to : 

1 ) be wary of french comedies . 

these people like jerry lewis . 

2 ) ken russell is never going to grow up , no matter how long you wait . 

3 ) any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as "" old pouty-lips "" is probably not worth watching . 

4 ) when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography , watch out ! 

australia has good cinematographers up the whazoo , but since weir and miller left for foreign shores , finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult ( not impossible--witness malcolm last year ) task . 

well , i ignored rules 3 & 4 last night , and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards . 

it's as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 30's about tragedy among the gentry , and falling in love with people below your station , and horses . 

lots and lots of horses . 

the film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship , which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing , because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir . 

unfortunately , said son , a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times , kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident . 

highlights include the amputation sequence ; the doctor's daughter , who has the hots for the son , tasting his urine for a diagnosis ; their tender kissing with a window between them ( while it's raining--you'd think a woman studying medicine would know better ) . 

the photography is good , but i kept wishing for b&w--everything seems sepia-colored anyway . 

actually , i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instead , but that's life . 

grade : z . avoid like the plague , unless you're looking for inadvertent yuks . 
"
"a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels . 

first , there's the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie . 

but occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery . 

no no . . . 

just kidding . 

had you going there for a moment , didn't i ? 

in all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games . 

the first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it's 5 billion inhabitants ) . 

the mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth . 

unfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance . 

the first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game . 

i'd even go so far as to say that many folks who didn't know about the game probably enjoyed the movie . 

the writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn't try to overachieve . 

there were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot . 

and , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office . 

mortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie . 

shao khan has decided that he's going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament . 

thereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid . 

one gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought "" hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now . "" 

too bad they didn't simply stick with the formula from the first movie . 

i could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points : 

 * the acting is truly bad . 

sandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) . 

 * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i've * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder . 

in the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics . 

i generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim "" tiny "" lister , jr . being cast as the president of the u . s . in the fifth element , for example ) , and remar has always been one of my favorite "" utility "" actors but he's so totally wrong for this part that he doesn't even have the luxury of amused self-awareness . 

 * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again . 

 * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) . 

for these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2 . . . 

 . . . unless you're a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie . 

in that case , the following critiques also apply : 

 * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter . 

wilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer . 

hess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene . 

 * in the fights , each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more ) . 

sonya does her "" kiss of death , "" jax does his "" earthquake , "" liu kang does his "" animality , "" and so on . 

a big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely . 

 * there aren't as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first , because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between . 

silly , silly folks . 

and the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud-wrestling match . 

lame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it . 

 * the special effects are generally better , except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their "" animalities . "" 

motaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie . 

for folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games , i give this a 5 . 

you'll probably like it , but not nearly as much as you liked the first one . 
"
"when i first saw the preview for cruel intentions , i turned to my friend and said , "" dangerous liaisons for kids ! "" 

it was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense , owing everything it is to stephen frears' 1988 masterpiece . 

imagine my surprise to see that writer/director roger kumble has given credit to his source material : choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits . 

and i was impressed . 

in fact , i was much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film , which is an appalling excuse for a movie . 

it's kiddie-porn hackwork , complete with earthy sex-talk and fully-clothed hand-jobs . 

i suppose this kind of movie was inevitable ; with all the teen high-school angst movies coming out , there was certainly room for a pretentious and laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think they're smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined . 

cruel intentions is a mess in every possible way , and it fails primarily in the way i expected it to : i hated all the characters , and i hate everything they do . 

i also hate ryan phillippe , so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be . 

phillippe plays ( check out this name ) sebastian valmont . 

wow . 

isn't that a memorable name ? 

i could just say it over and over again . 

sebastian valmont . 

it kind of rolls off the tongue , in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich . 

sebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth ; there is no woman he can't have , no material object out of his reach . 

he has all the money , all the sex -- all at his fingertips . 

and , luckily , his parents never enter into his life -- no , in the world of cruel intentions , adults don't really exist . 

the ones who do are irritating . 

sebastian valmont lives with his stepsister , kathryn merteuil ( sarah michelle gellar ) , the bitch-queen of the universe , and also the woman every man wants . 

since these two rich kids are so bored , they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons . 

kathryn wants sebastian valmont to de-virginize cecile caldwell ( selma blair ) , a naive dork-chick who has somehow wronged kathryn . 

but it's too easy for sebastian valmont -- he wants to nail annette hargrove ( reese witherspoon ) , the "" paradigm of chastity and beauty . "" 

so , sebastian valmont and kathryn make a deal ( which is too explicit to state here ) . 

but -- dear god ! 

-- sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove . 

dangerous liaisons is a great movie because the characters are all believable , and because of its masterful acting . 

cruel intentions is bad for many reasons , but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting . 

kathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch , a girl so loathsome that i would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her . 

she is supposed to be mean , but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons . 

gellar , while aesthetically pleasing , is one-dimensional and utterly repulsive . 

witherspoon has a truly beautiful face , but her character isn't the moral staple she's supposed to be : sure , she won't have sex until she's in love ( is this really a * moral * issue ? ) , but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible . 

but i can't forget mr . phillippe , who continues to exceed my expectations with his impenetrable , invulnerable blandness . 

i have to give him credit and say that he did , in fact , manage to change his facial expression about three times during the course of cruel intentions . 

and there's one point in the film in which he shouts , thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone . 

true , he is bad , but it doesn't help that he has no character to work with . 

kumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character , leaving us with a sex-crazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he falls in love with a moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch . 

the film fails in every other way , too . 

first of all , nobody talks like this . 

even the "" intellectuals "" i know don't bother with this kind of pointless and pretentious yammering . 

for a while , the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs , but it ends up taking itself so seriously that there's no way we can join it . 

cruel intentions also manages to come off as soft-porn in more than one scene . 

earlier i mentioned a fully-clothed hand-job ; this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont , both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie . 

so , if we hate them , then what's the point of an extended sex scene ? 

titillation , of course . 

it can't even work under the pretense of "" meaningful love scene , "" because we hate the characters . 

it's interesting to note some of the parallels between cruel intentions and dangerous liaisons . 

kumble is clearly familiar with the earlier film ; many of the scenes have a similar tone , and there are moments in frears' film that kumble imitates almost completely ( such as the last scene , in which [spoiler warning ! ] the antagonist is humiliated in front of her peers ) . 

but kids don't act like this . 

nobody acts like this . 

in his translation , roger kumble forgot character development and sympathy -- some pretty crucial elements . 

the result is a picture of confounding badness , a kiddie-porn mess that thinks it's really deep and profound . 

i'll give cruel intentions credit for realizing its influences , but that doesn't change the fact that it's awful . 
"
"i can't recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota . 

for forty minutes or so , i was lured into a loopy if occasionally over-wrought romantic comedy , and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt . 

then , rather suddenly , i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence ; shortly thereafter , i was whacked in the gut by another . 

feeling minnesota is a film that made me feel violated , as though i had trusted writer-director steven baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face . 

feeling minnesota tells the story of a topless dancer named freddie ( cameron diaz ) who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss red ( delroy lindo ) suspects her of stealing from him . 

red's punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper , sam clayton ( vincent d'onofrio ) , who is far from the man of freddie's dreams . 

enter jjaks ( keanu reeves ) , sam's estranged younger brother , who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddie's eye and have sex with her in the bathroom . 

united in their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of sam , jjaks and freddie take off together , but sam isn't ready to let them go without a fight . 

freddie , meanwhile , isn't ready to let sam's money go without a fight , and thus begins a series of violent confrontations . 

there is both style and substance to the beginning of feeling minnesota , as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks and sam's intense sibling rivalry as boys , and their mother ( tuesday weld ) sending jjaks away to live with his father . 

it does a great job of setting up jjaks' unstable life , a life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying to please his family ; reeves' wounded look is just right for jjaks . 

the wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments , most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin . 

most important , baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie and jjaks with humor and economy , as in a scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements' "" i will dare "" on the car radio . 

you would have every reason to expect that relationships -- both familial and romantic -- would be the focal point of feeling minnesota . 

unfortunately , you would be dead wrong . 

i suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding , but i certainly didn't expect what i got . 

what i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality , or rather creating gags about brutality . 

suddenly , the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes a story about a corpse , and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable . 

the sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another , but there is no consistency to the characterizations . 

vincent d'onofrio turns in a manic performance as sam , whose jealousy , competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks , while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction , and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood . 

there are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully ( jonathan demme's something wild and neil jordan's the crying game come to mind ) , but they didn't try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment . 

i don't want to dismiss baigelman's successes out of hand -- he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop , and some well-crafted comic moments -- and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as a light-hearted caper . 

it _is_ his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value , and that he can't make his two halves into a whole . 

feeling minnesota left me feeling used , and there's not much funny about that .

"jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the rest of the crew of the u . s . s . 

enterprise are back for their third outing in the ninth film based on the 1960's series , star trek . 

gone are kirk , spock and mccoy and in their wake in the very able and very talented cast from star trek : the next generation . 

as usual , a crisis is brewing and it is up to the crew of the enterprise to make the galaxy safe again . 

this time out the united federation of planets and an alien race led by f . murray abraham are trying to move some colonists off a planet against the colonist's will . 

it turns out that this planet is the fountain of youth and the federation and their alien buddies feel that is should be used for the good of everyone and not just a few hundred colonists . 

of course picard feels that this sort of treachery is wrong , so he disobeys direct orders and vows to help protect the colonists . 

insurrection is a lighter movie than the last two star trek films . 

the film focuses on the lofty question of whether the rights of society as a whole outweighs the rights of a small group . 

in this respect it gets back to the roots of star trek by disguising social commentary as science fiction . 

it doesn't do a bad job , other than it tries to inject too much humor into the story line . 

many of the jokes are your typical inside star trek-fan-only jokes , while many of the others just fall flat . 

the other criticism that i had with the story was that it ignores common sense . 

there are only a few hundred people on this whole planet , why do they have to be moved ? 

the explanation is that the planet has to be bombarded with deadly radiation so that this fountain of youth effect will be strong enough to help heal f . murray abraham's aliens who number only a couple of dozen . 

so the basic story line is bad enough in that we have a few hundred being booted out for a few billion , at least that's plausible . 

but in reality we have a few hundred being moved for the benefits of a few dozen , which makes no sense whatsoever . 

the other little hiccup in logic is the inclusion of worf ( michael dorn ) , the trusty klingon . 

worf was on star trek : the next generation , so they want to include him in the films . 

no problem so far . 

worf is now a character of star trek : deep space nine , so the writers have to find a way to have him show up . 

in the last star trek movie , first contact , the included worf in a credible fashion , in this one , the writers are so lazy that the completely gloss over why he is even in the movie . 

what little explanation they do give is so small that you would have missed it if you weren't hanging on every word on the screen . 

my minor problems with the movie aside , star trek : insurrection does have an overwhelming number of good points as compared to its bad ones . 

while many of the jokes do miss the mark , many are pretty good , even for non-trekkies . 

the special effects are among the best for the star trek series . 

the action is plentiful and well done . 

this is a very good-looking movie . 

it should come as no surprise to anyone who ever watched star trek : the next generation that the acting is first rate . 

it is very obvious that these actors have been working together for over a decade . 

they interact with each other with a skill that few other ensemble casts can muster . 

most star trek fans probably will not be disappointed with this latest film in the series . 

if you've always hated star trek , there is nothing here that is going to change your mind . 

star trek : insurrection is not the best film in the series , but it is good enough to dispel the long standing tradition of the odd numbered films in the series being far inferior to the even numbered ones . 
"
"don't get me wrong -- i tend to appreciate besson's naive , unashamedly romantic worldview , an artsy european sensibility gone thoroughly hollywood . 

his 1994 leon is exciting and absurdly moving , thanks mainly to the interplay between jean reno and a young natalie portman , and 1997's the fifth element is a goofy paean to love , l-u-v , that's even more of a hoot on repeated viewings . 

but his joan of arc is a mess , despite some stirring battle scenes and the mostly knockout presence of a close-cropped milla jovovich as the maiden herself . 

jovovich , besson's own personal muse through the making of his last two films ( though they've since separated ) , is magnetic and energetic enough to play a credible joan ( as long as you believe joan was not just a warrior , but also a fabulous , supermodel-level babe ) . 

and besson remains a servicable action film director , though not an especially facile one . 

leading her army against the seemingly impenetrable fortresses of the english , joan's struggle against great odds is undeniably stirring , and besson helps you understand how the french could believe , fervently , that god is on her side . 

besson's big mistake , i think , is trying to dramatize the interior life of his subject . 

yes , joan had visions -- but i guarantee that whatever image a sympathetic audience conjures in its collective mind will be more compelling than the blue-eyed christ figure on display in besson's hallucinatory dream sequences . 

the whole conceit turns into a disaster right about the time dustin hoffman ( billed as "" the conscience "" ) shows up , spouting platitudes and sending poor milla running around her cell , babbling like ally mcbeal . 

that's kind of a shame , since she does quite well up to that point , charging into battle with a banshee wail that suggests the eruption of a sublimated bloodthirstiness . 

that darkly attractive aspect of her character -- that she's as likely a charismatic madwoman as the vessel of the lord -- is more or less betrayed by the final reels , in which the conscience browbeats her over the killing she's overseen and joan starts to look like little more than a very confused young lady who's about to take a fall . 

as the story winds down , with joan condemned to a horrible death by fire , besson is aiming for tragedy and psychological significance . 

trouble is , he's chosen a lurid , often jokey tone for the balance of the picture -- including some blithe cgi bloodshed in the battle scenes -- and it's impossible to shake the feeling that this particular vision of the middle ages is , to a great extent , nothing more than a put-on . 

this glib , pre-fab version of such a great story makes me all the more grateful for dreyer's the passion of joan of arc ( 1928 ) , a film whose dialogue is drawn from the actual transcripts of joan's trial , and which stands as one of the most harrowing experiences in all of cinema . 

compared to that film , the messenger plays as a crime against history .

g wanders onto the television set and connects with the viewers by telling them that they don't really want all that commercial crap . 

in some unexplained manner , this causes sales to sour . 

ricky is saved . 

the movie tries to be too much at once and fails at it all . 

it's not an over-the-top comedy or a heart-warming message of humanity . 

it _is_ a mish-mosh of poorly directed scenes made even worse by insipid dialog . 

i am willing to put up with preaching from a film , but the messages here are old hat . 

you should take time to smell the roses . 

selling your soul for cash is a bad idea . 

golly . 

i'm glad i saw the movie . 

i never would have thought of these . 

the opportunity to poke fun at the goofy products is mostly missed . 

when g takes a chainsaw to the set , there's an obvious chance for murphy to be hilarious . 

it doesn't happen . 

the bits are so subdued and overly-long that there's only a hint of laughter from the audience . 

murphy has changed his roles in recent years and not for the better . 

there are hints of promise in this one . 

the only time the film picks up even a little is when his shaved-headed character in the long flowing white caftan shows up on screen . 

the others are horrendous . 

goldblum has episodes of brilliance in his career , but here he seems to have been replaced with a lifeless pod from his "" invasion of the body snatchers "" . 

his relationship with kate makes no sense . 

they move from antagonism to love somewhere off screen . 

preston is as uninteresting as she could possibly be . 

somewhere hidden deep inside of this film is about ten minutes of value . 

an attempt to satirize stupid television , we get a self-parody instead .

"synopsis : a small town thug convinces a dimwitted high-school student to spy on his girlfriend , who is babysitting three unruly kids for their alcoholic parents on a friday night . 

while this is going on , the thug , the father , the boyfriend , and a kid reaching the onset of puberty all have fantasies about the babysitter . 

comments : to say this movie is bad would be quite an understatement . 

i'm not sure what writer and director ferland was hoping to accomplish with the babysitter . 

suspense ? 

family drama ? 

humor ? 

erotica ? 

elements of each of these genres exist in the film , yet it fails to successfully achieve any of them . 

instead , the babysitter is a dull , lifeless movie which manages to bore and ultimately irritate its viewers . 

i suppose this film could have been watchable if it weren't for the fact that the characters are universally unappealing . 

alicia silverstone is completely wasted playing jennifer , the babysitter . 

her character has absolutely no depth at all , and her sole purpose in the movie is to be the object of the other characters' fantasies . 

everyone else in the film seems to be in a competition to see who can stoop to the lowest level by the time the film ends . 

the parents are alcoholics who become increasingly obnoxious as the movie proceeds . 

the father ( played by j . t . 

walsh ) fantasizes about the babysitter ; the mother fantasizes about her husband's best friend . 

none of these fantasy sequences , trust me , are things that need to be seen , but we see them anyway , complete with cheesy , make-out saxophone music . 

the thug , in the meantime , proves that he's evil through his annoying habit of smashing half-empty beer bottles all of a sudden and for no apparent reason . 

the most absurd character , however , is the babysitter's boyfriend who seems catatonically brain-dead . 

the thug , in a manipulative , iago-like manner ( though he doesn't really need to try hard ) , manages to talk the boyfriend into binge-drinking , smoking grass , running away from cops , and playing peeping tom on his own girlfriend in a matter of minutes . 

incredible ! 

 ( of course , the boyfriend's original plan for the evening was , try not to laugh , to sit in an empty diner and read catcher in the rye by j . d . salinger . ) 

if the goal of the babysitter was to be suspenseful , then it fails . 

there are surprisingly few tense moments in this film , and nearly all of them come at the final minute . 

by that time , however , the audience is so tired of the inane characters that no one truthfully cares what happens to any of them . 

no suspense occurs in the dream sequences either because every single one of them is obviously a dream sequence from its inception . 

if the goal of the babysitter was to be humorous , then it also fails . 

i found nothing even remotely funny about the boozing parents who seemed , at times , to be played for laughs . 

if the goal of the babysitter was to be dramatic , then , once again , it fails . 

the characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting . 

finally , if the goal of the babysitter was to be titillating ( the type of film destined to be played ad infinitum on hbo at 2 in the morning ) , then it fails as well . 

the dream sequences aren't erotic ; they are too brief and , outside of one very short scene , contain no nudity . 

i can't completely trash this movie . 

the first 10 minutes or so vaguely resemble an interesting film , and the conclusion sports a halfway decent fistfight . 

the other 79 minutes , though , are a drag . 

silverstone's character , at the end of the movie , turns to her boyfriend and asks "" what were you thinking ? "" 

i asked myself the same question , having spent 99 cents renting this turkey .

"susan granger's review of "" two can play that game "" ( screen gems ) 

since the success of "" waiting to exhale , "" there have been several romantic comedies about african-american professionals . 

this female revenge fantasy , vivica a . fox plays shante smith , a stunning ad exec who seems to have reached the pinnacle of success : a mansion , a sporty car and an idyllic relationship with a hunky , hot-shot lawyer , morris chestnut . 

she's at a point in her life when she dispenses advice to her grateful girl-friends ( mo'nique , wendy racquel robinson , tamala jones ) . 

 "" when your man messes up , no matter how small it is , "" she smugly decrees , "" yuh gots to punish him . "" 

so when she catches her hot man dancing at a bar with a smart and sexy rival , gabrielle union , she devises her own version of "" the rules , "" a 10-day "" tough love "" emotionally punishing plan to get him back . 

unfortunately , writer/director mark brown ( "" how to be a player "" ) breaks the cardinal rule of romantic comedy : you have to like the protagonist - and shrill , self-congratulatory shante smith is a smirking , superficial , spiteful shrew who doesn't realize that rational rules cannot always be applied to love . 

having her talk directly into the camera gets stale very quickly and the "" day one , "" "" day two "" title-card device underscores the tedium . 

comic anthony anderson scores as chestnut's boisterous best-friend , and singer bobby brown does a cameo as a scuzzy mechanic who's given a smooth makeover by ms . robinson . 

but the out-takes over the closing credits contain more humor than the film itself . 

on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" two can play that game "" is smarmy if slick 4 , filled with misogynistic attitude and blatant product placements ( coca-cola , miller genuine draft ) but little else . 

in this r-rated ( for explicit sexual language ) , pseudo-hip battle of the sexes , the audience loses .

"tv's buffy finds herself on the other side of the supernatural spectrum in "" simply irresistible . "" 

sarah michelle gellar , that never-ceasing crusader against never-ending evil every tuesday night on the wb network , here plays a down-on-her-luck chef suspected of dabbling in witchcraft after her flailing restaurant receives help in the form of magically scrumptious meals . 

taste test results : some vampire slaying , though out of place , would have really livened this excruciating movie up . 

 "" simply irresistible "" is actually quite easy to deny , a disaster of culinary and other proportions pretty much from the opening on . 

gellar's amanda finds herself falling for harried henri bendel exec tom ( sean patrick flannery of powder ) around the same time she discovers an uncanny ability to mystically manifest emotions in her cooking , a secret ingredient that arouses both his interest in her and the public's in her tiny tribeca eatery . 

all this love and sorcery have a lot to do with the telekinetic crab that also figures into the story , a tale that at times plays like an american spin on 1993's mexican classic "" like water for chocolate . "" 

several differences : one , "" like water "" didn't have a telekinetic crab , and two , "" like water "" was a good film . 

 "" simply irresistible , "" on the other hand , is about as challenging as an easy-bake oven . 

amateurishly staged scenes cancel each other out in their badness , from an embarrassing seduction in a literal vanilla fog to an impromptu dance sequence where tom and amanda do their best fred and ginger - though fred and ginger never took part in anything this garish . 

the intrusive musical score distracts from the flat dialogue at regular intervals , but it's not like you're were going to miss much . 

in fact , take away the few instances of salty language and this has made-for-disney channel written all over it . 

but a majority of "" simply irresistible "" 's resistibility factor has less to do with the afore-mentioned overkill than the bland leads - tom and amanda are so thin and ambiguously defined that there's just no fun rooting for their inevitable "" happily ever after . "" 

nor do the otherworldly powers that serve to bring them together make sense , so we're left with a ho-hum relationship based on enchanted eclairs ; it's not going to last long , people . 

perhaps sensing this , the filmmakers have piled on weird supporting characters for acting vets like betty buckley , dylan baker and patricia clarkson , but they don't go anywhere either . 

in fact , nothing in "" simply irresistible "" goes anywhere save for gellar , and she doesn't go somewhere so much as you wish she'd go _somewhere_ - like to a better movie . 

already proving major talent with relatively few big- and small-screen roles , she's the sole reason this overcooked souffle isn't completely fit for the garbage disposal , looking smashing in her todd oldham-designed duds and investing much more in her perfunctory part than she ever gets in return . 

it's certainly a dish best not served in it's current condition , but one can only guess that , without gellar , "" simply irresistible "" would be strictly unwatchable . 
"
"to put it bluntly , ed wood would have been proud of this . 

a totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor , hokey drama , zero logic and a crap screenplay . 

also , a beautifully anti-climactic ending . 

not to say it didn't look intriguing when i saw the previews . 

so much for truth in advertising . 

roland emmerich , who's later "" independence day "" would look like "" the 400 blows "" compared to this , co-writed and directed this inane sci-fi film which uses the cliche of there being some connection between eqypt and aliens . 

in a useless opening sequence , men find a stone in 1914 with hieroglyphics on it . 

it wouldn't be till present day ( '94 ) till they would actually figure it out . 

they're decipherer ? 

a slightly-neurotic scientist ( nice twist ) , dr . dan jackson ( james spader , doing his best outside of erotic thrillers and some indy fare ) who's life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures after the third word . 

why do they use him to decipher what no one else could ? 

so there is a hokey ending ! 

duh ! 

he figures it out in about a minute . 

yea . 

and then they get a suicidal colonel or something , "" jack "" o'neill ( kurt russel , with his wyat earp locks in the beginning then a flat-top that would make howie long snap into a fetal position ) . 

why a suicidal colonel ? 

for the ending ! 

you'll get the hang of this . 

they open the stargate , a bunch of them go through it with a bomb to blow it up if they find anything bad . 

after an overdone special effects thing , they're . . . inside a goddam pyramid . 

so they went to egypt , right ? 

wrong . 

they're on another planet that was filmed in egypt . 

they discover a cilvilization ruled by ra , the sun god ( the androginous jaye davidson , with a voice modifier to make him sound like barry white with asthma ) , and there are fights , explosions and a kiss between two people . 

yea . 

also melodrama , stupidity , hokey scenes and a bizarre language . 

an anti-climactic ending ends with stupid lines ( "" say hello to king tut , asswhole ! "" 

- the quintessential line , lemme tell ya ) and some convenient pesudo-pseudo-pseudo-character development . 

by the end , you just wanna go home and watch , i don't know , the "" outer limits "" or something . 

the script's terrible . 

the special effects are okay , but nothing great . 

the story's so weak that it's almost opaque . 

the whole experience just isn't worth it unless you're so bored that you'd consider watching a "" full house "" marathon . . . or 

this . 

i'd pick this , obviously , but still , it's just not fun at all . 

and i can't wait for it to premier on mst3k .

"i'm really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone . 

sure , she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god's green earth ( second only to that movie critic at large guy ) , but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in , she always strikes out . 

the crush was a slow-moving , predictable piece of fluff . 

hideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in . 

clueless was an annoying , unfunny waste of time . 

and people have e-mailed me too , saying clueless is a good movie and that i'm the only one who doesn't like it . 

one girl said if i'd seen the movie with "" an open mind , "" i would have enjoyed it . 

nothing could be further from the truth . 

i went into the theater expecting to love the movie . 

the preview looked good and of course i'm crazymadinlove with alicia , but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny , unlikable characters . 

almost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way . 

when we were walking out of the theater , one guy ( and it wasn't me ) yelled out , "" that was the worst f$&#in' movie i've ever seen "" and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement . 

so last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia's pretty face on the cover of some made-for-video thriller called the babysitter . 

i knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i'll probably never understand made me rent it anyway . 

what i got was 90 minutes of regret--the worst alicia silverstone movie ever . 

and you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like . 

where to begin in criticizing this movie ? 

the plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier , the writing could have been done ( and for all we know it was ) by a ten year old , alicia is the star and she's still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever . 

there is zero humor , zero suspense , zero drama and zero action , until the last ten minutes , when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence . 

zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero . 

so why does this movie get one star out of me ? 

well , alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub . 

and if it wasn't bubble bath , the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four- star features , but you settle for what you can get . 

alicia plays a babysitter who's spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party . 

and of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home ( at least that movie critic at large guy does ) . 

as the movie trods along , we discover she's not only the mostly-silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character's fantasies ( and probably every male viewer's too ) . 

the drunken father thinks she's just the thing to recapture his lost youth , her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside , even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she's taking her bubble bath . 

they even throw in the middle aged wife's fantasies about a male counterpart at the party . 

not that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200+ pound woman in a black silk teddy . 

at least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg-rated . 

in fact , i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late-night staple if not for the fact that there's absolutely no nudity in it . 

so you can't call it a sex flick . 

i've already pointed out that it can't fall under drama , comedy , thriller or action , so what do you classify the babysitter as ? 

bad . 
"
"it's an interesting premise . 

our reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real . 

in truth , our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains . 

what we see , what we do , everything around us is nothing more than a computer-generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence . 

our bodies , severely atrophied , are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet . 

the sci-fi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along . 

the matrix isn't it - the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network , a sham world , the ability to plug one's brain into a computer , has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator , dark city , and a few star trek episodes ( both classic and next generation ) . 

what is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thought-provoking . 

keanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo , who is plucked out of the artificial world ( known as the matrix ) by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computer-generated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines . 

the group's leader , morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) , has chosen neo because he believes neo is "" the one "" who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence . 

>from the beginning of the film , we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out . 

this , in a lesser movie would be annoying , but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun . 

what is reality ? 

what is a sham ? 

the film turns our very perception of life on its side . 

more than once , we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality , or live a life of relative bliss , oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings . 

as viewers , this is intriguing enough , so imagine what it would be like for neo . 

and who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves ? 

reeves , whom i've never really cared for as an actor , is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness , and little subtlety . 

he was good in speed , for example , but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds . 

neo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely , so much of my expectation was happily for naught . 

in a couple of places , the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature , and this is a heavy credit to writers/directors andy and larry wachowski . 

i mean , since bill and ted's excellent adventure , what movie could you say really "" utilized "" keanu reeves ? 

more interesting than reeves is fishburne , who's morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions , and convincingly so . 

very surprising for a sci-fi movie . 

fishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout , as if he always knows what to expect . 

this helps to further the aura of his character's proficiency and extensive knowledge . 

hugo weaving as agent smith , one of the artificial intelligence's anti-intruder programs , is also good playing his deadpan , no-nonsense , kick ass role , which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time . 

unfortunately , when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row , the nature of his character's speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive . 

carrie-anne moss plays trinity , morpheus's number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo . 

although her character is somewhat inconsistent , moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isn't in the picture . 

there were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects . 

many methods of imagery are employed , from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics . 

of special note is the use of the "" freeze and turn "" effect where the entire scene is frozen , turned , then continued from a new angle . 

this is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semi-circle , with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends . 

the motion cameras film the action , and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once . 

place each still image in a film sequence and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second . 

pretty slick . 

the matrix drips with style . 

from the clothing to the music to the action , we're watching an exaggerated version of what we're used to . 

much of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film - there's a lot of kung fu , there's a lot of gunplay . 

when a character is letting go with an automatic weapon , much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion . 

there's also the element of the japanese action cartoon ( called anime by aficionados ) , especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects . 

combined , it's really like no live-action film i have ever seen . 

the film is not without its faults . 

some of the scenes and ideas are "" borrowed "" a little too liberally from other films , and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing . 

some of the lines are also pretty bad - in one instance , a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying , and it wasn't meant to be a joke . 

however , these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action sci-fi film that for once does more than merely entertain . 
"
"violence is bad . 

violence is ugly . 

violence breeds yet more violence . 

kids , don't try this at home . 

this weighty message isn't the only barrier to enjoying brother , but it's certainly one of the largest . 

written , directed by , and starring the infamous takeshi kitano ( kikujiro , sonatine ) brother is his first film made outside his familial japan , bringing the yakuza tradition to los angeles . 

 ( yakuza translated for the average american is the japanese mafia . ) 

if you piss a "" family "" member off , or dishonor yourself in any way , the usual punishment is public display of self-mutilation , usually resulting in the loss of limbs . 

a definition of dishonor can be anything from making a stupid decision to leaving one family for another . 

it would be interesting to know more about where these and other customs come from . 

unfortunately the film doesn't give too much of an explanation , assuming its audience is aware of kitano's earlier work . 

there are several shots that focus specifically on detailed tattoos that spread across the entire back of the yakuza members , leading one to assume they would be symbolic of something , but you never know what . 

then there's a scene in which a man kills himself in front of a rival in exchange for that rival joining the family . 

granted , this is one of the best scenes in the movie , but it doesn't make a lot of sense . 

instead , the two hours are basically spent watching the following : people go out and shoot each other , talk about it for ten-plus minutes , then go out and do it again . 

the consistently repetitive discussion of territory during these moments involuntarily provokes yawning . 

there are also plot details thrown in for no identifiable purpose . 

all of the sudden yamamoto ( kitano ) has a girlfriend . 

he barely speaks to her , treats her like crap , and then sends her away . 

another missed opportunity , considering it is such a big deal for kitano to bring his magic to the united states , is the combination of cultures , which rely too heavily on overused stereotypes . 

though slow moving , brother does have good elements . 

the action scenes are well directed , clearly defined , and interesting to watch . 

some of the violence is more hinted at than shown , which produces the luscious squirm that one goes to see such films for . 

the actors would be more enticing if they had more to do . 

shirase's ( masaya kato ) loud , sarcastic coolness set against yamamoto's quietly threatening attitude is truly an entertaining combination . 

their moments together or apart steal the rest of the show . 

also to its credit , brother tackles the cause and effect of crime with realism . 

a life of crime is easy to get sucked into with the first reward of quick cash . 

sure people get rich , but they can also lose just as easily . 

it's a great moral , with a great cast , just not much substance to back it up . 
"
"there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have , but they chose not to take advantage of this for some personal reason . 

 "" good will hunting "" is about one of those people . 

the will hunting of the ( horrible ) title ( let's face it , this film would be a bitch to title ) , played by co-writer matt damon , is a mathematical genius . 

he can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it takes to brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino . 

and he works at mit . . . as the janitor . 

one day , the professor of one of the most challenging courses , proffessor lambeau ( "" breaking the waves "" 's stellan skarsg ? rd ) , puts a big problem on the board for his students to attempt to complete . 

the next day , it's already done on the board , but no one in his class claims to have done it . 

so lambeau puts another problem on the board , this time one that took he and his colleagues over two years to prove . 

and , duh , it's done again . 

of course , they catch the guy who did it red handed - will . 

before lambeau can find will again ( he ran away when he caught him ) , will has gotten into a fight with a bunch of punks on a basketball court , and struck a police officer , so lambeau gets him out on probation with two agreements : a ) he work with him on math , and b ) he get some therapy . 

after going through some therapists whom he psyches out in one way or another ( for a hypnotist , he fakes being under his spell , then launches into an impromptu performance of the 70s classic , "" afternoon delight "" ) . 

finally , lambeau's old college roomate , sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , a psych professor , agrees to treat him , and the two begin a rocky relationship , as sean tries to get will to open up . 

turns out will had a rough childhood , being abandoned , and placed in foster homes and what not . 

it also turns out that will does not want to do simple mathematics all his life ; he wants a challenge . 

and that is to hang out with his buds ( including the other co-writer , ben affleck ) , and do honorable jobs , like construction . 

is it right to make this genius follow in the footsteps of einstein and kasinsky ? 

should this guy be forced to do something he doesn't want to do ? 

this appears to be one of the million questions in this film , which is jam-packed with greatness , but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should . 

i'm not saying "" good will hunting "" is a bad film at all . 

it's a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments , and lots of great things about it . 

the acting is amazing , with two oscar-nomination-worthy performances from damon and williams , who have amazing chemistry together . 

we also get some great support from stellan skarsg ? rd ( great name ) , ben affleck , and from minnie driver , who plays will's love interest , skylar . 

there are tons of individual moments that i adored . 

i loved all the comedy in the film , especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks , his various attempts at therapy , and of course , my favorite scene in the entire film , the one where he delivers a long , exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them . 

i liked the relationship between some of the people , like will and skylar , will and sean , sean and lambeau , and will and his friends . 

there are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch . 

and there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal , that i felt rightfully uncomfortable . 

like the break-up scene between will and skylar , will and sean's first meeting , a bar scene between sean and lambeau , and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn't regret meeting his first wife , who would later suffer a slow , painful death , and leave him lonely and slightly bitter . 

however , the main flaw of the film is there's too much of everything , and not enough of it either . 

the film tries for deeper relations between the characters , but they're sometimes either overwritten or underwritten . 

take for example the relationship between sean and will : the film gets an interesting father/son as well as doctor/patient relationship going with out any problems , but when it tries to show them as equals , it falls on its face . 

we hear how they went to the same town , and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times . 

but this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do . 

also , will's relationship with his best friend , chuckie ( affleck ) , has a nice climax , but not enough rising action . 

we see them joking around , but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them , it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one . 

their relationship never goes beyond "" just best friends , "" and his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something more . . . human . 

maybe it was just me . 

and it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau , but that , again , is underwritten . 

and , of course , as in most films like this , the girl/boy relationship is pretty underwritten . 

we never understand what they see in each other , so when skylar confesses that she loves him , it seems more like it's there for plot details that anything else . 

minnie driver is interesting , though , and breathes life into her character . 

the writing is a bit at fault here , but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness . 

sure , it feels overstuffed , but it's extremely enjoyable . 

the dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh , and seems extremely human . 

i think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue , which is amazing . 

while this is probably director gus van sant's most conservative film ( you'd hardly know it's the same director of "" to die for , "" the only van sant film i've seen , really ) , it's still a pretty remarkable film , albeit a tad overrated ( what's this "" best picture "" deal ? ) . 

and if a film puts a smile on my face despite posessing a lot of flaws , i have no problem with reccomending it to anyone . 
"
"capsule : where are you tonight , leni rienfenstal ? 

starship troopers is an expensive , hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography -- and bad pornography , at that . 

it is not good cinema , not good storytelling , and not even stupid fun : it's so cynically , calculatedly bone-headed that even the least demanding members of the audience i was with were alternately bored and revulsed . 

it's one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time . 

why am i calling this movie pornography ? 

pornography , in the abstract , is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts . 

i remember reading a review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movie , where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper , as "" a near-pornographic eternity "" . 

i didn't agree with that assessment , but i could see what was being implied : the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout "" do 'er , man , do 'er ! "" 

that sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers . 

it's * literally * like a giant recruitment film that has gone berserk . 

it tries frantically to enlist our emotions but it winds up only being dull or sickening . 

the film takes place in our future , when earth has come under attack by some alien species that doesn't appear to have intelligence . 

to counterattack , humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable : instead of nuke the planet from orbit , which they're clearly capable of , they send down grunts with m-16 rifles . 

this isn't heinlein , it's a bad wwii movie , one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scenes that are noisy , repetitive , and ultimately tiresome . 

 ( one scene has a journalist on a battlefield , filimg soldiers being slaughtered , and ends with groaning predictability : said cameraman gets skewered , too . ) 

the soldiers and their commanders are consistently idiotic . 

they do not possess a germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense . 

they don't even behave like soldiers in a bad * movie * , and therefore we don't care about them . 

we hated the tom berenger character in platoon , but he * mattered * , and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate . 

here , we don't even hate the bugs -- what's there to hate ? 

hating them would be like cursing a hurricaine . 

if there's anything really hateful there , the movie doesn't know how to give it to us . 

the screenwriter ( ed neumeier -- perhaps a better appelation would be "" screen typist "" ) and director ( the increasingly talent-impaired paul verhoeven ) have not found any way to make the characters or the story serve each other . 

one of the subplots concerns a woman pilot who's great at getting out of tight situations , and does it again and again and again . 

once or twice is fine . 

by the fifth or sixth time , it's worn out its welcome . 

there's never any sense that these people are really thinking their way out of anything , or really being tested to show their mettle . 

also , the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry . 

if a bug has one of the humans screaming in its grasp , then five guys can stand around it and blast away on full auto without doing a damned thing . 

but if one human gets cornered , he lays waste to whole platoons of bugs with one clip . 

uh-huh . 

the very worst feature of the movie is its repulsive quasi-fascist flavor . 

i say "" quasi- "" because while the movie uses many of the trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action -- the gear , the uniforms , etc . -- the movie doesn't have the nerve ( or the brains ) to be genuinely fascist , or intelligent about the subject . 

the bumpers between scenes , which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda -- just so clumsy and oafish that they wind up making the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparison . 

like the rest of the movie . 

there's more , i suppose , but it's not worth it . 

the acting is bland , neither arsenic nor gravy ; the music disposable ; the camerawork turgid . 

the heartbreaking thing is that it makes independence day look like a masterpiece .

"bad . bad . 

bad . 

that one word seems to pretty much sums up beyond the valley of the dolls . 

if that summary isn't enough for you , how about t&a , t&a , t&a ? 

still haven't got the point ? 

other than director russ meyer's predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the afore-mentioned anatomical areas , there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie . 

that is the fact that it was co-written by famed film critic roger ebert , who also was responsible for the screenplay . 

after watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face . 

this movie stinks out loud . 

quite frankly , this movie deserves a . 

but there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny . 

so i'm giving it a . 

and maybe that is too generous . 

right from the opening credits , i knew that i had a class-a bomb on my hands . 

not only are the way the credits actually shot distracting , but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform . 

i had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening ( it does get explained later ) and as soon as the first scene is over , we cut to a completely unrelated scene . 

to be honest , as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was , i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film . 

with the quality of the writing during the rest of the film , it wouldn't have surprised me if the opening had never been explained . 

so what is this movie about ? 

you ask . 

like it really matters . 

ok , here goes . 

this all-girl band headed by kelly macnamara ( dolly reed ) and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry . 

once there , they do manage to find success ( due as much to their hooters as anything else ? it sure wasn't for their brutally bad singing voices ) , and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them . 

everything from big egos , to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral . 

there are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure , but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing . 

>from a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here . 

other than the above-mentioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have . 

the dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts . 

mr . ebert has generously thrown in helpings of "" hey man "" , "" dig "" and my all time favorite -- "" this is my happening , and it freaks me out "" . 

now i ask you , with lines like that how can you go wrong ? 

ebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue . 

maybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter . 

i don't know , but all the big words in the world wouldn't be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting . 

but the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie . 

i've seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey . 

in fact , there is one scene -- the one in which they are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes -- during which i really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries . 

add to the directing and writing the music in this movie . 

i almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken , there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers . 

then we have the cast . 

first lets start david gurian who played harris , the manager of the band . 

this has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera . 

sadly , his acting doesn't come close to making up for his looks . 

if you have been following along up to this point , this shouldn't surprise you . 

meyer's stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with their other assets . 

dolly reed plays kelly , the leader of the band . 

and no surprise here , she was cast for her cup size , not her talents . 

and yes , she does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents . 

sadly , her ass is almost as large as her chest . 

hey , it a sexist movie , so i'm writing a sexist review . 

then we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey , one of the other band members . 

this goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie . 

meyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all , but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all . 

sure russ , now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows . 

on the up side , she does have a fun lesbo scene . 

i sound like i'm writing a review in a porn magazine . 

but hey , i'll admit it ; the only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at cynthia myers naked . 

and since that was a huge disappointment , i pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey . 

the only thing that i can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it . 

unless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too . 

and if you are thinking of checking it out for the double d's -- you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet . 

this is a movie that should be avoided at all costs . 

an even better idea might be to require video stores to place a warning on the box of beyond the valley of the dolls -- beware : this movie is extremely hazardous to your common sense . 

proceed with extreme caution .

"in this re-make of the 1954 japanese monster film , godzilla is transformed into a "" jurassic park "" copy who swims from the south pacific to new york for no real reason and trashes the town . 

although some of the destruction is entertaining for a while , it gets old fast . 

the film often makes no sense ( a several-hundred foot tall beast hides in subway tunnels ) , sports second-rate effects ( the baby godzillas seem to be one computer effect multiplied on the screen ) , lame jokes ( mayor ebert and his assistant gene are never funny ) , horrendous acting ( even matthew broderick is dull ) and an unbelievable love story ( why would anyone want to get back together with maria pitillo's character ? ) . 

there are other elements of the film that fall flat , but going on would just be a waste of good words . 

only for die-hard creature feature fans , this might be fun if you could check your brain at the door . 

i couldn't .

" "" mercury rising "" has numerous flaws , but there is one that really stands out : its central plot device is unnecessary . 

that's right . 

the major aspect of the film , that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy / action flicks could be dropped from the beginning , and the movie would turn out exactly the same , if not better . 

this central device is the fact that a nine-year-old boy is autistic . 

his name is simon , and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it . 

simon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film , and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent , unfair world against his will , with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him . 

the fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of "" mercury rising . "" 

i suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon's character and his relationship with willis , but here it is lost . 

miko hughes , the young actor who plays simon , goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic : he walks slowly , drawls his words , kicks and screams when he's touched , and has a hard time looking at other people . 

it's a difficult role for an adult , much less a young child , to play , and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn't playing like he's autistic . 

unlike dustin hoffman's performance in "" rain man "" or leonardo dicaprio's in "" what's eating gilbert grape , "" we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting . 

however , unlike "" rain man "" which used its character's autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story , "" mercury rising "" could go right about its generic , predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid . 

hell , he doesn't even have to be shy . 

in fact , the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role , rather than just being carted around under willis' arm . 

willis' character , art jeffries , is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything . 

he becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simon's house , where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide . 

of course , we know that isn't the way it happened happen because we saw an evil , square-jawed government hitman with a mean-looking crew-cut knock off the parents . 

simon was able to get away , and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet , which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked . 

jeffries -- who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it -- knows there is something more , and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon . 

this is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simon's parents is crawling everywhere , attempting to kill simon at the hospital , on the highway , and every other place he goes . 

late in the movie , jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey ( kim dickens ) who he meets at a coffee shop . 

of all the hard-to-believe aspects of the movie , this is the worst . 

i can believe in the decency of the human heart , but stacey's character is far too accommodating . 

not only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery , she lets him into her apartment at two o'clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him , and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent . 

the grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point . 

the movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences , but even here "" mercury rising "" doesn't rise to the challenge . 

the movie was directed by harold becker , who has made some good suspense films including "" sea of love "" ( 1989 ) and "" malice "" ( 1993 ) , but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion . 

there is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman ( played by peter stormare ) that is so ineptly directed , shot and edited , that i had no idea 1 ) exactly where they were on the streetcar , 2 ) who was hitting who , and 3 ) where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were . 

the grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building , and features a harrowing ( yawn ) scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building , not because he has to , but because it's more suspenseful that way . 

taken as a whole , "" mercury rising "" is an tepid , confused movie that lacks style , wit , and any traces of a sense of humor . 

usually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles , but here he is too straight and serious . 

this is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time , but it ends up failing on both fronts . 

maybe the book was better , but the way it's handled here is a perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore .

can fire-taming be far be that far behind for the ever-smoldering sonia ?

"the coen brothers are back again , this time with homer's "" odyssey "" as the backdrop in their tale of three fugitives from a mississippi chain gang who trek across the south to find a secret treasure in "" o brother , where art thou ? "" 

right for the beginning of "" o brother "" the coens grab your attention with a chain gang of prison inmates breaking rocks along the road in unison to a work song . 

the camera flows around the hard toiling men , giving a visually exciting symmetry to the scene that ends with our three heroes - ulysses everett mcgill ( george clooney ) , delmar ( tim blake nelson ) and pete ( john turturro ) - escaping across a cotton field . 

it is the beginning of a journey that takes on different meanings and urgencies to each member of the trio . 

a strong suite , as always with the coen brothers , is the depth of character of the folks they create in their films . 

their characters are goofy and comical , like nicolas cage in "" raising arizona "" ; or , dramatic , as albert finney and john turturro in "" miller's crossing "" ; and , even a mix of the two with frances mcdormand in "" fargo . "" 

in all cases , and in "" o brother , "" too , the characters populating their films are three-dimensional people . 

ulysses everett is a handsome , hair-obsessed petty criminal with a silver tongue and not a lot in the brains department . 

but , he seems like a genius when compared to the simple , sweet delmar and the maladjusted pete , who follow their self appointed leader to a promised treasure of $1 . 2 million . 

their odyssey takes on the mystical proportions of homer's original material as they meet all manner of people along the way , including those dangerous sirens who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoals and a cyclops who beats them and takes all their money . 

there is magic , too , when delmar believes that pete was turned into a horny toad by the sirens . 

the story meanders through the different vignettes of the boys' adventures , giving the flick a choppy , episodic feel that disrupts the overall flow . 

some of the interludes are an epiphany , though . 

the trio becomes a quartet when they pick up guitar-playing tommy johnson ( chris thomas king ) and visit a radio station in the middle of nowhere , run by its blind owner ( stephen root ) . 

they become the soggy bottom boys for the sightless radio station man and , without their knowledge , are recorded as they sing the traditional tune , "" i am a man of constant sorrow . "" 

it is a wonderful moment of moviemaking and gives us , in my mind , the best movie song of the year . 

contrasting this and other wonderful moments ( the sexy seduction by the sirens comes to mind ) are some pretentious bits that detract from the overall quality of "" o brother . "" 

in particular , near the end , is a scene where ulysses , delmar and pete crash a ku klux klan rally to save tommy from being lynched . 

the scene is overblown and flashy and reeks of "" the wizard of oz . "" 

they don't say "" lions and tigers and bears , oh my ! "" 

and there's no dorothy , but it is the land of oz we're seeing here . 

the highs and lows of the story flow are tempered by fine acting on several levels . 

george clooney is funny , charming , a little dumb and one of the handsomest actors in the business today . 

he has the charm of a 30's movie idol and is able to put himself into silly situations with dignity . 

ulysses has an ongoing obsession with his hair , risking life and limb to get a particular brand of pomade and a supply of hairnets . 

his vanity will come to plague him as it would any mystical hero-wanderer . 

while clooney is the name draw for "" o brother , "" the show stealer is tim blake nelson as delmar . 

the heretofore unknown nelson is terrific as the simple convict who , at one point , hears the word of the lord and joins members of a church congregation in their mass baptism . 

delmar is saved and dedicates his life to doing good and provides a richness to his simple character that makes him shine . 

the taciturn pete , as played by longtime coen collaborator turturro , is the sullen member of the trio and gives them the necessary angst . 

all together , the tuneful triumvirate is a mix of the three stooges and the three musketeers as they prove to be buffoons , albeit brave ones . 

the colorful supporting cast is rampant with homerian characters to meet and get to know along the way of the boys' odyssey . 

charles durning appears as incumbent governor pappy o'daniel , who keeps crossing paths with them in his bid for re-election . 

john goodman is wicked as the one-eyed bible salesman and con artist , big dan teague . 

michael badalucco is manic and outrageous as outlaw and bank robber extraordinary , george "" babyface "" nelson . 

stephen root is amusing as the blind dj , rep'ing one of the many references to the sightless that abound in the film in mystical ways . 

holly hunter is wasted in the small role as ulysses' estranged wife , penny ( and the real reason for this adventure , not secret treasure ) . 

techs are , as expected in a coen brothers venture , first class . 

cinematographer roger deakins , who has worked on five previous coen films , captures the sultry atmosphere of the south . 

the photography complements the lush period production and costume provided by dennis gassner and mary zophres , respectively . 

once again , roderick jaynes - the alter ego of ethan and joel coen - is on board as editor . 

the high points outweigh the low through most of "" o brother , where art thou ? "" 

with particular praise for the wonderful selection of period and traditional music .

"synopsis : sonny koufax ( adam sandler ) is a rich , childish , angry man who has just been dumped by his girlfriend vanessa ( kristy swanson ) . 

in a bid to impress vanessa sonny impersonates his friend kevin ( jon stewart ) and adopts a 5 year old boy named julian ( cole and dylan sprouse ) while kevin is on an overseas trip . 

under sonny's supervision julian soon learns to lie to women , tell people how he "" wipes his ass , "" throw tantrums , and scream for his "" god damned "" treats . 

self centered , julian breaks a school classmate's arm without apologizing or even realizing he has done anything wrong . 

meanwhile sonny bribes julian with sugary talk , food , toys , and flashy promises in order to get the kid to perform . 

not surprisingly the government takes julian away from sonny's incompetent supervision , and this leads to a custody battle . 

opinion : it's a movie about an embittered creep teaching a little kid to be a jerk , and we all get cheap laughs because for 90 minutes the innocent kindergartner never finds out what it means when he mimics all the bad boy behavior . 

that's the essence of big daddy . 

but there's a bigger issue involved : marketing . 

movies that are rated pg and pg-13 are heavily marketed towards children of preteen age and below . 

on tv , film clips advertise these movies as family-friendly hit comedies . 

then when you go see them they turn out to be either raunchy sex acts like austin powers with characters named fat bastard - - or big daddy where adult characters get their jollies by buddying up to naive five year olds and encouraging them to experiment with drugs and mistreatment . 

folks in hollywood are trying to develop a preteen market for raunchy stuff , but i think most american parents would agree that early childhood is a time of mental innocence that should be protected from uncaring media market exploitation . 

to many american mothers there's probably nothing more pathetic and unsettling than the sight of a theater full of unsupervised little eight year olds laughing raucously as movie character father adam sandler jokes about a woman's "" ice cold tits . "" 
"
"earth is a harsh , unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent . 

people who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict , as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets : indian and pakistani ; muslim , hindu , sikh , parsee . 

the story takes place in lahore , which was indian before partition , and pakistani afterward , regardless of what its citizens might call themselves . 

the action is seen through the eyes of lenny ( maaia sethna ) , a young parsee girl , but it is really about her nanny , shanta . 

shanta has a small circle of male admirers . 

two of the men are suitors : hasan ( rahul khanna ) , a hindu , and dil navaz ( aamir khan ) , a muslim . 

the others--sikh , hindu , muslim--are older ; some are married ; but all appreciate shanta , who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das . 

 ( she also starred in deepa mehta's previous film , fire , the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water . ) 

in an early scene , the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny ; political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears . 

one of the men remarks , jokingly , that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along . 

he is wrong : the men make barbed little comments to each other , spoken like jokes , but with an undercurrent of fanaticism . 

the tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses . 

it is easy to perceive , in these squabbles , the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter . 

the group around shanta represents , in a sense , a united india , and shanta herself the ideal motherland--one which all love , which inspires hindu , muslim , and sikh to live peacably together . 

but the circle around shanta is sundered , as is the state . 

a sikh is persecuted , hides , then flees . 

another man is murdered . 

the group of friends will not meet again . 

the movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction : a plate shattered on the floor , a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child , and , most brutally , when the tension escalates into violence , a man is held down , tied between two cars , and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles . 

it is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully . 

the crux of earth's plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz . 

his sisters are killed in brutal fashion , by hindus , because they are muslim . 

dil navaz seeks solace from shanta , and asks in desperation that she marry him . 

but she loves hasan , and tenderly refuses dil navaz's offer . 

the combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him , and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality : the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate . 

despite the things he later does , it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him , but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things . 

the conclusion--the consequence of dil navaz's transformation--is rather abrupt . 

the story earth tells does not end . 

it just stops . 

it is an appropriate finish : giving us closure would have imparted , at least on an aesthetic level , a sense of resolution , of satisfaction . 

but there was no resolution for india and pakistan--they have been at war , on a small or large scale , for decades . 

since the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation , it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus . 

there is no healing to be had , no closure , on any level ( despite the needless , tacked-on ending , with voice-over narration from lenny as an adult , framing the story ) . 

earth is , in some ways , an unexceptional movie . 

it does not reinvent the wheel , following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas . 

but deepa mehta's directon is assured , and the issues she addresses run deep . 

earth does for india what movies like zhang yimou's to live and tian zhuangzhuang's the blue kite did for china : they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history . 

such films strike me as inherently valuable , even when flawed . 

they may be biased or inaccurate , but they bear the weight of human hardship , and this confers on them a nobility and gravity which other , more inventive films , often lack . 

it is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries : the events shown may have happened decades ago , but they still touch a nerve . 

the issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year . 

in the near future , india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other . 

at the time of the tests i had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen ; after seeing earth , i have a much , much better understanding .

"i recall the trials and tribulations of my high school years . 

it was a period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood and thrust me into the unwelcome arms of adulthood . 

but of all the experiences that i collected throughout those tender years , i can honestly say that the toughest and the scariest thing that i had to cope with was my raging hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex . 

yes , more scarier than my seventh grade english teacher and even scarier than the bullies that constantly hounded me , trying to deal with my personal wonderment about sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster . 

for all teenagers , it's almost like a rite of passage . 

and what we did was sometimes downright nasty , sometimes funny , and sometimes shocking . 

and all of that is terrifically and shamelessly brought to light in what might be the funniest movie this summer . 

`american pie' is a comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that enter into a pact to lose their virginity by the end of the school year . 

just how great are their hormones raging ? 

one of them notes , after watching disney's the little mermaid , that ariel is soooo hot . 

the four schoolmates are kevin , oz , finch and jim . 

kevin is the only one with a steady girlfriend , but doesn't want to have sex until the time is just right . 

but what is the perfect time ? 

there is just no way to know , and that frightens him . 

oz is the big jock who decides that the way to score with the girls is to listen to them and to be more sensitive . 

he joins up with a jazz choir and discovers that getting in touch with his feminine side has some tremendous advantages . 

finch is the phobic hermit who doesn't stand a chance with any girl . 

so , he pays someone $200 to start spreading rumors about his prowess . 

suddenly , girls are lining up to go out with him . 

but among these friends , it is jim that is the most curious and the most fearful . 

when he has a chance to romp with a pretty exchange student , his inexperience comes shining through . 

he has much to learn , and will do anything to seek out this kind of knowledge . 

this may include watching scrambled porn channels or experimenting with mom's apple pie in a scene that is completely shocking , raunchy , yet unbelievably funny . 

the one thing that i want to say about this film is that it well deserves its `r' rating . 

there is stuff in here that is completely gross in the same manner that `there's something about mary' was gloriously ribald . 

in fact , at first this film received a sinful nc-17 rating before a couple of more cuts finally brought it down to a teen-accessible rating . 

but i guess after seeing the no-holds-barred coarseness of south park , this seems tame by comparison . 

teens and anyone who can still remember their acne years are the ones that will laugh hardest . 

but unlike many teen sex comedies , there is a genuine intelligence at work here . 

these are four normal boys who have a natural curiosity about sex . 

their plans of action are thoughtful and they think about the consequences . 

they know what they want , yet temper it with responsibility . 

but almost always , it's impossible to know how to fight the invisible monster , and it's these episodes that make `american pie' such a carnal delight to watch .

"james jones , one of the major novelists from the middle of the twentieth century , has written a number of fictional works about the effects of war on the individual . 

a veteran of world war ii , and a witness to the pearl harbor bombings , his novels are not only grounded in realism but poetic in nature . 

they are reminiscent of stephen crane in their blunt eloquence , a trait which lends itself to razor-sharp focus . 

but perhaps none matches the scope of his autobiographical novel , the thin red line ; now a cinematic masterpiece from director terrence malick . 

the book's principal cast , some thirty characters , has been trimmed down for this rendition , but it still retains its most endearing value . 

each of the roles has an everyman quality , emphasizing jones' examination of world war ii on the american soldier . 

there's a definitive chain of command present , and this also plays on the motivations of the cast . 

but most importantly , and perhaps intrinsic to the novel but not to the movie , a dynamic and effective voice-over is used . 

malick has several characters relating their thoughts , giving the viewer a greater perspective of the issues at stake . 

the issues at stake are many and one . 

told from a limited third-person perspective ( as opposed to a top-down , omniscient view ) , the movie entails the struggle of an american infantry company ( "" c-for-charlie "" ) to take a hill during the conflict at guadalcanal . 

the south pacific island is seen by the top brass as the key position for american armed forces to hold if they want to win the war . 

and want to win the war they do . 

in an excellent performance , nick nolte plays c-for-charlie's commanding officer , lt . col . gordon tall . 

he's an aging soldier who embodies the win-at-all-costs mentality , if only to impress his superior ( john travolta , in a questionable cameo ) . 

this philosophy is opposite that of captain bugger staros ( elias koteas ) , who dearly values the life of each and every one of the men under his command . 

at the front are the privates and corporals ( adrien brody , james caviezel , ben chaplin , et al ) , lead by 1st sgt . 

welsh ( sean penn ) , who must actually execute the suicide orders handed down to them . 

the thin red line is filled with intense , visual poetry , but it's nearly three hours long . 

although the interest level is high throughout the first two hours , the climax comes forty-five minutes before the end of the movie ; it goes without saying that the movie drags on the back end . 

the thin red line will doubtless be compared to 1998's other masterpiece of war , saving private ryan a countless number of times . 

but to do so is to belittle both films , for although similarities abound , so do differences . 

director malick has a story to tell , and for those interested in listening , this can be a very outstanding movie . 
"
" "" soldier "" , by director paul anderson , is a film in which any presence of originality is fleeting . 

the best moments of the film are in the opning scenes where kurt russel's character todd is shown growing up under strict military supervision . 

brutality through the eyes of the innocent and stripped of it every single day growing up is something that has a lot of emotional potential power behind it , and the opening scenes tap into it a little . 

then it goes nowhere with that idea . 

there is perhaps one rather fleeting scene afterwards that deals with the potential trauma of this dehumanization , and the rest of the film is just some of the biggest action movie cliches i've ever seen . 

the whole idea of the inhuman , soldier-type character gaining some degree of humanity by defending a potential female love interest and family from his evil counterpart out to kill her is done , and it's been done much better . 

i was able to predict the plot of the _whole_ story , which wouldn't be so bad if other aspect of the film somewhat interesting . 

between the action sequences , it tries to deal with the aforementioned issues of humanity through the performance of mr . russel in the film and the tiny little window to his soul that is his eyes , since his dialog is extremely limited . 

his performance in that way isn't all that bad , but certainly is not enough to carry this film . 

other performances in this film are really not worth much mention at all , and they generally are about as weak as their characters . 

but enough of this stuff about plot and character , right ? 

isn't the most important part of an action film , well , the action ? 

even in this aspect the film is a disappointment . 

in mortal kombat ( 1995 ) , director paul anderson proved that truly engaging use and choreography of action in a film can override problems with plot and produce something entertaining . 

however , he fails to repeat that in this film . 

the combat scenes , particularly the big one at the end , is incredibly unimaginatve . 

fighting and combat scenes are supposed to bring about thrills in this type of movie , a point which even an otherwise unimpressive film like starship troopers seemed to realize . 

but instead of reaching for something truly interesting to end the film with , it goes for the old , shoot-em up , one guy vs . an army type of cinema that i thought died with the military action films of the 80s . 

if the film went with some of the ideas it opened up with the introduction more seriously , it could have been a rather engaging science fiction film . 

however , it utterly failed to go in any new directions after that , making the film a big disappointment . 
"
"one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel . 

that concept , although many purists doubt its scientific credentials , spawned many interesting novels , comic books and films in the last century . 

however , the big grand-daddy of time travels , h . g . wells' novel the time machine , wasn't written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences . 

the author , h . g . wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich , idle capitalist class and impoverished labour . 

whatever intentions wells had , the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages . 

instead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space . 

the novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration . 

first of them was george pal , who in 1960 directed film which would , through the years , become genre classic of its own . 

the plot revolves about george ( rod taylor ) , victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension - time . 

at the eve of the new 20th century , george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention - machine that would enable him to travel through time . 

they are skeptical , but that doesn't prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future . 

at first , he travels slowly , seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars . 

finally , after witnessing world war three , he travels far into the future , hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions . 

when he finally reaches year 802 , 701 ad , at first glance , new world looks like utopia - humanity consists of young , beautiful , but idle eloi , people who are fed , clothed and taken care of by unseen machines . 

but , weena ( yvette mimieux ) , eloi woman , tells george about another side of the coin - in the night , her people is preyed upon by morlocs , humanoid creatures from the underworld . 

the time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature - the fantastic concept was a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times . 

for h . g . wells it was frightening threat of class struggle ; for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan , who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war , it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust , underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie . 

even the modern audience , which would be tempted to discard the film as old-fashioned , could find some values in its universal messages , fit for each era . 

compared with the genre films of today , the time machine is even better , and could serve as a good example how to make intelligent , thought-provoking films . 

of course , since this is hollywood product after all , the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure , sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness . 

for example , it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future ; same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters , while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today . 

some of the final scenes , that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero , are also rather unconvincing . 

but , on the other hand , the film is very well directed , cleverly paced and the special effects , although definitely old-fashioned , are more than adequate for this kind of picture . 

the acting is good , with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles , while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as george's trusted friend filby . 

yvette mimieux , who plays weena , on the other hand , would be remembered more by her looks than by the complexity of her role . 

however , despite all those flaws , the time machine is a very good piece of cinema , something that connoisseurs of quality science-fiction films sorely miss these days .

"ingredients : neophyte lawyer , legal situations , corrupt insurance company , 

synopsis : rudy baylor ( matt damon ) is an ethical kid fresh out of law school who must juggle three legal situations at the same time . 

rudy's girlfriend is attacked by her violent husband ; rudy's elderly landlady wants to arrange her will so that her children are excluded , and ; the family of rudy's friend with leukemia is suing the corrupt insurance company that wouldn't pay for a bone marrow transplant . 

rudy is new to being a lawyer and is thoroughly outgunned , but luckily he is aided by a sleazy ambulance chaser ( danny devito ) who has failed the bar exam six times as well as by the kindly presiding judge ( danny glover ) . 

jon voight plays leo f . drummond , the intimidating and arrogant leader of the all-powerful insurance company's team of lawyers who will do anything to oppose justice . 

will rudy defeat leo ? 

will he enjoy being a lawyer ? 

opinion : the good news is that this movie has a happy ending , and it features a guy trying to do the right thing . 

director francis ford coppola does this film a little differently than the stereotypical law movie . 

in the typical lawyer movie there's one big case and the movie focuses on solving it , and somewhere along the line surprise witnesses and motives turn up before the good guy wins ( after lots of gripping courtroom drama ) . 

however , coppola's movie is deliberately more low key . 

'the rainmaker' plays out like a personality sketch of young rudy as he gets emotionally involved with and tries to save various little quirky side characters . 

in the background rudy's voice narrates his feelings and makes half-cynical jokes about the legal profession in general . 

two factors combine to make this movie less heavy than it can be . 

first , rudy's time is split juggling three cases , rather than concentrating on a single high-stakes case . 

also , rudy's use of voice narration in place of acting makes the film lose some of its dramatic edge . 

the end result is an entertaining low key law movie where the good guys win , and rudy narrates his way into coming of age .

"synopsis : retiring detective jerry black ( nicholson ) becomes involved in the case of a murdered girl , and promises her parents that he will find the killer . 

he purchases a gas station on a route he believes the killer takes , and there befriends lori ( wright penn ) and her young daughter . 

as jerry and lori fall in love , can he do what must be done to fulfill his pledge ? 

review : at first , "" the pledge "" appears to be just another standard , if well-executed , crime drama . 

it is anything but ; in its final hour , it turns the corner and becomes a riveting , terrifying study of its lead character , jerry black . 

penn pays attention to all the trappings of the serial killer genre , but they are just window dressing . 

his interest here , unequivocally , is jerry , a man so haunted by his pledge that it consumes the entirety of the his existence . 

at first , we see this only in small hints ; some of his habits change , for instance , and he suddenly takes up smoking in a big way . 

but then , when jerry buys the gas station and befriends lori , the true extent of his mania draws horrifyingly into focus . 

nicholson is fantastic , portraying black with rare subtlety and animus ; jerry's gradual descent into obsession is like a car wreck , a thing horrible to look at but impossible to turn away from . 

penn coaxes good supporting performances from much of the rest of his cast , too . 

only eckhart disappoints as jerry's replacement , stan ; he never seems entirely convincing , too much a tool of the plot . 

penn's direction is astounding , each frame looking as though it is parched -- of water , perhaps , or of sanity . 

it all builds up to a shattering , devastating climax which lingers uncomfortably in the mind long after the house lights have come up .

"young einstein is embarrassingly lame , but that didn't stop it from becoming a phenomenon in australia , where it became the third largest box office hit of all time . 

in the u . s . , warner brothers is hoping the movie will follow in the footsteps of paul hogan , inxs , and shrimp on the barby to become the latest rage from down under . 

personally , i'm hoping americans everywhere will rise to the occasion and make young einstein a box office bomb . 

young einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo serious , who not only wrote , produced , edited , and directed the film , but also starred and did his own stunts . 

his creation is about as stupid and contrived as you'd expect from someone named yahoo . 

the movie takes substantial historical liberties in recreating einstein's youth . 

whereas the scientist actually hailed from germany , the film finds him still living with his parents on tasmania , a remote australian island . 

in addition to deriving the formula for energy and the theory of relativity , albert invents surfing , bubbles in beer , and the electric guitar . 

yahoo plays einstein as a naive and unrefined country hick--a clown with an insatiable curiosity . 

although yahoo's performance is at first endearing , the one-dimensional characterization loses its novelty faster than you can say e=mc2 . 

yahoo has created a charming family for albert , and the scenes on tasmania are often clever . 

but after the first twenty minutes , the movie quickly plummets and degenerates into a poor excuse for a comedy . 

young einstein is hampered by its lethargic pace and inane plot . 

yahoo must be an mtv addict because his movie features an omnipresent soundtrack ; unfortunately , the music is altogether gratuitous and quickly becomes overbearing . 

almost every other scene includes a blaring rock song that leaves you wondering whether you are watching a movie or a music video . 

the instrumental score , on the other hand , is generally playful ; yahoo uses such classics as the "" 1812 overture "" and the theme from the good , the bad and the ugly to great comic effect . 

halfway through young einstein , i knew for sure the movie was a stinker . 

but it wasn't until the very end that i finally put my finger on why : the comedy takes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies ( such as young sherlock holmes ) but from cheesy prime-time sitcoms . 

in fact , young einstein might have been more at home on network television , where its sophomoric humor wouldn't raise any eyebrows . 
"
" "" america's sweethearts "" has an intriguing premise and a great cast , but it isn't nearly as edgy or funny as it should be . 

almost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co-script writer billy crystal , who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co-hosting "" comic relief "" charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg ( two other paragons of self-indulgence ) . 

crystal ignores a simple , but crucial , rule : for a screwball comedy to work , the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting , because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous . 

 "" america's sweethearts "" takes place at a press junket , where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters . 

it's a promising set-up , but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules , thus dissipating the tension of the situation . 

by the end of the film , all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on , but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed . 

john cusack and catherine zeta-jones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison , a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector ( hank azaria ) , a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp . 

of the last nine films eddie and gwen made together , six crossed the $100 million mark , but the prospects for their final effort , a space opus titled "" time over time , "" are far from rosy . 

while eddie has spent many months in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup , gwen's solo films have tanked . 

to make matter worse , the director of the movie ( christopher walken ) , a "" visionary "" who purchased the unabomber's cabin and had it moved to his backyard , is withholding the film from the studio , insisting that the first screening be held at the junket . 

desperate to win over the press , the studio elects to hire lee ( billy crystal ) , a recently fired publicist , to salvage the situation . 

lee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation . 

he enlists the help of kiki ( julia roberts ) , gwen's sister , personal assistant and whipping girl . 

what lee doesn't know is that kiki is in love with eddie , a fact that could temper her effectiveness . 

press junkets are a haven for control freaks . 

studios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel , with food and drink always at hand . 

generally , on the evening of their arrival , writers are bussed to see the featured film , then ferreted straight back to the hotel . 

the next day , writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews . 

every 30 minutes or so , a producer , director , writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions , with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things . 

the atmosphere is one of cordial oppression ? writers are free to ask what they want , but understand that if the studio dislikes a question , they may not be invited to future junkets . 

representatives from tv stations face even more restrictions . 

they get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew , with the studio filming the exchanges . 

the "" reporters "" are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars , but to play it safe , the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs . 

placing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired , but the screenplay undermines the conceit . 

the junket is moved from the handsome , but highly confining , four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas . 

for most of the film , the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds , completely safe from the eyes of the press . 

when they do deal with journalists , the "" it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters "" premise is de-clawed . 

gwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll , they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media and , at the screening of the movie , everyone connected with the film goes nuts , all without any repercussions . 

lee certainly isn't bothered by any of the infantile outbursts ; in fact , he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids . 

is the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors ? 

hell no ? they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie . 

all of which underscores how billy crystal and co-writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise : the comedy in "" america's sweethearts "" is based on barely-in-control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters , except that it doesn't matter because any publicity is good publicity . 

and thus the very set-up for the film implodes , leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter . 

so what about the cast ? 

julia roberts , at her best playing the underdog , is utterly charming here , although i could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit ( and not a very convincing one , by the way ) . 

catherine zeta-jones makes a believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic . 

by casting himself as the publicist , billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on "" comic relief "" - stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks . 

in supporting roles , hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and a spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed "" too broad . "" 

seth green is amusing as a toadie , stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair , though he has little to work with . 

come to think of it , "" little to work with "" is the operative phrase for this movie . 

as a hollywood satire , "" america's sweethearts "" is toothless . 

as a romance , it is at best a minor pleasure . 

such a good cast , such a waste of their efforts . 

had it not been taken long ago , a better title for the film would have been "" much ado about nothing . "" 
"
"billed as a "" feminist sex fantasy "" , this spirited , imaginative and thoroughly engaging film by the award-winning canadian director cynthia roberts , is destined for extreme reactions . 

camille paglia enthusiasts will no doubt champion this heart-felt tale of the title character bubbles galore ( nina hartley ) , a porn-actress-turned-porn-producer who faces an uphill battle in her quest for sexual and economic independence . 

however , those in the andrea dworkin camp , will no doubt loathe the film's decidedly pro-porn stance . 

political considerations aside , however , this is a delightful lesbian love story as the film takes us on a whirlwind tour of bubbles' romantic entanglements with a naive and virginal young porn starlet dory drawers ( shauny sexton ) . 

in the backdrop , however is bubbles' loyal assistant vivian klitorsky ( tracy wright ) who pines longingly for the affections of her bubbly boss . 

this femme-butch-femme triangle is what provides the film with considerable humanity * and * sensuality . 

in addition to the romantic aspects of the story , bubbles is being stalked and terrorized by her ex-boyfriend godfrey montana ( daniel macivor ) , a slimy porn mogul who wishes to make her life as miserable as he can possibly make it . 

when his plans to sabotage her latest film fall through , he snaps and psychotically decides to kill her . 

these proceedings are presided over by a most heavenly presence . 

god herself - yes , in the world of this film , god , is most definitely a "" her "" - and a chorus of undulating , scantily-clad angels , have their most watchful and lustful eyes on the events as they unfold , adding a lovely fantasy element to this frothy concoction . 

this bright , colourful and deliriously sexy film is chock-full of great performances . 

making her dramatic debut , after appearing in over 300 triple x adult films , porn star nina hartley takes command of her role with considerable assurance and a screen presence which puts many other contemporary 'straight' actresses to shame . 

hartley has overwhelming star power , and one wonders why other non-triple-x producers haven't used her bountiful talents . 

it is also interesting to note that hartley appears in the recent release of "" boogie nights "" , a film which takes a far more traditional doom-and-gloom approach to the porn industry . 

making a cameo appearance in the role of god , former porn actress annie sprinkle , a true artist in her own right - gives the entire film an earthy , sensual glow and certainly solidifies and , by her very appearance , downright justifies the themes of the movie . 

the other performances are equally solid . 

daniel macivor appropriately chews up the scenery as the villainous godfrey and tracy wright lends able support with her complex role . 

shauny sexton , an erotic dancer and pin-up model , makes an impressive screen debut . 

overall , bubbles galore is a film which wears its politics on its sleeve and very proudly indeed . 

at one point , the title character declares that "" instead of trying to save women from the sex trade , we should be working to ensure that the sex trade is a safe place for women to work "" . 

the direction by cynthia roberts is daring and subversive . 

roberts is not afraid to plunge the otherwise straight-ahead and simple narrative into extended and extremely avant-garde montage sequences . 

the love scenes between the women are especially beautiful . 

the musical score by nicholas stirling blends cool jazz and lounge stylings , while the skilful cinematography by harald bachmann terrifically captures a blend of garish 70's porn and psychedelia . 

amazingly , this film appears to have received a good deal of its funding from a variety of canadian government cultural agencies . 

this speaks volumes towards the importance of state funding for culture , as one cannot imagine such an entertaining , original and vital film being made in a traditional setting where conformity and formula rule the day . 

bubbles galore seems to be making the film festival rounds and does not , at present , appear to have any traditional distribution in place , so keep your eye on the alternative film listings for this one . 

it's funny , sexy and subversive . 

and it shouldn't be missed .

"how many of us would become strippers ? 

for those of us who wouldn't , is it a moral reason , or purely a lack of confidence ? 

that's probably not a fair question , and for a lot of us , it could very well be for neither of those reasons . 

as you watch the full monty , however , you may begin asking yourself these kinds of questions . 

would you be willing to grin and bare it to bring in some much needed dough ? 

in case you haven't guessed , the full monty is about stripping , but striptease it ain't . 

it's actually quite a charming comedy that uses its ideas with a great deal of tact and sophistication . 

it is the story of six out-of-work , out-of-shape blue collar brits whose recent job losses have left the boys penniless , but not without need . 

what to do ? 

it hits our main character gaz ( robert carlyle ) as he notices the large crowds of women who pour into a local male strip club on a regular basis . 

it seems that simple : take it off and bring in the cash . 

eventually , gaz is able to convince his friends to join him in starting their own exotic dance routine despite their initial reluctance . 

these include the overweight , confidence-lacking dave ( mark addy ) , the uptight , overly-officious gerald ( tom wilkinson ) , the once suicidal lomper ( steve huison ) , and two additional fellows who gain their place among the group by audition : horse ( paul barber ) , an older gentlemen chock full of graceless energy , and guy ( hugo speer ) , a young well-endowed looker who compares himself to cary grant . 

when the sextet is complete , we're given a hefty dose of physical comedy . 

we watch the bumbling middle-aged men choreograph pseudo-sexy dance numbers , all the while proving why none of them were strippers in the first place . 

as if there anti-appeal wasn't enough , they decide to boost interest in the group by promising "" the full monty "" on opening night , which for us americans , means baring it all . 

 . 

 . 

and i mean * all * . 

the movie actually ends on opening night ; a hilarious applause worthy ending i might add . 

it's sure to leave nothing short of a big smile on your face as you leave the theater . 

with the subject matter , you might not expect the fully monty to be such a feel-good , almost inspiring film , but it surprisingly turns out that way . 

the amount of light , touching drama also comes as a nice surprise , never feeling off-balance from the otherwise highly upbeat moments of the film . 

there's a lot more to this movie than you might think in other words , and the ensemble cast couldn't be better . 

each character is completely individual , interesting , funny , and most importantly , real . 

the full monty is never offensive , a very impressive attribute since its subject matter alone could've easily fallen prey to tastelessness . 

it's one of those movies that is best described as a solid piece of entertainment , perfect for a great night on the town , or as a saturday night movie rental . 

either way you see it , it shouldn't let you down in the slightest . 

and , pun heavily intended , when it's all said and done , you'll be smiling from cheek to cheek .

"defending your life is an imaginative vision of the afterlife from the twisted mind of writer-director albert brooks , who also stars in the comedy . 

after dying in a car crash , on his birthday of all days , brooks wakes up in judgement city , a satirical rendition of purgatory where higher beings evaluate the lives of newly deceased earthlings . 

brooks has five days to convince two judges that he's worthy of passing on to higher plains of existence . 

enter rip torn as the slick lawyer who defends brooks in court against prosecutor lee grant . 

during his "" trial , "" brooks must view episodes of his life on a movie screen , and these scenes are both hysterically funny and painfully poignant . 

it's impossible to resist chuckling ( and cringing ) at brooks as he and torn try to explain away his cowardly behavior on earth . 

torn , in particular , is in vintage comic form , and he walks away with the picture . 

the movie also features meryl streep , appealing as the love-interest , and shirley maclaine , who pops up in a hilarious cameo . 

while the film is uneven , many of its gags are price less . 

take , for example , the food in judgement city : it's always the most delicious you've ever tasted . . . 

and it's also calorie-free--so chow down !

"disney cements their place in the forefront of feature animation with the release of their latest animated adventure , mulan . 

while it adheres a bit too close to the disney formula to be perfect , it is nonetheless an entertaining film for both kids and adults . 

fa mulan ( ming-na wen , singing : lea salonga ) wants nothing more than to be a dutiful daughter and honor her family . . . it's 

just that she doesn't quite fit in with the chafing customs of her time . 

while most girls her age are trying to quietly and demurely seek the approval of the local matchmaker ( miriam margoyles ) , mulan would prefer speaking her mind . 

but there is trouble on the horizon . 

the evil huns , led by shan-yu ( miguel ferrer ) , are invading china . 

the emperor ( pat morita ) has decreed that each family must donate one man to serve in the army . 

the only male in mulan's family is her father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) , who , old and with a bad leg , honorably accepts his fate . 

mulan , on the other hand , decides to save her father's life . . . by 

secretly masquerading as a man and taking his place on the battlefield . 

mulan , under the assumed name of ping , appears at camp where she , along with the other bumbling recruits , yao ( harvey fierstein ) , chien-po ( jerry tondo ) and ling ( gedde watanabe ) , are trained in the art of war by captain shang ( b . d . 

wong , singing : donny osmond ) . 

but she's not alone in her tasks . . . in 

typical disney fashion , she has three animal companions : her horse khan , a lucky cricket crickey , and a pint-sized "" guardian "" dragon called mushu ( eddie murphy ) . 

much like the gargoyles in the hunchback of notre dame , the humor in mulan is lukewarm and doesn't flow well with the rest of the more serious story . 

sure , some occasional comic relief is welcome , particularly in a film geared for the younger set , but mulan overdoes it . 

the overdose of humor turns what could have been a powerfully great film into a good , but schizophrenic experience . 

but , that commentary aside , this is a very well made film ( which makes the formulaic additions all the more regrettable ) . 

the animation is on par with some of disney's best . 

the story itself is interesting , and the action scenes are awe-inspiring . 

the musical score to the film is enjoyable , though , as has been the case with disney's recent work , the songs are mostly forgettable . 

at least , we're only subjected to four of them this time around . 

mulan boasts the highest death toll of any disney cartoon to date . 

most of the killing is off-screen and it's all highly depersonalized ( there's nothing to compare with the death of mufasa or bambi's mom ) . 

there's nothing graphic , and the film resides snugly inside a g rating . 

children will probably have more questions about the restrictive ancient customs than of the slaughter of armies . 

it's ironic that a film concerned with bucking tradition is hampered because of its strict adherence to disney tradition . 

if the filmmakers had the guts to lessen the humor , ax the compulsory songs , and remove the obligatory ( and somewhat unrealistic ) romance , they could have had a classic on their hands . 

instead , they merely deliver a very good time at the movies .

"warren beatty's "" bulworth "" is a caustic political comedy that doesn't attack any particular political group , but rather the ingrained insincerity that has infected the american political system . 

some might think this film is vulgar , and in many ways it is . 

however , as loud and raucous as it is , "" bulworth "" speaks the truth , which is almost always ugly to hear . 

beatty , who directed the film and co-wrote the script with jeremy pikser ( "" the lemon sisters "" ) , stars as incumbent u . s . senator jay billington bulworth , who has one of the best politician names in cinema history . 

bulworth is a democrat , and in beatty's view , he is symbolic of everything that has gone wrong with the current democratic party . 

once an ideological liberal ( like beatty still is ) , bulworth has long since succumbed to the materialistic pressures of washington . 

instead of waging the battles for the impoverished and the downtrodden , which was once the calling card of democrats , bulworth has become another sell-out money hound - if he's not accepting illegal bribes from the insurance lobby or taking campaign contributions from the chinese , he's making wind-bag speeches that start with the amusingly clintonesqe statement , "" america is standing on the doorstep of a new millennium . . . . 

blah , blah , blah . "" 

when the film opens , it is a few days before the 1996 primary elections , and bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he has become . 

in a fit of desperation , he takes out a $10 million life insurance policy from a dirty insurance rep played by paul sorvino ( part of a shady lobby deal to kill a threatening bill in committee ) , and then hires a hit man to kill him , although he doesn't know who the assassin will be , or when the hit will take place . 

knowing that he will soon be dead , bulworth unleashes his own brand of political rhetoric on the world , which is made up of politically incorrect truths about the state of american politics and the society in general . 

at a compton church , he tells the group of african-americans that they will have no power in the u . s . unless they "" put down that malt liquor and chicken wings , and get behind somebody other than a running back who stabs his wife . "" 

later , in a particularly hilarious sequence , bulworth mixes with the hollywood elite , then insults the quality of their movies and informs them that the only reason he's there is because "" my guys always put the big jews on my schedule . "" 

all throughout this physically and politically suicidal escapade , bulworth's chief of staff , dennis murphy ( oliver platt ) , follows behind in a state of constant shock and bewilderment . 

platt has some of the movie's funniest scenes , as he makes murphy into a politically savvy but nonetheless clueless assistant who is forced to watch his own career teeter at the brink of being flushed down the toilet . 

his constant half-truth-telling and spin-doctoring to cover bulworth's stampede is equaled in its perversion only by a self-righteous reporter ( nora dunn ) who acts like murphy's refusal to explain bulworth's actions ( something he really cannot do ) is somehow an act of treason . 

when bulworth decides he wants to live after all , and therefore must constantly evade a grim-looking assassin to be who's trailing him at every turn , he hides out in the ghetto , complete with a stereotypical gangsta wardrobe which he wears to one of his television interviews . 

at this point , beatty abandons much of the political aspect and dives into a cartoonish exploration of the black inner-city experience . 

bulworth becomes friendly with a young black woman named nina ( halle berry ) , who he meets at the harlem church rally . 

she has a tough-talking brother who is deep in debt to a local gangster named l . d . 

 ( don cheadle of "" boogie nights "" ) , who also becomes involved in bulworth's campaign . 

some of the scenes in the ghetto ring true , but much of it feels like a lighter version of scenes depicted in more intense inner-city films like "" boyz'n'hood "" ( 1991 ) and "" menace ii society "" ( 1993 ) . 

 "" bulworth's "" chief liability is beatty's insistence on having his character adopt a clumsy style of rap as his new communication device . 

instead of speaking at political rallies , he breaks into a kind of rhythmless rap style that is a reminder of why almost all hip-hop stars are black . 

it's hard to tell whether beatty is being humorous by being so bad , or whether he's actually that incompetent . 

at any rate , the rap sounds more run d . m . c . 

than snoop doggy dogg , which makes the film seem dated instead of contemporary . 

beatty would have been better off simply adopting some of the inner-city lingo and working that into his speeches , instead of trying to sound like l . l . cool j . 

other than that , "" bulworth "" hits all its targets with wry , hilarious accuracy . 

the film is like a letter bomb to the democratic party , and even if you don't agree with beatty's liberal message about the unrequited duties of the federal government , it is hard to deny the impact the film has in exploring the monetary and moral debauchery that infests modern politics . 

unlike "" primary colors "" which opened earlier this year , "" bulworth "" doesn't try to tip-toe around the truly painful issues that hit close to home - instead , it takes them dead-on .

"with three pre- to mid-teen children and an aging father-in-law to care for--cooking and cleaning and laundry , drop-offs at little league practice and pick-ups from ballet practice--margaret hall's life is rife with complications . 

and with her naval officer husband stationed somewhere in the north atlantic , virtually impossible to reach by telephone , margaret leads the crazed life of a single parent . 

but margaret's hectic world is about to get a lot more complicated . 

her teenage son beau , a talented trumpet player with strong prospects of being accepted into wesleyan university's music program , has fallen in with the wrong crowd . 

his mother drives from their idyllic , lakeside community of tahoe city , california to the sprawling urban metropolis of reno , nevada , with its imposing concrete superstructures and seedy neon-lit nightclubs , to confront the 30-something man who has befriended beau . 

 "" stay away from my son "" margaret warns darby reese . 

her words , however , appear to fall on deaf ears as reese turns up drunk at the family homestead later that evening , urging beau to join him in the boathouse . 

there are words and advances and some pushing and shoving and beau runs back into the house , passed his startled mother , as the crack of a wooden railing giving way breaks the cold blue silence and an intoxicated reese tumbles out of sight . 

the next day , on her morning walk , margaret discovers reese's lifeless body lying crumpled on the shoreline , a boat anchor impaled in his chest . 

with her maternal instincts working overtime , margaret quickly ferries the body out into the lake , weighs it down , and dumps it overboard . 

but margaret's life is about to get a lot more complicated . 

soon after the body is discovered , snagged on a local fisherman's line , margaret is paid a visit by an attractive-seeming blackmailer in a red nova . 

alek spera threatens to hand over compromising videotape of beau to the police unless margaret comes up with $50 , 000 by 4 o'clock the next day . 

but margaret's life is about to get a lot more complicated , for alek turns out to be something she never expected . 

based on elisabeth sanxay holding's novel "" the blank wall , "" "" the deep end "" is a well-crafted thriller written and directed by scott mcgehee and david siegel ( "" suture "" ) . 

it makes the most of a talented but not particularly well-known cast--goran visnjic plays alek with a suave likeability , jonathan tucker shines as the conflicted beau , peter donat is amusing as grandfather hall , and josh lucas has an equally small but effective role as the hapless darby reese . 

the film is also lovingly photographed by giles nuttgens and features an evocative score , courtesy peter nashel . 

but it owes everything to british actress tilda swinton . 

swinton , whose pale-faced ethereal beauty has graced many of derek jarman's films ( "" caravaggio , "" "" edward ii , "" "" the last of england "" ) , plays margaret hall in "" the deep end "" and , like charlotte rampling in this year's "" under the sand , "" turns in a commanding and accomplished performance . 

margaret is a devoted mother who is willing to risk everything to protect the ones she loves , and swinton captures every frustration , every fear , every subtle examination and every fervent realization and every nervous oscillation of her being . 

the role calls for an extremely wide range of emotions none the least of which is simply playing a mother beset with a multitude of domestic responsibilities . 

many can relate to that , of course ; it's the murder cover-up and the blackmail and the fear of losing one's son that swinton so gracefully , so graciously , makes resonate with the truest of colors . 

the end is deep all right , and there isn't a single shallow moment in tilda swinton's canon .

" "" flubber "" is the second best example of how to take all the life out of a film remake an adaptation , and hysterically enough both were distributed by disney . 

it's the kind of film that may be slightly entertaining to tiny kids , but anyone else will feel left out as it's boring , slow , and incredibly lifeless . 

what could be a film with cinematic magic is instead dead in the water , and it's a shame because it could have been a great film . 

hypothetically , i mean . 

 "" flubber , "" as you probably know , is a remake of the disney classic i never saw , "" the absent minded professor , "" where a , well , absent minded professor played by fred mcmurray created an erratic substance known as "" flubber , "" you know , flying rubber ? 

the new one keeps the basic plot , but appears to have added a lot else , like more absent-mindedness on the part of the proffessor , some more villains , and several "" show-stopping "" moments , like a big rumba with the flubber , and some more elaborate setups , none which really make it any better , but instead make it worse . 

the basic plot revolves around a college professor , philip brainerd ( robin williams ) , who creates lots and lots of inventions , but is sadly absent minded . 

in fact , he's forgotten his wedding to the college's president , sara jean reynolds ( indie actress marcia gay harden ) , two times before he forgets it again at the beginning . 

doesn't this warrant some kind of mental treatment ? 

anyway , on his wedding day ( the third one ) , he invents the flubber , which not only bounces off of everything like a super ball on speed , but can also change shape like the aliens in water form in "" the abyss . "" 

philip believes that this invention , once fully realized , will save his college , which is in threat of being shut down by a millionaire tycoon/villain , chester hoenicker ( raymond j . barry ) , which is ironically enough the same college his brat son ( will wheaton - thought he was dead ) goes to . 

through a plot twist , hoenicker's goons , named smith and wesson ( ha ha - what a great sense of humor this film has ) who are played by clancy brown and ted levine ( both who needed the pay check ) , discover it the hard way , and try to steal for hoenicker , who wants it just 'cause he's evil enough . 

a sub-plot involves philip's attempts to win back sara , who's angry at him ( and with good reason ) , but who is being seduced by who is basically philip's belloq , wilson croft ( christopher mcdonald , playing the hysterically suave-yet-unsuave asswhole once again ) . 

and in another subplot , philip's day-timer robot , weebo ( voiced by the one-and-only jodi benson ) , falls in love with him . 

yuckity-yuck . 

what's most pathetic about this film is how dull it is . 

you don't need to be a cynical college student to be able to see right through this film , which is another in a long line of cheap attempts at making a quick buck by disney , who have essentially become the puff daddy of the film industry , half-assedly re-mixing classics ( or non-classics ) for distribution to the general public , who sadly eats it all up . 

earlier in '97 , they released "" jungle 2 jungle , "" an adaptation of a really awful french film , "" un indien dans la ville , "" which , yeah , improved over the original , but not by much . 

disney's in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now , only creatively . 

in the rush to ship out a film for distribution , disney has forgotten to give this film a little thing called "" magic . "" 

such scenes as dancing flubber , a flying car , a basketball team that pretty much sucks flying all around thanks to some carefully placed flubber , and an elaborate ending all fail to amaze , delight , or even cause people to laugh . 

i sat there the entire film stone faced , chuckling perhaps twice , and shaking my head at all the bad jokes . 

who could really laugh at a scene where philip enters the wrong classroom and starts teaching chemistry ? 

didn't think so . 

it doesn't help that our protagonist is essentially unfunny or even really respectable . 

philip is not a lovable absent minded professory , just a really dumb man being played by robin williams . 

williams is a brilliant comic actor . . . okay , a brilliant actor in general , but here he's given very little to do but occasionally get hyper over something , and other times act sad . 

those times , he's not bad . 

but what are we supposed to think of a man who's forgotten his wedding thrice ? 

maybe it was funny and/or respectable in the 60s . . . 

i like disney , and i usually enjoy their films , not only animated but live action , and their recent films ( save for "" hercules , "" which was good , but not great ) have been worse than lackluster , they've been pathetic . 

 "" jungle 2 jungle "" is probably the worst film i saw last year . 

 "" flubber "" 's probably second . 

what do they need to do ? 

perhaps create something new . 

get writers who can write something that's universally entertaining . 

films like "" the parent trap "" and "" mary poppins "" are films that are live action ( or in the latter case a mix of both ) , but even i can still watch them because they're not only written to be magical to children , but to be fun to adults . 

what's more torturous that taking a child to a film that insults you and annoys you at every turn ? 

and my god , couldn't they have done something else with edie mcclurg ?

"filmmakers will use all manner of tricks to flesh out and brighten up a dull , dreary , and overused idea . 

doug liman ( swingers ) , director of the ultra-hip and severely dark comedy go , is an example of just such a filmmaker . 

in his latest , he gives the viewers a raucous , neon-lit backdrop as cinematographer and points the audience down a drug-infested path of misadventure as director . 

but he fails to come up with any parallel structure in his multi-tiered movie and he fails to connect with the audience on any level , bringing the worth of his efforts to nil and the value of go to about the same . 

his movie is produced anthology-style -- telling the same story from multiple ( three ) points of view , much as an author might write a serial novel . 

consistent with this ethic , liman and screenwriter john august provide a bit of an overlap at the beginning of each narrative and insert brief connections to other narratives . 

the thread that laces the three stories together is a drug deal and the events thereafter . 

in story a we have checkout clerk ronna ( sarah polley ) looking to score some rent money and turning to drug trafficking to do it ; in story b we have regular drug dealer simon ( desmond askew ) gone to las vegas giving ronna her opportunity ; and in story c we have gay soap actors zack ( jay mohr ) and adam ( scott wolf ) working undercover for the police to bust said drug deal . 

neither of the three stories have much substance , and the movie has the feel of a campfire story ( albeit a rather strange one ) that could be told in five to ten minutes . 

 ( in fact , the movie was originally a short film entitled x expanded to feature length . ) 

the early april release date is too mistimed to capitalize on the movie's christmas setting , and the los angeles/las vegas nightlife is something too far from the mainstream for most theater-goers to attach themselves to . 

the characters are shallow to the point of prerequisite , and performances from little-known players like polley , askew , and taye diggs don't help or hurt the roles . 

in fact , even bigger names like mohr , wolf , and katie holmes don't have enough time to make substantial success . 

although that's almost expected for lack of continuous screen time , the success in the picture should come from a thread that binds the stories . 

go doesn't have this , and it suffers because of it . 

as far as teen movies are concerned , go represents the absolute bottom , for its constant stream of indecipherable light and sound mean nothing without some sort of common theme . 

 ( the following do not count as common themes : drug deals , people attempting to have romantic interludes with drug dealers , people resorting to drug deals for alterior motives , or people not involved in drug deals stumbling into them . ) 

at times , the humor in go is sickly funny , and on a low night , almost watchable ; but for the majority of its running time and for most viewers , this movie will best be left to teens at blockbuster on a saturday night .

" "" lake placid "" marks yet another entry in the series of "" predator pics "" that were a screen staple in the late 1970s ( post- "" jaws "" ) and were revived recently by the godawful "" anaconda . "" 

 "" placid "" claims to be a "" horror/comedy "" -it's directed by the same guy who did "" house "" -but its attempts at humor are actually less funny than deadpan seriousness of "" anaconda . "" 

paleontologist kelly scott ( bridget fonda ) is sent up to maine to examine a tooth removed from a body that had been bitten in half on the lake . 

discovering that the tooth belongs to a crocodile ( which shouldn't even be in this hemisphere ) , kelly goes croc-hunting with game warden jack wells ( bill pullman ) and sheriff hank keough ( brendan gleeson ) . 

they're joined by an unwelcome guest , hector cyr ( oliver platt ) , a scholar who worships crocs and searches all over the world for them . 

along the way , the merry band meets mrs . delores bickerman ( betty white ) , a weird old lady who lives out on the lake . 

you know what to expect from this movie : lots of shots where the camera is the eyes of the predator ( croc cam ) swimming toward someone's dangling legs while "" jaws "" -like music plays , one character ( hector ) who's obsessed with the croc and stupidly endangers the rest , another character who insists that the predator can't possibly exist . 

unlike its slippery cousin "" anaconda , "" "" lake placid "" wants to present its formulaic plot tongue-in-cheek , which is self-defeating . 

the result is neither scary nor funny ; it's just tedious . 

while director steve miner has several horror films on his resume ( including two installments of "" friday the 13th "" and "" halloween h20 "" ) , screenwriter david kelley ( best known as the creator of tv series like "" ally mcbeal "" and "" chicago hope "" ) doesn't seem to have the stomach for a chomp 'em up flick . 

the body count is surprisingly low and doesn't include any of the major characters , and most annoyingly kelly and hector insist that they capture the crocodile alive rather than killing it . 

 ( "" lake placid "" manages to have it both ways-i'll let you discover how for yourself ) . 

the croc itself is mostly computer-generated , of course . 

like the snake in "" anaconda , "" the thirty-foot monster crocodile doesn't seem real ; it moves too quickly and in ways that seem unnatural . 

 "" lake placid "" also offers little explanation for why a giant crocodile is in maine . 

there is a lot of semi-mystical mumbo jumbo about how "" we really don't know much about crocodiles . "" 

they would have been better off going with something like the urban myth about alligators in the sewers . 

a movie like this doesn't have to offer much of an explanation ( radioactive mutant ? 

creature from outer space ? ) , but it does have to give the audience something to hang their disbelief on . 

pullman and fonda seem to be plodding through the movie on auto-pilot . 

most of the time , they're probably thinking about killing their agents or wondering if making this movie marks the end of their careers . 

platt and white , on the other hand , seem to be giving their best efforts , and they manage to squeeze a few chuckles out of this sorry script . 
"
"do the folks at disney have no common decency ? 

they have resurrected yet another cartoon and turned it into a live action hodgepodge of expensive special effects , embarrassing writing and kid-friendly slapstick . 

wasn't mr . magoo enough , people ? 

obviously not . 

inspector gadget is not what i would call ideal family entertainment . 

younger viewers will likely be taken in by the abounding goofiness , but their adult companions may feel a wave of nausea sweeping over them as they attempt to endure this appalling 80-minute exercise in glaring stupidity . 

the movie is poorly edited , grossly manipulative , and the finished product resembles somewhat of a failed jigsaw puzzle . 

all the elements are there , but the manner in which director david kellogg pieces them together is laughable and trite . 

as a huge fan of the 80's animated tv show , the first thing i must express is my anger toward the treatment of the main villain . 

in the cartoon , dr . claw was a frightening , raspy-voiced presence who remained a total mystery to the viewer . 

we never saw his face ; he simply sat back in his arm-chair , watching surveillance cameras and gently stroking his loyal cat . 

as a child , i always imagined what dr . claw would appear as - and this curiosity kept me watching for many years . 

with the release of the live-action movie , the face of this once intriguing villain has been unrightfully exposed - it's . . . 

rupert everett ? ! 

only now , dr . claw is simply known as claw ( `one word , ' he explains , `like madonna' ) . 

he sports a shiny clamp instead of the steel glove , and seems far less interesting than the animated version . 

it helps that the dashing everett is enthusiastic , but he overplays the role entirely too far . 

when all is said and done , this wasn't a very wise move on the part of the screenwriters - the infamous dr . claw has been turned into a wisecracking game show host who makes cheap attempts at being suave and cool . 

he does still have his cat , though . 

in the title role , matthew broderick looks lost . 

the actor , while usually downright charming , doesn't know exactly where to take his character - a fault that again can be blamed on the hapless writers . 

broderick first plays a friendly , naive security guard named john brown , who dreams of becoming a cop and upholding the law for the good of the people . 

he has a mad crush on pretty scientist brenda ( joely fisher ) , who has stumbled upon a new wave of technology involving the interaction of human tissue and electronics . 

but one fateful night , her lab is destroyed and her experiment is stolen by a fiendish millionaire ( everett ) who wants to take over the world . 

john courageously pursues the limousine from the scene of the crime , but loses the chase when his vehicle bursts into flames . 

in a full body cast , he is chosen to be the first human prototype for brenda's work ; a revolutionary crime fighting tool with numerous fancy gadgets to dispatch bad guys . 

and so is born inspector gadget . 

as bad as this movie is , it does have a certain charm in isolated scenes . 

broderick actually fares better playing robo gadget , an evil and destructive clone that claw has set loose on the city . 

and there are about two or three amusing punch lines , the funniest being when robo gadget impersonates a rampaging monster with shadow puppets on a brick wall , and a japanese man flees the scene while screaming , `this is why i left tokyo ! ' 

alas , the hit ratio of the ongoing gags is about 20 to 1 in favor of not even cracking a slight giggle . 

there are so many tired plot additions . 

gadget's talking car ( voiced by d . l . 

hughley ) is the same type of character as zoot the suit from my favorite martian . 

both are wisecracking , non-human additions designed to coax laughter from smaller children . 

well , it just doesn't work ( in fact , zoot functioned marvelously in comparison to this ) . 

and don't even get me started about the villains . 

i didn't mind everett's performance , but his bumbling assistants will make every adult cringe with disgust . 

the characters from the cartoon have been reduced to thankless supporting roles . 

penny ( michelle trachtenberg ) and brain the dog now have little to do with the action , and chief quimby ( dabney coleman ) has lost considerable appeal in the transition of animation to live action . 

the special effects are everywhere , but not so annoying they will cause your eyes to peel over . 

the problem here lies solely in the script . 

perhaps the next time disney attempts a remake like this , they will invest more in the screenplay than the fancy-schmancy visuals . 

here is one critic crossing his fingers , anyway .

"apollo 13 is simply one of the most dramatic film this summer ( apart from swashbuckling braveheart ) . 

director ( and former actor ) ron howard ( splash , backdraft , far & away ) , most noted for his dramatic film making , displays again his brilliance in creating drama and suspense in apollo 13 . 

being the second largest box office hit in the us this summer ( with more than us$150 million in the states alone ) , this film is his most successful effort yet . 

perhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks ( gump himself ) , kevin bacon ( footloose , tremors , a few good men etc . ) , gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , bill paxton ( aliens , true lies , boxing helena ) and ed harris ( the abyss , just cause ) . . 

all of whom gave good performances in their respective roles . 

apollo 13 was the second worst accident ever to occur in the history of us spaceflight ( the worst being the challenger accident ) . 

jim lovell ( hanks ) , the mission commander , together with his crew , fred haise ( paxton ) and last minute replacement tom swigert ( bacon ) are put to the ultimate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission , more than three quarters way to the moon . 

suspense and drama ensue as the three men are left in space with their spaceship out of control and the problem of surviving the journey home . . . 

if they ever reach it . 

ed harris and gary sinise who play , respectively , the man in charge of the entire mission control and the astronaut who was supposed to fly but was diagnosed with measles , both delve into their roles superbly . 

audiences are shown the chaotic and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew , as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how to save the astronauts from hurtling into space . 

also , there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which took the entire us nation into 5 days of drama in 1970 . 

the special effects by digital domain are up to standard and the music suits the suspense and drama very well , thanks to film-music maestro james horner . 

watch out for the launching sequence , it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes of the film . 

a bad point though : apollo 13 features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script . 

those who consider themselves `scientifically illiterate' might have a slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show . 

this is however , just a minor point , just forget all those technical bullshit and immerse yourselves into the drama and suspense throughout the film . 

you should enjoy it . 
"
"ok , i admit it--i find camp amusement with the spice girls . 

yes , the same spice girls of the gimmicky individual "" identities , "" they of the annoyingly infectious bubblegum pop hooks and cheesy unifying mantra of "" girl power . "" 

but not even their guilty pleasure appeal isn't enough to carry their big screen debut , a junky mess which would be more aptly named shite world than spice world . 

the film begins amusingly enough , with a cheeky 007-esque title sequence in which the british quintet-- "" scary "" ( melanie brown ) , "" baby "" ( emma bunton ) , "" sporty "" ( melanie chisolm ) , "" ginger "" ( geri halliwell ) , and "" posh "" ( victoria adams ) --are introduced one by one ( to , much to my surprise , excited and only slightly mocking cheers from the press audience ) as they croon the silky ballad "" too much "" ( a tune that would sound right at home in an actual james bond film ) . 

a few minutes and an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour of the numerous plotlines that run through the film : ( 1 ) the spicy ones go on a european publicity tour leading up to their first live concert at london's royal albert hall ; ( 2 ) a film producer ( george wendt ) and a screenwriter ( mark mckinney ) pitch various film ideas to the girls' manager , clifford ( richard e . grant ) ; ( 3 ) a documentary film crew follows the girls ; ( 4 ) a pregnant "" mate "" ( naoki mori ) of the group rapidly approaches her due date ; and ( 5 ) a tabloid publisher ( barry humphries ) attempts to destroy the group with the help of a sneaky shutterbug ( richard o'brien ) . 

capped off by a live rendition of the girls' bouncy hit "" say you'll be there , "" a wealth of laughs and merriment is sure to follow , right ? 

wrong . it's all downhill from there as spice world collapses into a series of misfired comedy sketches . 

i must give the girls credit for their refreshing willingness to make fun of themselves , but writer kim fuller and director bob spiers can barely come up with a funny joke between them , much less a organized framework for all the "" wacky "" goings-on . 

spice world jumps from vignette to vignette , subplot to subplot with no direction and little sense , at one minute having the girls meet with aliens ( no joke ) and at another having them stage a daring rescue of two young fans who fall into the water during a boat ride . 

while a decent joke slips through the cracks here and there--during a "" dance bootcamp "" scene , the girls sing the lyric "" we know how we got this far/strength and courage and a wonderbra "" --much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level . 

some gags are just plain pointless , such as roger moore's recurring role as the mysterious chief , who dispenses cryptic , metaphor-heavy advice to clifford . 

the only reason why i can think anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond . 

ha ha . 

as weak as the script is , i think there's one insurmountable problem with even attempting to make a spice girls movie , and that is the girls themselves . 

the point is not that they can't act ( and , for the record , they really _can't_ ) but that their individual personas , which works as a gimmick over the span of a four-minute music video , are too thin to survive outside of the truncated , video bite mtv world . 

posh ( who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions ) comes off best by default because her persona ( rich bitch ) most easily translates into character in a film . 

baby's persona ( young innocent ) , to a lesser extent , also works , but the remaining girls' identities are a little harder to flesh out . 

there really isn't much to do with sporty besides having her exercise every so often ( which is _exactly_ what fuller and spiers do ) , and , after all , what exactly entails being "" ginger "" or "" scary "" ? 

apparently , just their wardrobes . 

spice world manages to pick up some steam in the late going following a flashback performance of the spices' signature hit , "" wannabe . "" 

the song is as grating as ever , but the energy of the number gives the proceedings a much-needed shot in the arm , setting the stage for a wave of self-referential humor stemmed from the screenwriters' film ideas ( the film almost mirrors robert altman's the player in the way the film snails into itself ) . 

this section of the film , involving all manner of derring-do involving a speeding bus , is perhaps its most effective , but it also points up how all the other storylines ( the publisher , the documentary crew ) lack a satisfactory payoff . 

spice world is harmless entertainment suitable for the entire family , and it will please the spice faithful . 

but this sloppy enterprise surely won't win them any new fans , which is what the group sorely needs to bolster its rapidly waning girl power in the states . 

once the hype disappears , spice world will likely serve as the the spices' final hurrah in america .

"brian depalma needs a hit * really * badly . 

since scoring big with the untouchables in 1987 , depalma has seen casualties of war , raising cain and particularly the disastrous bonfire of the vanities go down in flames . 

consequently , it would be easy enough to consider carlito's way a shrewd commercial choice for depalma , reteaming with al pacino ( scarface ) and returning to the gangland ground which has yielded his two greatest box office successes . 

it doesn't hurt any that he has latched on to a solid story and brought out dynamite performances from pacino and sean penn . 

carlito's way , while hampered by depalma's characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism , is a truly tense and engrossing drama . 

carlito brigante ( pacino ) is a life-long criminal who finds himself unexpectedly given a second chance . 

in 1975 , carlito is released from prison after serving only five years of a thirty year sentence when his conviction is overturned on a technicality . 

he declares himself reformed , tired of life on the streets and determined to fulfill his simple dream of buying into a rental car business in the bahamas . 

among those who find this conversion hard to believe are david kleinfeld ( penn ) , carlito's crooked attorney and childhood friend , and bodyguard pachanga ( luis guzman ) . 

carlito rediscovers old flame gail ( penelope ann miller ) , and seems ready to retire in peace . 

old ways die hard , though , and old associates pull carlito step by step back into a life he can't seem to shake . 

carlito's way will probably make the strongest impression with the two outstanding set pieces which bracket the film . 

in the first , carlito accompanies his young cousin on a drug buy which will have anyone with a pulse on the edge of their seat ; the film closes with an equally thrilling chase through the new york subway and grand central station . 

both highlight depalma's gift for choreographed mayhem , and these are not the only occasions when the stage blood flows freely . 

yet for all the viscera , i found the character study even more compelling . 

carlito brigante has a lot of michael corleone in him , an aging gangster trying unsuccessfully to go legit . 

but where the culmination of the godfather saga played like opera , there's more of an immediacy to carlito's way , an ever-present sense of doom launched by the title sequence which sets the flashback story in motion . 

you sense that there's no way , after so many years , that carlito can stay out of trouble . 

indeed , he observes that his attempt at the straight life is more a function of time than a change of heart : "" you don't get reformed ; you just run out of wind . "" 

pacino captures carlito's dilemma with surprising subtlety and the cautious observation borne of years of experience watching every corner for an enemy . 

sean penn is even better , turning in his best performance to date as kleinfeld . 

a jew in the world of puerto rican and italian wiseguys , kleinfeld is an outsider with a huge chip on his shoulder . 

he could have been simply pathetic , a heavy drinker and cocaine addict playing tough with guys way out of his league , but penn invests kleinfeld with tremendous nervous energy and an overwhelming survival instinct . 

he shows a man moving steadily towards the brink , making the moment he goes over quite jolting . 

as compelling as the narrative is , viewers may experience a profound sense of deja vu . 

depalma continues to steal shamelessly from other directors , this time adding scorsese to his repertoire with a point of view tracking shot and a copacabana scene with more than passing resemblances to goodfellas . 

he even recycles some of his own previous plagiarisms , like a 360 degree swing around a kiss ( vertigo via body double ) and the climactic shootout which will strike many as far too reminiscent of the train station sequence from the untouchables . 

from a story standpoint , there's an obligatory love story with a cliche'd long-suffering girlfriend character . 

penelope ann miller is a good but limited actor who doesn't do anything new with the role , and eventually she becomes just a distraction , never integrated fully enough into the story . 

still , it's easier to be forgiving of superficial flaws when the backbone is so solid . 

the two principle characters held an iron grip on my attention , one all the cinematic thievery in the world couldn't break . 

carlito's way plays like a tragic novel : deliberate , confident and powerful . 

those willing to grant depalma his tendencies towards the extreme should find themselves well- rewarded .

"i'm giving this stinker . 

normally , the worst that i would ever rate a movie would be . 

but the total waste of time that is blazing saddles is , compounded by the fact that this movie is incredibly offensive , helped me come to the big goose egg . 

i'm not sure what the hell mel brooks was thinking when he made this thing , or if he was even thinking at all . 

maybe in mel's little mind a horse being knocked unconscious because of a punch to the face is funny . 

in mine , it's not . 

or maybe mel graduated from the spike lee school of filmmaking . 

because only the self-righteous lee uses the n-word more often in his films than brooks did in this one . 

at least lee has the smarts to realize that nobody is going to find that term amusing . 

brooks bandies it about like he figures the audience will be rolling in the aisles every time they hear it . 

wrong mel ! 

i would call you a boob mel , but that insults breasts everywhere . 

this idiotic attempt at a comedy centers on the evil lieutenant governor's ( harvey korman ) attempts to clear out a town so he can buy up the land cheap and sell it to the railroad . 

he sends his goons to run the townsfolk out . 

but the town appeals to the governor ( mel brooks in one of many uninspired , and unfunny roles ) to send them a new sheriff to protect them . 

the governor pawns the task off to korman's character hedley lamarr . 

 ( i can tell you are rolling off your chairs right now just thinking of all the humor in that name . ) 

lamarr decides to send the town a black sheriff ( gasp ) in the hopes that the town will be so disgusted at the prospect of a black man living among them that they will all just leave . 

hold on , i've got to stop while these gales of laughter pass . 

it's just too funny . 

racism passing as humor -- gosh why didn't anybody ever think of that one before ? 

oh wait , i think somebody might have -- they are called the kkk . 

i'm not calling brooks a racist -- but i am calling him an insensitive bastard who wouldn't know what was funny if it hit him over the head . 

but i digress . 

anyway , the black sheriff rides into town amid a flurry of townsfolk using the n-word . 

golly , will the hilarity just never end ? 

he ends up joining forces with a drunk ( gene wilder ) , who happens to be the former fastest gun in the west . 

together , they save the day from evil . 

not one person in this movie gives a decent performance . 

wilder looks like he is recovering from a head injury for most of the movie , and korman looks embarrassed to be a part of the movie . 

ok , he really didn't -- but he should have . 

the films star cleavon little goes along with the black jokes as if they were discussing the time of day . 

i did not laugh once during this whole sorry experience . 

i admit to starting to snicker on a couple of occasions . 

actually , the end started to look as if it was going to have some promise , but alas , it ended up being as crappy as the rest of the movie . 

i can say with full confidence that blazing saddles has no redeeming qualities whatsoever . 

mel brooks would be doing the world a favor if he burned every last copy of this film . 
"
"an energetic , visually stunning , but intellectually hollow recreation of the mysterious life of jeanne d'arc . 

in history jeanne d'arc is lost in an ocean of mystery and controversy , which creates the perfect launching pad for talented and creative directors , who can basically alter the story as they wish . 

she came in a time where people desperately needed a saint . 

a hero that could rescue them for misery and deliver peace and happiness . 

director/writer luc besson ( 'nikita' , 'leon' ) portrays his version of the peasant girl who commanded the armies of france and was burned at the stake for witchcraft . 

besson tries to recreate the person behind the legend . 

he tries not to show her as a saint or a villain . 

he shows her as a human being . 

in a time where blood was almost pouring from the sky , and the air smelled of rotten flesh , it is hard to keep your sanity . 

the only support and hope is in god . 

at the age of 13 , jeanne ( milla jovovich ) watches her own sister murdered and raped by the english soldiers . 

this terrible event makes a lasting impact on jeanne's mind . 

god is no longer her support . 

he has become her obsession . 

she starts seeing visions and signs that command her to raise an army and free france from the siege of the english tyranny . 

with the help of the wise yolande d'aragon ( faye dunaway ) and charles vii ( john malcovich ) , whose grand royal ambitions and life are at stake , jeanne raises an army and marches towards the english walls . 

after this the film stays mostly on the battlefield , where besson demonstrates his ability to direct amazing action sequences , only occasionally resorting to a calmer tempo . 

the movie is filled with dreamy , symbolic images of pure artistic craftsmanship , that create a surreal and occasionally paranoiac atmosphere . 

the film is lost in time and space , hysterically jumping back and forth in jeanne's thoughts , imagination and conscience . 

besson's visual style permits the audience to enter the medieval age , feel the smell of fresh blood and the adrenaline pumping in your body in the heat of battle . 

but the film is far from being flawless . 

the script needs a lot of polishing . 

except for jeanne , there are no real characters . 

and although a grand star cast is assembled , their characters are nothing more than props , not more alive than the costumes that they are wearing . 

as for the maiden of lorraine herself , she is portrayed as a simple girl , too small for her divine task . 

in the latter part of the film , we see her as hysterical , confused and on the brink of madness , with her past purity and innocence for ever lost . 

jovovich handles the part with more panache than one might expect . 

but though her screen time is incredible excessive , both malcovich ( 'being john malcovich' ) and dunaway ( 'titus' ) surpass her rather overacted and simply unprofessional performance . 

and even hoffman manages to breathe some life into his dreadfully small part . 

besides casting jovovich , besson's only mistake is his extreme sense of patriotism that in the end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting . 

there are some viscously evil englishmen that murder , pillage and betray with a smile on their faces . 

and some incredibly brave and noble frenchmen , represented by the "" three musketeers "" of this story -- the brave gilles de rais ( vincent cassel ) , the wise aulon ( desmond harrington ) and the strong la hire ( richard ridings ) . 

though all those actor perform well , their characters are nothing more than symbols -- banners that proclaim the glory of france . 

and thus , there is no sense of realism in this film . 

'the messenger' has muscles instead of brains . 

there is some relief in the end , where besson lays down his armor and starts thinking . 

dustin hoffman's appearance helps and the film ends elegantly and surprisingly effective with a climax worthy of praise . 

jeanne's character is unlocked , but whether god was in the picture or not , is never quite explained . 

was she a confused peasant girl driven by her own hunger for revenge ? 

or was she truly a messenger of god ? 

the film poses as many questions as answers and nothing is completely obvious . 

bess o messenger' is nothing more than a fairly good film . 

it is not much that you remember of it after you leave the theater . 

maybe the sound , the dreamy sequences , but certainly not the dialogue . 

it is an elegant and adrenaline pumping history lesson for the mtv-generation , that although presents some interesting material , works better when it's on the battlefield . 
"
"the sheer horrific audacity of the nazi plan to exterminate the jews of europe is almost incomprehensible . 

people may make documentaries about it for another hundred years and still not understand the organized , methodical hatred . 

five concentration camp survivors from the last days of world war ii tell their stories in the last days , the first documentary from steven spielberg's survivors of the shoah visual history foundation . 

the five interviewees are linked by their hungarian ancestry . 

as the introduction explains , even as germany started to lose the war , the nazis stepped up their extermination of the jews in europe . 

in 1944 , hungary had the last big population of jews within germany's reach , and they became the last target of hitler's "" final solution . "" 

each of the five tells his or her story . 

their stories are intercut chronologically , starting from normal life in pre-war hungary . 

they recall the nazi invasion of hungary , being sent to "" work "" camps and their realization that they were actually in death camps . 

they recall their horrible , precarious lives in auschwitz and buchenwald ; the deaths of their family and friends ; their loss of hope . 

each recalls his or her unfathomable , eventual liberation . 

and finally , the last days shows their cathartic , pained , modern-day return to their old homes and the camps . 

needless to say , their stories are horrifying , amazing , and emotionally draining . 

by themselves , the stories would be forceful testaments , but by cutting them in parallel , their impact is multiplied by five . 

the last days is a talking-heads style documentary -- it's mostly pictures of people telling their stories , intercut with period photographs and newsreel footage . 

in this kind of movie it's almost impossible to get archival pictures from the same time and place being discussed on-screen , but director james moll made a better effort than most at finding specific , or at least relevant , images to go with his subjects' narration . 

the liner notes ( one of the many nice features of this dvd ) indicate that there is some never-before-seen historical footage in the last days . 

it's not clear which scene it is . 

it could be one of two that i hadn't seen before , both powerful . 

one is rare color footage , shot by an american , of piles of victims in cattle cars . 

there is something jarring , something unsettling about seeing the pictures in color , when so much of the footage from world war ii is in black and white . 

another segment shows walking skeletons ; survivors who are so starved that they hardly look human anymore . 

there has been a glut of holocaust movies and i was skeptical that a new documentary would have anything new to say . 

but by focusing on hungarian jews during the last days of the war , moll told a specific part of the story in a new way , in greater detail . 

and i'm glad he did because his careful filmmaking stands up well compared to other movies on the same subject . 

the transfer to dvd is rich and beautiful . 

x-mozilla-status : 0009f words for a holocaust documentary , but some of the interviews take place in europe in late spring , when skies are blue and trees are green . 

also , the movie was shot on 35mm film ( and not video ! ) , 

so the richness and detail are impeccable . 

the dvd's features are plentiful and well-chosen . 

there is a theatrical trailer for the movie , which is a great introduction to the subject matter . 

there are about fifty still photos , both from the production crew and from the private collections of the survivors . 

also , the disc has two complete versions of the movie ( widescreen and full screen ) , both on the same side . 

one of the more interesting dvd features is an outtake segment for each of the survivors ( plus one for the crew ) . 

you'd think outtakes would be inappropriate in a holocaust documentary , but they're not bloopers . 

instead , they are solid , moving segments that were probably cut from the film only for length . 

one of them continues a confrontation that was only touched on lightly in the film . 

renee firestone ( one of the five ) spoke on camera with dr . hans m ? nch , a german doctor who ran the medical clinic at auschwitz . 

firestone was aggressive , questioning the doctor about what his children thought . 

the doctor was evasive and clearly uncomfortable . 

another of the outtakes showed bill basch saying a prayer for his dead friends at auschwitz . 

he ends his prayer by saying "" . . . forgive me for surviving . "" 

it's ambitious to shoot a documentary on 35mm film . 

it's ambitious to make it on a subject that has saturated cable , television , and movies . 

it's ambitious to make it 54 years after the events it covers . 

but the last days handles all these potential obstacles very well . 

it's only fitting that the dvd , with its wealth of interesting and relevant features , would also be ambitious and successful .

"originally launched in 1978 , this popular film was re-introduced in 1998 to a whole new generation of moviegoers . 

based on the mighty successful musical from broadway , grease was followed in 1980 with the less stellar grease 2 ( 6 . 5/10 ) , 

starring a young michelle pheiffer in one of her first feature film roles . 

plot : high-school musical set in the 1950's showcasing the relationship between the cool danny zuko of the t-birds ( travolta ) and the innocent and pure sandy olsen ( newton-john ) from australia . 

the film follows the couple and their vivacious friends during their last year at rydell high through song , dance and humour . 

critique : fun-loving , energetic and innocent look back at times much simpler . 

this movie effectively juggles a thin romantic story line and the overall experience of the 1950's , with a superb soundtrack and some great dance numbers . 

admittedly , i am somewhat biased in this opinion , since this film blasts me into my past as a rebellious youth ( grease was one of schmoe's first big-screen experiences , and every other scene sends me reeling into the times of my elaborate grease bubble-gum card collection ) , and the lesser responsibilities that i possessed at that time . 

but apart from the nostalgic vibe , i was still extremely impressed by this film , as it continued to amuse me , despite my previous dozen or so viewings . 

this film took john travolta from a dim-witted "" sweathog "" on tv's welcome back kotter , and transformed him into a movie-star of spectacular proportions ( saturday night fever ( 7 . 5/10 ) in 1979 confirmed that sudden popularity ) . 

unfortunately for the rest of the cast , his popularity was not terribly contagious , despite their effective showings in this classic movie . 

on the down side , some of the absolute innocence in this film might bore or turn people off ( like when sandy sings about "" drinking lemonade "" and "" staying out until 10 "" with danny in "" summer nights "" ) , and the plot isn't exactly the most elaborate story-line ever created , but despite these small reservations , this movie carries enough great music and high energy to keep anyone amused through its rapid 110 minute running time ( and believe me . . . i 

am not a fan of the musicals ! ! ) . 

make sure to look for a young lorenzo lamas in the static role of the brainless football player , as well as the national bandstand dance contest as one of the film's absolute highlights . 

and don't forget to buy the popular soundtrack afterwards , so that you could listen to its peppy tunes whenever you're feeling a little blue . 

little known facts : henry winkler , of tv's happy days' fonzie fame , turned down the part of danny zuko because he did not want to be typecast for the rest of his career . 

both travolta and conaway were smitten by newton-john during the filming of this picture . 

conaway eventually bowed out of the woo-fest , and married newton-john's sister a year later ( divorced after five years ) . 
"
" "" no man is an island , "" one character quotes john donne in apt pupil , effectively summarizing the movie's themes . 

while hardly a great film , singer's ambitious adaptation of king's short story * is challenging nonetheless ; perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it . 

apt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses . 

1984 . wonder-bred high school honours student todd bowden ( renfro ) conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander , a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the 1960s and was never heard from again . 

bowden suspects arthur denker ( mckellan ) , the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby , is actually a pseudonymous dussander-much research and dusting for fingerprints proves young todd's theory . 

bowden strikes a deal with dussander : in exchange for not revealing his identity , dussander must satisfy bowden's intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view . 

the stories he hears keep todd up at night and haunt his daydreams , but like a bystander at a traffic accident , todd's desire for gory details overrides his repulsion . 

bowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii . 

marching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander : it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his "" student "" , among other things . 

bowden , who has taken on very hateful qualities ( he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook ) , engages the veteran in an endless game of one-upmanship . 

dussander stands to lose his freedom , and bowden his credibility-in effect , his post-secondary school future . 

all of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable ( and unsettling ) conclusion , one which requires leaps of faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source material's excessive climax . 

singer has yet to get keyser s ? ze out of his system . 

his the usual suspects and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence ( verbal's tics and todd's golden-boy reputation are plausible ruses ) ; they showcase morally bankrupt anti-heroes to whom telling the truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals . 

apt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects , a movie famous and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcome-there was no way you could see the ending coming , as it was all a hoodwink , anyway . 

thankfully , singer has gotten most of the usual suspects' film-schoolish geek theatrics out of his system . 

some scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected and/or obvious ( the dream sequences were extraneous ) , but the majority of the film is subdued-and singer's handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murderer-in-training . 

mckellan's and renfro's performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film ; while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellan's finely-tuned realization , i'd like to single out renfro's daring work . 

he isn't afraid to play someone largely unappealing and cold-hearted ; he strips his character of vanity , something many of his peers wouldn't do . 

 ( can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor-thomas in the same role ? ) 

renfro was recently charged with possession of cocaine-i hope he doesn't continue down that path , because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him . 

as guidance counsellor edward french , "" friend "" schwimmer also deserves mention . 

he wants to be the parent to todd that todd's own well-to-do folks are not ( todd , like most modern kids-and only-children-has mom and dad wrapped around his pinky finger ) , and his sincerity makes the apt pupil's blackening-heart even more apparent . 

but one of the film's ultimate questions , are we born evil or do we learn evil ? , might be answered in french , whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous . 

no man is an island , indeed-we all have the capacity to make the "" right "" or the "" wrong "" choices . 

schwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible . 

-october , 1998 

 * the excellent collection king's stories called different seasons spawned not only apt pupil , but the shawshank redemption ( originally titled rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption ) and stand by me ( originally titled the body ) . 
"
"in double jeopardy , the stakes are high . 

think of the plot as a rehash of sleeping with the enemy , and then rearrange the details and the gender of the stalker . 

the finished product , although able to maintain the viewer's attention , is a predictable and unexciting thriller with an idiotic script . 

`alex , i'll take homicide for $400 . . . ' 

libby parsons ( ashley judd ) is a happily married mom leading a normal life . 

one night , her husband nick ( bruce greenwood ) takes her out for a romantic escape on a sailboat . 

libby awakens in the middle of the night to find she is covered in blood and nick has strangely disappeared . 

she follows a trail of bloody footprints up to the deck , where she handles a fallen knife ( like any stupid character ) and is spotted by the coast guard , who are responding to a distress signal sent earlier in the evening . 

nick is presumed dead , and although she pleads her innocence , libby is tried and convicted for the murder of her husband . 

now , please don't think i'm spoiling any vital plot details , because the informative trailer has already spilled most of the beans . 

if you haven't seen this preview , don't read any further . 

but seriously , the inane screenplay by douglas weisberg and douglas s . cook is so elementary that the average viewer will be two or three steps ahead of the characters . 

during the most vital scenes in the movie , i was anticipating every twist or `surprise' that eventually popped up on the screen . 

i imagine the writers presume their core audience for double jeopardy is a very naive group of individuals . 

most , unfortunately , will be too distracted by the moronic plot to appreciate the few positive aspects of the production . 

one is tommy lee jones , who plays travis lehman , a parole officer given the tedious task of watching over libby after she serves her sentence in prison . 

jones is always wonderful as an authority figure , and he's certainly familiar with this sort of role ( as he played so well in the fugitive and us marshals ) . 

judd , as a likable heroin with gusto , also has a chance to flex her acting abilities . 

while emotionally unconvincing , the actress is tremendously fun in her juvenile role , perking up the movie like an injection of anti-depressant . 

the actors , and their relationship together , present the one-two punch that prevents double jeopardy from derailing itself entirely . 

and now , back to the plot . 

while behind bars , libby learns an interesting little bit of information : a person can't be convicted of the same crime twice . 

this law , called `double jeopardy' , could be her motive for hunting down her husband . . . 

who may still be alive . 

yes , you heard right . 

the movie degenerates into a cross-country chase , where everything you expect to happen . . . 

does . 

the final scenes , which could have redeemed the film , are poorly handled by director bruce beresford - whose previous work centers highly around drama ( driving miss daisy , paradise road ) . 

ironically , it is those elements - like the driving force of libby to reunite with her son - that don't quite work here . 

at least double jeopardy is paced well enough to satisfy diehard fans of the two stars . 

unfortunately , jones lacks some of the edge that he had as sam gerard in the fugitive , and the real depth of his character is only skin deep . 

but he and ashley judd are more than welcome considering the material , and both have some memorable comic moments . 

judd , in particular , has a hilarious scene in which she wards off an oncoming male by explaining she has to check in with her `parole officer' . 

hmmm . . . 

perhaps this would have made a good comedy . 

it is disappointing , because there are the makings of a competent action film here . 

it's nicely shot and choreographed in downtown vancouver , and will entertain those who aren't turned off by the woeful story-line . 

 ? tis a shame that double jeopardy is an adult thriller that wouldn't fool most children .

"my filmcritic . com 

colleague norm schrager nailed session 9 , brad anderson's throwback to spooky horror films from the 70's . 

it worked as an eerie homage without being self-referential or smugly postmodern . 

genre aficionados will acknowledge the similarities in tone to stanley kubrick's the shining and george romero's dawn of the dead without being taken out of the engrossing narrative ( i . e . , a psychologically addled waste management team clears out an abandoned lunatic asylum ; unspeakable dread ensues ) . 

in a double-whammy for 2001 , anderson shoots and ( mostly ) scores again with his eclectic riff on time-travel episodes from the twilight zone , appropriately titled happy accidents . 

much like session 9 , the cards are played very close to the vest here . 

is boyish , eccentric "" sam deed from dubuque , iowa "" a futuristic voyager from the year 2470 or just your run-of-the-mill psychologically disturbed nutcase let loose on the present-day streets of nyc ? 

as played by wonderful character actor vincent d'onofrio ( full metal jacket ) , it's up in the air whether or not we should accept his detailed monologues about life after the polar ice caps have melted . 

the question proves to be moot , at least for a time . 

even if the whole thing proves to be a creative delusion , one agrees with the character judgment passed down on him by his new girlfriend , ruby ( marisa tomei ) : "" he's a freak , but he sure tells a good story ! "" 

neurotic ruby thinks she may have found true love after a series of nightmarish dating disasters ( the junkie , the fetishist , the artist , the frenchman , etc . ) , but isn't quite sure how to handle "" sam deed "" when he starts explaining the barcode on his arm , his elaborately constructed fake identity , his pathological fear of dogs , his ability to speak five different languages , and his mission to change a crucial moment in time that may have ramifications on time's alternate realities . 

 ( don't ask . ) 

it's all a bit much to take in . 

ruby's close friend gretchen ( cuz ya can't have a love story without the token friend , though nadia dajani invests the thankless role with warmth ) chalks it up as a sexy role-playing game , but her cautious therapist ( holland taylor ) warns her that co-dependency is rearing its ugly head again and she's in over her head with yet another doomed relationship . 

who ya gonna believe ? 

despite her winning an academy award , marisa tomei has always struck me as an annoying and unwelcome screen presence , one that undermines the pleasure of watching happy accidents . 

her brassy new yawk attitude never really meshes with her desperate desire to appear "" cute "" to her adoring fans . 

being loud and flashing a ( disingenuous ) smile does not necessarily equal "" substantial and sexy . "" 

it takes more than a crack team of hair and wardrobe people to imbue her with personality . 

then there's that damned voice , which strains to be oh-so-adorable . 

look , this stuff is purely subjective . 

some people feel this way about richard gere , others cannot bear to watch robin williams' hyperactive schtick . 

for my money , it's m . tomei with a bullet . 

happy accidents is a romantic comedy filtered through twelve monkeys ( or , more appropriately , chris marker's la jetee , especially with those still framed "" memory "" photographs anderson employs as a stylistic device throughout ) . 

modern manhattan is filmed with an otherworldly , vaguely alien eye with a color scheme oddly reminiscent of logan's run . 

as the stranger in a strange land , d'onofrio walks slightly out-of-step , wonderfully affable but often inscrutable with his wayward expressions and bemused detachment . 

this is science fiction told mainly via the power of suggestion ( though it often falls into the sci-fi trap of having entirely too much forced exposition -- we want deeds , not words ! ) 

at least twenty minutes too long , happy accidents eventually gets around to a race-against-time scenario that puts "" sam deed "" to the ultimate test . 

no movie can live in ambiguity forever , but anderson seems terminally unable to provide satisfactory conclusions to his otherwise well structured recent narratives . 

 ( let's pretend the loathsome and predictable next stop wonderland never happened , shall we ? ) 

there are also some slow , repetitive stretches as ruby and sam go over the same arguments again and again over whether or not he's crazy . 

the premise is strong enough to sustain interest , but it's enough to throw a nod in the general direction of rod serling for wrapping up his ideas in half-hour time slots , commercials included .

"plot : based on the wildly popular "" jerry springer "" tv show , this movie follows the lives of two groups of people before they make their bizarre appearances on the infamous program . 

one posse comes from the trailer parks and are to be featured in the "" i slept with my stepfather "" segment , and the other is based on some fly-girl whose girlfriends keep sleeping with her undevoted "" dog "" boyfriend . 

critique : the truth is that if i didn't have a day job , i would probably watch the real "" jerry springer "" show every day . 

i find it quite entertaining , despite its complete lack of redeeming value . 

having said that , the show itself is outrageous , funny , and always filled with goofy surprises , as opposed to this film which features no laughs ( is this a comedy or a drama ? ) , uninteresting and completely unbelievable one-dimensional stereotypes , and a contrived plot which bores us stupid all the way . 

i never thought i would utter the word boring in the same sentence as jerry springer , but this film is an absolute yawn-fest , despite offering various scenes featuring simulated blowjobs , lesbians , t&a and tv violence ( who would've guessed that ? ) . 

i wish they would have either a ) made this movie much , much funnier , or b ) turned it into a complete drama and given us a real perspective as to why people like this actually put themselves through these public forums of embarrassment . 

unfortunately , it doesn't seem as though screenwriter jon bernstein spent more than a drunken weekend watching real "" jerry springer "" reruns to complete his script , leaving us with a boring film , featuring no laughs , one-dimensional characters , and no fun whatsoever . 

little known facts about this film and its stars : jerry springer used to be the mayor of cincinnati , ohio . 

for this film , he won the 1999 razzie award for worst new star , tied with joe esterhas from an alan smithee film : burn hollywood burn .

"steven spielberg's "" amistad , "" which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship , then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who "" owned "" them , is concerned with several different aspects of this story . 

first , the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery . 

second , it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case , including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) . 

last , and most importantly , it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade . 

 "" amistad "" succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements . 

i have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another "" anti-slavery "" movie . 

having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery , i doubted that there was much i didn't already know about it . 

fortunately , i turned out to be wrong . 

for one thing , spielberg's camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders' operations in africa , so "" amistad "" was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning . 

and some of the images here are , in fact , much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery . 

one scene in the middle , in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their "" excess "" slaves by throwing them overboard to drown , has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year . 

spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would , and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc-17 rating . 

the stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians , such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain , whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time . 

exposing politicians as narrow-minded , opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff , of course , but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation . 

the film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time , such that john quincy adams ( and probably other politicians like him ) , who clearly disapproved of the practice , was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court . 

the biggest success of "" amistad "" is probably the characterization of cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , the lawyer who represents them in court . 

through cinque , we are given a window into the native culture , as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member , or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ . 

cinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that , again , contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles . 

 "" what kind of country is this , where laws 'almost' work ? "" he asks baldwin in bewilderment , when he learns that the case must be re-tried before the supreme court . 

spielberg's direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times , such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque's angry outburst in the court room . 

still , there isn't enough of this for it to be a serious problem . 

the main flaw in this film , which prevents it from earning four stars , is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni can't quite handle all of these issues at the same time , so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie . 

this summer's contact , for example , dealt with several issues at once , but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and , most importantly , all of them were resolved at once . 

 "" amistad "" tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams , but it somehow feels a little forced , and in any case the speech itself , which lasts almost fifteen minutes , wears out its welcome about halfway through . 

perhaps the best way to describe it is this : "" amistad "" is three four star films edited into one . 

almost every individual scene works , but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence , and thus is less than the sum of its parts . 

however , i can't honestly say how it could have been done differently , and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film , and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery .

"synopsis : in this cultural exploration , a chinese american computer engineer named fang ( peter wang ) decides to take a month-long vacation to visit his sister mrs . chao ( shen guanglan ) , her husband mr . chao ( hy xiaoguang ) , and their teenage daughter lili ( li qinqin ) in beijing after 30 years of separation . 

fang brings his asian american wife grace ( sharon iwai ) and his college-aged son paul ( kelvin han yee ) along , both of whom don't speak chinese . 

the encounter between the two families allows the audience to compare the eastern and western cultures as well as the ambitions of individual characters . 

opinion : sometimes a film is plot driven . 

sometimes it's a character sketch . 

a great wall ( 1986 ) can be called a culture sketch , as opposed to a character sketch because it gently compares a chinese american family to a beijing family . 

fang's family is thoroughly americanized . 

fang is an upper middle class professional who enjoys jogging and argues with his boss . 

his wife can't cook chinese . 

his son has a white girlfriend and complains of racism when fang encourages him to befriend an asian girl . 

meanwhile fang's beijing sister advocates absolute loyalty to the 'work unit . ' 

her husband is a retired official who has heard rumors of american depravity ( homosexuals running the streets ) , and her daughter lili longs for american freedoms in a youth culture where studying for college entrance exams is the most important thing in life . 

the two families spend a month slowly learning about each other . 

there is no ultimate 'answer' or final comprehensive understanding after the month-long vacation . 

the film is neither here nor there ; it's a neutral , meandering , gentle , portrait of life on both sides .

"i have never been a "" star trek "" fan , and , to tell the truth , out of the five films in the series that i have seen ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 9 ) , i have disliked all of them . 

i do , however , always go into one of these with an open mind , and the ninth film in the series , "" star trek : insurrection , "" is no exception . 

dropping almost completely the hard-core sci-fi element of the previous one in the series , "" first contact , "" "" insurrection , "" tells the story of a planet that holds only 600 people , known as the ba'ku , as well as the fountain of youth . 

at the start of the picture , the villagers go under attack by a second alien species , known as the son'a , who want to push all of the ba'ku out so that their own race will not die out . 

also attacking the ba'ku is data ( brent spiner ) , a robot from the star trek enterprise . 

after returning to jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the gang on their space ship , no one can understand why data was somehow taken over by another force . 

so several of the star trek members travel down to the planet of the ba'ku , where picard meets up and starts to fall in love with one of the inhabitants , a sultry , kind alien woman ( donna murphy ) , who is over six-hundred-years-old , but looks to only be in her thirties . 

 "" star trek : insurrection , "" is a completely unoriginal and cheap-looking installment in the series , and is a big step down from , 1996's "" first contact , "" which at least appeared to try to make something a bit different . 

in , "" insurrection , "" however , it plays like a low-rent episode of the television show , due to the small-scale , generic storyline , and an emphasis on one-liners rather than excitement . 

the film was filled with nearly non-stop comedy , and worse yet , most of it fell flatter than a cartoon character that drops off a cliff . 

meanwhile , when there were action sequences , they were not at all interesting or inventive , relying on that old reliable ticking timer that counts down very , very slowly . 

this plot device , which is seen in just about every action film made nowadays , is getting old fast . 

are filmmakers so bankrupt of ingenuity and ideas that they must always have a timer ticking away during the climax ? 

another element of , "" star trek , "" films in general is that picard seems to always have to have a love interest , but then she always miraculously disappears when the next film is made two or three years later . 

although donna murphy , who falls victim to this thankless love interest role here , is actually one of the few characters that we get to know in the 103-minute running time , alfre woodard was far superior in , "" first contact . "" 

she should have returned for this one , but i don't blame her for not wanting to waste her time with this movie's disappointing and often lifeless screenplay , by michael piller . 

 "" star trek : insurrection , "" is perhaps the weakest film in the "" star trek , "" series , although i have not seen what is widely considered the worst , "" star trek v : the final frontier . "" 

 "" insurrection , "" is the type of "" safe "" sequel that will bewilder non-fans , since it is so low-tech compared to most of today's blockbuster action films ( although most of these are honestly not very good , either ) , and should disappoint the loyal trekkies , since it could have easily been better if the makers had realized that the screenplay needed to go through a few more drafts . 

on second thought , they probably should have completely thrown the script out . 

that way , they could have come up with a story that at least had a sign of intelligence and freshness . 
"
"the people who populate the movie 54 are shallow , self-absorbed and self-indulgent . 

in other words , they perfectly mirror the era as well as the movie this feature depicts . 

54 is the story of that well-publicized new york disco , studio 54 , the in-place in the '70s where anybody who was anybody went to be ogled , photographed and pampered . 

the difficulty with 54 , which was written and directed by mark christopher , is that his script takes no point of view . 

christopher neither condemns nor glorifies the legendary excesses that were studio 54's hallmark . 

he keeps an uninvolved distance , thus keeping us from forming any emotional attachment with any of the protagonists . 

the movie's one main asset is the surprising performance by mike myers as steve rubell , the famous owner of the nightspot . 

he is part rebel , part dreamer , part shrewd entrepreneur . 

he's smart enough and childlike enough to pander to the dreams and desires of his clientele , yet stupid enough to brag on tv about hiding profits from the irs . 

myers , in his first straight character part , is in turn appealing and appalling . 

at one moment he can try to pressure a male employee into a sexual situation , then at the next moment apologize for his bad behavior and offer the young man a handful of cash . 

the story is told by shane o'shea ( ryan phillippe ) , a new jersey lad who dreams of crossing the river to the big apple . 

shades of john travolta's brooklyn-bound tony in saturday night fever . 

eventually , shane does come to new york , attracts rubell's eye and is admitted to the promised land . 

his looks get him a job as a busboy , and he is later promoted to the prestigious position of bartender , where he mixes with and makes drinks for the rich and famous . 

shane's dream is to meet soap star julie black ( neve campbell ) , a fellow garden stater . 

but both characters are so sketchily drawn that even when they do hook up , it's no big deal . 

the chemistry between shane and julie is nonexistent . 

54 is a very cold , uninvolving movie . 

it's all strobe lights and glitz , all substance . 

it's sort of like the musical era it covers . 
"
"remember back in the mid 1990s when crime and macabre movies were all the rage ? 

 "" pulp fiction "" and "" fargo "" both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture , and not surprisingly , a slew of rip-offs followed in the years thereafter . 

that fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing "" the way of the gun "" that at first glance looks like another of those wanna-be's but upon closer inspection doesn't look like anything comprehendable . 

it's a crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere - a film that won't allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous . 

complexity should come as no surprise to anyone who's familiar with mcquarrie , he wrote "" the usual suspects , "" which has become a cult favorite despite little critical acclaim . 

that film had a great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate , confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings . 

you have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that "" if it's really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating . "" 

with "" the way of the gun "" mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea , but this time the story is far less commercial - a shame because maybe that would have helped . 

the film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely a reason to live but aren't hell-bent on death either ( played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro ) . 

they get lucky when they hear about a scheme between a big-shot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have a baby through in vitro fertilization . 

they figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother ( played by juliette lewis ) and get a nice ransom . 

along the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec , his wife , their hired goons and the "" bag man "" ( played by james caan - the only actor in the film who looks like he knows what he's doing ) . 

the exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously can't call the authorities for help . 

his goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers' trail and each make different offers to get the mother back . 

the exec's son is a doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right . 

meanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the double-crosses , secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all . 

mcquarrie doesn't know the meaning of the word simple . 

he seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making a good movie . 

everything has to be complicated and confusing , so much so that it's to the point of surrealism . 

nothing is what it seems in this reality , it's one of those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected to know most of the industry's rules and regulations . 

every scene with caan's character exemplifies this perfectly - the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him , getting into conversations about "" the business "" and how it works and we're hardly given a clue as to what they're talking about . 

these characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but they're more like ideas ripped-off from sketches found in david mamet's trash . 

no one here really acts like a real person , and the story is even further removed from reality . 

it's like a dream without any appeal . 

take the opening scene for example ; the phillipe and del toro characters are in a parking lot across the street from a bar or a club counting their money and stuff . 

they sit on a brand-new mercedes and the car alarm goes off , the owner is waiting in line and yells at them to get away from his car but they don't move . 

the guy and his loud-mouth , potty-mouth girlfriend and about 20 other people cross the street and gang up on them . 

you'd think phillipe ? and del toro are ? going to pull out guns and scare them away but they don't , instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by a mob . 

there's a lot of things i didn't understand about this scene : first of all the owner of the mercedes isn't some yuppie or old rich snob , he's like a hippie straight out of the 60s . 

secondly , the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed . 

lastly , it serves no purpose in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery than a small country's army . 

if they were suicidal they wouldn't have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place ( and where they get all those guns is never explained either ) . 

there's a lot more i could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility . 

what it all comes down to is that nothing here is what it seems - which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is . 

absolutely none of the characters are likable or believable . 

and it's all coated with a thin layer of black comedy which is good for a chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not a flat-out black comedy and its use of such seems like a desperate attempt to kill screen time . 

with any film you see , whether you like it or not , you can at least understand what the appeal was to it , why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it . 

i can't say either for "" the way of the gun , "" because it has very little going for it and i can't imagine anyone intelligently defending it . 
"
"at the end of an action scene in "" lara croft : tomb raider , "" a wall collapses near the nubile warrior . 

with her face on the floor , she gazes into the rubble , then grins abruptly and says "" oh , my car keys ! "" 

i mention this scene because it was the only moment in the whole damned production that made me smile . 

based on an incredibly popular video game , "" lara croft : tomb raider "" is a lousy movie . 

the structure goes like this : poorly-staged action sequence , boring exposition , poorly-staged action sequence , boring exposition , etc . etc . , the end . 

basically , the film exists to showcase angelina jolie's puffy lips and enhanced tits . 

close-ups are framed oh-so-carefully to include her million dollar bazooms . 

running scenes highlight her bouncing breasts in vintage "" baywatch "" fashion . 

there's even include a shower scene that offers a brief side view of them . 

but the filmmakers are so inept they can't even flash the audience correctly . 

the one extended display of nudity is of - get ready for this - a guy . 

for no particular reason , a muscular supporting character strolls around naked for about 30 seconds , with each shot composed to barely cover his package , ? la "" austin powers . "" 

now , i enjoy a good looking male body as much as the next gay guy , but what the hell is beefcake doing in a t&a flick aimed at heterosexual males ? 

of course , what else should one expect in a film that does virtually nothing right ? 

 "" tomb raider "" sets up elaborate action set pieces , then renders them incomprehensible with needless jump cut editing ( a promising dual bungee cord battle is ruined by excessive cuts ) . 

it promises a series of exotic locales , then delivers cavernous sets and grimy matte paintings with smoggy skies . 

throw in some bargain basement computer graphics and you end up with the ugliest movie to come down the pike in many moons . 

intended to be a rousing "" indiana jones "" style adventure , "" tomb raider "" lacks any sense of tension . 

the low point comes when lara is "" threatened "" by statues of monkey warriors and a giant multi-armed shiva figure that come to life courtesy of cgi . 

easily the lamest menaces i have ever seen , the creatures move like snails and fall apart with a single shot from a gun . 

if you ever have to be chased by monsters , pray that you get the monkey warriors . 

 "" tomb raider "" tells a story , sort of . 

once every 5 , 000 years , the planets align . 

a group of very bad men are out to find two halves of an object that , if reassembled just as the planets align , will give them control over time itself . 

lara's goal is to stop them and rescue her long-missing poppa ( jon voight , jolie's real life dad ) . 

none of this matters though , because stunning gaps in internal logic assure that the plot of "" lara croft : tomb raider "" is as lame as ever other aspect of the film ? except angelina jolie's lips and breasts . 
"
"`run lola run' , a german import that gained a stellar reputation at the sundance film festival , is a dazzling and kinetic film that deals with the subjects of fate and chance . 

for a berserk and retroactive 81 minutes of non-stop movement , we follow a fiery-haired heroine named lola ( franka potente ) as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the clutches of drug dealers . 

lola has roughly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve 100 , 000 marks in time to save manni ( moritz bleibtreu ) from being killed by the dealer . 

but , in something of a pseudo- `groundhog day' approach , director tom tykwer gives lola three separate chances to best navigate her way toward the goal . 

in these trio of episodes , we gradually learn the unique effects of fate , for even if tiny changes are made in lola's journey , the future can be seriously altered . 

`run lola run' is an experience like `fight club' or `the matrix' , in that each film takes you through a super-charged wormhole of bending reality in surreal and exciting ways . 

in addition , all three movies have a visual style that separates them from the rest of the pack . 

`lola' is no exception , with stylish quick-flash camera work and cinematography that serves as scintillating eye candy from the get-go . 

tykwer's world is a landscape of mood and color , with brilliant shades of red and pink ( including lola's fiery hair ) used as effective symbolism throughout . 

with it's visual style and mind-blowing pace , `run lola run' is one of the more invigorating movies of the year . 

even more so when considering the fact it's all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an 81-minute time period . 

as a heroine , potente does little more than run wildly through the streets ( as the title suggests ) , but she has a certain flair and charisma . 

her exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually a track star . 

meanwhile , bleibtreu does an equally fantastic job of bringing the dopey but passionate manni to life . 

both actors perform beyond the call of duty . 

the dazzling fun comes from predicting what each episode holds in store for lola , and the outcome is ultimately rewarding - several twists and turns are unique and unexpected . 

the other characters lola runs into ( both purposely and inadvertently ) include her banker father ( herbert kraup ) and a friendly security guard ( armin rohde ) , but aside from the two leads , no one has more than a few minutes of screen time . 

additional stars that couldn't possibly be ignored are cinematographer frank griebe and editor mathilde bonnefroy , who are both responsible for the film's eye-catching visual elegance . 

`run lola run' is subtitled , so be prepared to meet the challenge of reading the lightning-fast dialogue - occasional sections of it are especially fast . 

this is only one of the minor chores involved in watching . 

the other is the sense that we never get to really recognize who the real people are in this hyperactive situation . 

most are just chess pieces in tykwer's elaborate game of visual presentation , and he never really makes a significant move with any . 

but , the average viewer is likely to be so absorbed in the action that few will realize the lack of potency in a few elements of the screenplay . 

a few petty gripes aside , this film is a wild , exhilarating ride that turns maniacally on its wheel of originality . 

most people believe foreign films are mainly boring , talky character studies . 

perhaps `run lola run' will recharge their batteries . 

not only does this film offer insight into some intriguing questions of fate and destiny , it also delivers a white-knuckle visual rollercoaster ride of overwhelming audacity . 

like how the experience must have been for the persistent title character , `run lola run' is exhausting .

"in december of 1996 , a little movie called "" scream , "" was released , became a box-office smash , and resurrected films targeted at teens . 

first , it was teen slasher movies that were the big fad ( both "" scream "" movies , "" i know what you did last summer , "" "" urban legend , "" etc . ) , but just recently , the popularity has switched over to the teen comedy genre ( a 'la '80s john hughes ) , starting with last june's "" can't hardly wait . "" 

it may be the first week of april in 1999 , but so far this year we have been given a movie aimed at the 25-and-under market almost every single week : "" varsity blues , "" "" jawbreaker , "" "" cruel intentions , "" "" simply irresistible , "" "" the rage : carrie 2 , "" and "" the mod squad . "" 

coming april 9 are two more of this type : "" never been kissed "" and "" go , "" and on april 23 , we've got the teen satire "" election "" and the teen horror-comedy "" idle hands . "" 

jeesh ! 

out of all of these moves , however , the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation , "" 10 things i hate about you , "" is this past january's mediocre , ho-hum "" she's all that . "" 

although similar in plotting ( ok , darn near identical ) , "" 10 things i hate about you , "" a modern-day version of shakespeare's "" the taming of the shrew "" ( "" she's all that "" got its inspiration from "" pygmalion "" ) , is an infinitely superior film in every department , from the smart direction by first-time feature director gil junger to the charming and well-written screenplay by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith to the striking ensemble cast , who give the best group of performances in a teen comedy since 1985's "" the breakfast club . "" 

and to top it all off , in the inevitable climax set at the prom , at least we didn't have to once again suffer through a goofy , inappropriate dance sequence ( who could forget , or want to remember , for that matter , this ludicrous development in "" she's all that ? "" ) . 

the day wide-eyed , shy new student cameron james ( joseph gordon-levitt ) starts school at seattle-based padua high , he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore , bianca stratford ( larisa oleynik ) . 

although he doesn't know french , he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her , but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father ( larry miller ) won't allow her to date until her bitter , unconventional older sister , kat ( julia stiles ) , a senior , decides to . 

kat , of course , has sworn off the likes of boys , but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her , which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona ( heath ledger ) . 

complicating matters , cameron's dorky friend , michael ( david krumholtz ) , decides to use a wealthy jock , joey ( andrew keegan ) , who also has his sights set on bianca , as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him , and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey . 

as you can see , "" 10 things i hate about you "" includes a huge number of characters , some of which i haven't even mentioned , such as kat's shakespeare-obsessed friend , mandella ( susan may pratt ) and bianca's materialistic comrade , chastity ( gabrielle union ) . 

at a short , but well-used running time of 98 minutes , all of the characters are perfectly handled , satisfyingly developed , and , for the most part , are not treated as caricatures ( another flaw of "" she's all that , "" where the bad guys ( and gals ) ran around constantly saying , "" you're vapor "" ) . 

since i could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters , and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective , i got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained . 

aside from a good screenplay , it's the performances that can make or break a movie , and director junger has really hit the jackpot . 

aside from joseph gordon-levitt ( "" 3rd rock from the sun "" ) , who gives his strongest performance to date here , none of the actors are that well-known , but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to the proceedings . 

as the main character of kat , julia stiles ( last seen in the miniseries "" the '60s "" ) is marvelous and always believable , and certainly has a bright future ahead of her . 

even though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hard-edged , it was easy to identify with kat's way of thinking ( she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath ) , and i completely admired her individuality . 

no one , i think , could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does . 

heath ledger , as the infamous bad-boy of the town , injects much life into patrick , and has a lot of chemistry with stiles . 

one other actor of note is larisa oleynik who , with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith , is able to turn bianca into a person with multi-dimensions , even though she is accurately self-centered at the on-set . 

in one truthful scene , cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish , and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes , she has . 

one off-beat element of the film , and a source of some hearty laughs , is the way that the school's staff act , which is strikingly unformal . 

allison janney , as the guidance counselor ms . perky , who is writing a trashy harlequin romance novel , is comic dynamite , as is daryl "" chill "" mitchell as the english teacher , who reads shakespeare to the class in rap and , at one point , sends kat to the office because , for once , she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good . 

although there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning , most of it actually works , especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters . 

in one very funny scene , chastity asks , "" i know people can be overwhelmed , and they can be underwhelmed , but can people just be . . . whelmed ? "" 

at another point , bianca and kat's father ( a stand-out larry miller ) , who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant , only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion : before she leaves , she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what it's like to be pregnant . 

 "" 10 things i hate about you "" once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre , and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the '90s . 

it also helps that the movie has a perfectly-assembled soundtrack , mixing indie-rock with new wave '80s songs ( and with , thank goodness , no rap ) . 

by the film's end , it actually had me rooting for certain characters to get together , and i was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped up , especially in the final scenes involving kat and bianca , kat and her father , and a flawlessly-acted and moving sequence in which kat gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class ( this is where the title comes from ) . 

luckily , i doubt i would be able to find ten things i hate about "" 10 things i hate about you , "" but the positive aspects of the film far out-number ten .

"it was only a matter of time before a dilbert-esque office comedy hit the screens . 

however , rather than coming from dilbert creator scott adams , office space is instead based on the work of another animator , mike judge , creator of beavis and butthead and king of the hill . 

in his live-action directoral debut , judge aptly spoofs corporate culture . 

the story is certainly not very involved , but there is plenty of truth and humor to fill the gaps . 

peter ( ron livingston ) is a programmer working at the initech corporation . 

every day in his mundane life is worse than the one before . . . in

everything has simply made him a complete , nervous wreck . 

but all of that changes when , after an unintentionally over-effective visit to a hypnotherapist , peter loses all of his inhibitions . 

he realizes his lifelong dream : to do absolutely nothing . 

he begins to blatantly disregard the nonsensical instructions of his boss , bill lumbergh ( gary cole ) , doing whatever he feels like . 

peter's friends and co-workers , samir ( ajay naidu ) and michael bolton ( david herman ) . . . no , 

not that michael bolton , are perplexed by their friend's sudden change in attitude . 

but , they have larger things to worry about : rumors about that initech is about to begin downsizing . . . 

as bleak as much of this sounds , let me assure you that office space is a comedy , and quite a funny one . 

although it shares the same absurdist office humor of the dilbert comic strip , office space is actually based loosely on the series of milton cartoons which aired on saturday night life . 

each mundane detail , taken by itself , seems completely , regrettably , plausible . 

yet , when combined into a whole , the picture which results is absolutely surreal . 

ron livingston tackles his role straight-faced , and becomes much funnier because of it . 

his character isn't simply being a clown lampooning around the office , but rather seems possessed by a zen-like clarity . 

he is operating on a higher plane , where everything suddenly makes sense , and from this vantage point , he allows the audience to smirk at the absurdities of life . 

anyone who has had to deal with the inefficiencies of corporate bureaucracy , or who has ever been frustrated with the technology of modern life , will recognize many of the characters and situations in the film . 

in fact , in addition to being wildly humorous , the film may actually prove to be cathartic . 

the animated roots of office space show in the film's lack of complexity . 

most of the characters in the film can be quickly summarized by a particular personality quirk . 

one employee , milton ( stephen root ) , is practically a flesh-and-blood cartoon . 

however , despite their simple nature , the characters still manage to be surprisingly funny . 

it's not required to have a corporate background to enjoy this film ( though the situations may seem exceedingly far-fetched if you are unfamiliar with just how close to reality they really are ) . 

the film is flimsy and absurd , but also very funny .

" "" virus "" is the type of cliched , vacuous film that has been recylcled so many times before that you wonder why anyone would even bother putting work into making it . 

strangely enough , on the same mid-january weekend last year , another film was released like this , "" deep rising , "" about an ugly monster on a cruise liner . 

prior movies with the almost exact same storyline include 1989's "" leviathan , "" 1989's "" deep star six , "" and all four "" alien "" pictures . 

 "" virus , "" in comparison , is a servicable thriller , well-made and produced , but since it doesn't include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence , it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on . 

based on a series of comic books , "" virus "" concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat , which becomes extremely damaged during a violent typhoon . 

after discovering that the boat is slowly sinking , ( un ) lucky for them , a huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns up within the confines of their radar screen . 

once the team reaches the russian ship , they go on board to find that the place is seemingly deserted . 

after turning the power back on , however , there gradually are signs that something else is on the ship , and the electrical equipment is oddly working by itself . 

one survivor finally does turn up , nadia ( joanna pacula ) , who informs the suicidal and stern captain ( donald sutherland ) and one of the crew , kit foster ( jamie lee curtis ) , that a mysterious alien life form hit the santi mir space station which then was transported down to the ship , taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines and thinking that humans are viruses that should be completely wiped out . 

if "" virus "" sounds like all of the previously mentioned movies , you're correct . 

although the technical artistry is fairly impressive to bring the mechanical creature to life , the film itself doesn't appear to have a brain in its head . 

the film sticks so close to the worn-out conventions of the "" creature "" genre that it is amazing anyone would spend the money and time filming it when they could be making an original film . 

the actors are all very good and have all proven their acting abilities in the past , but they are sorely wasted here and do not really even have characters to play . 

in her second return to horror in the last year , jamie lee curtis once again proves to be a strong and resourceful heroine , but that is about it . 

although 1998's "" halloween : h20 "" was also a disappointment , at least she was given a few scenes to develop a character , unlike here . 

donald sutherland has fallen on hard times recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films , such as 1994's "" the puppet masters , "" although i just watched him in the superb 1978 sci-fi classic "" invasion of the body snatchers , "" where he was fabulous . 

the last of the three top-billers is william baldwin , but it is fairly hard to say if he is good or not in the picture , since he has nothing to do . 

basically , "" virus "" is another one of those films where a group of people walk around and investigate a space ship/ocean liner/haunted house until the deadly and equally grotesque and slimy creature pops up and kills them one-by-one . 

it is not the worst of its type , but it is far from one of the best , and when exactly are studios going to give up recycling such shameless and overdone plot gimmicks such as this ? 

as long as some of them keep making money , i suspect the answer is never .

"how could a g-rated disney film based on meg cabot's novel "" the princess diaries "" be anything but cute , harmless fun ? 

easy . 

take all the cute , harmless fun out of it . 

and while you're at it make it borrr-ring . 

that's what director garry marshall , screenwriter gina wendkos and , not to be outdone , producer whitney houston have done with the g-rated disney film "" the princess diaries . "" 

you couldn't tell it from the audience though , a braintree , mass . of growing , glowing pre-pubescent girls ( and the odd parental , popcorn perched about their persons ) , who positively cheered when the end credits rolled ( ah the film had struck a lovely nerve with them but not with fuddy-duddy old me ) . 

well , i might have cheered that the utter tripe was now well and truly over , but that would have been too obvious . 

too obvious is the least of the problems with marshall's film ( garry made a couple of other "" princess "" movies-- "" pretty woman "" and "" runaway bride "" --but this one's way without julia roberts so maybe * that's * its problem ) . 

in addition to being predictable as molasses , "" the princess diaries "" has hardly got a laugh in it ( it's a comedy ) , could bore the pants off an abyssinian for long , long stretches , and is so sloppily edited the principals refer to scenes we haven't even seen yet ( and probably never will except , perhaps , in the dvd edition ) . 

marshall should take virtually all of the blame here , since he's been at this for some time and should know when a scene or two isn't working . . . 

and hardly * any * of "" the princess diaries "" works ( "" works , "" alas , implies cleverness and there's none of that here either ) . 

newcomer anne hathaway stars as mia thermopolis , a bright but socially invisible san franciscan teen who learns that her single mom ( a wacky artist played by the likable caroline goodall ) had a bit of a fling with some royal member of some miniscule european country nobody ever heard of ( the filmmakers go out of their way * not * to call it serbia , which is pretty much what all miniscule european countries are called in the movies mark my words ) and now she , mia , is next in line to rule "" genovia "" ( hence the headphones/tiara combo in the print ads ) . 

julie andrews , with the luminous factor cranked to 11 , plays mia's grandmother ( aka queen clarisse renaldi ) , who shows up out of the royal blue and lends mia much advice and direction in the eating , talking , and looking like a princess department ( although mia's big makeover simply transforms her from ugly duckling to ugly swan ) . 

does queen julie lose her dignity for the sake of a good laugh ? 

not really . 

consuming a corn dog is about the worst that it gets . 

also on stereotypical hand are a brainless jock , an evil cheerleader , a dorky-looking best friend ( "" welcome to the dollhouse "" 's heather matarazzo ) , a sensitive auto mechanic/musician , and marshall mainstay hector elizondo as joe the driver , imparting wit and wisdom from the front seat of mia's chauffeur-driven limousine at every intersection . 

a non-animated g-rated movie is a rarity these days but the rating here reflects the fact that all the guts , all the good stuff , has been exorcised from the finished product . 

lame , labored , and lamentable , "" the princess diaries "" is recommended for eight-and-a-half year olds of the feminine persuasion * only * ; all others would do well to avoid it ( like potholes , the plague , and "" the perfect storm "" ) .

"this is the best british gangster film since the long good friday . 

jon bennet ( played by andrew howard ) is an extremely good assassin . 

as such he is probably an evil man but it does not worry him . 

he has become an unquestioning weapon . 

he is in the employ of a kingpin ( david calder ) far more evil than he is . 

but even assassins have innocent pasts . 

he runs into an old from school days and he is married to a mutual girl friend from school . 

complicating matters is that they live near where he had a recent job and their young daughter may have seen him at the crime . 

a big piece of what makes this film work is the depiction of the kingpin . 

calder is a familiar actor in britain , though not frequently seen in the us . 

he was seen in the world is not enough . 

here he creates one of the best screen villains in recent years . 

he is at once seductive and repellent like a beautiful venomous snake . 

his lair is underground , apparently in a sewer , where he lives like the king of sewer rats . 

it is the kingpin who pulls the strings that will control bennet's life . 

paul sarossy who directs spent most of his career as a cinematographer and like the kingpin's lair , he has molded images of class and style out of the darkness . 

by using semi-darkness and letting the colors of deep blue and black dominate every scene he makes the film visually as ominous as anything in this nether world . 

this is a world that is cold and unfriendly . 

sorossy creates a world of violence much more by what we hear than what we see . 

this is a film with a great deal of physical violence occurring just out of reach . 

we see very little but we hear a great deal more and we imagine more than that . 

the screenplay is by peter waddington based on the novel by neil cross , but it is sarossy's film all the way . 

it creates indelible images of evil . 

i rate it an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +3 on the -4 to +4 scale . 

 ( i do hope they do not use the tagline "" don't mess with mr . in-between . "" ) 
"
"i'm going to start this review off with a hypothetical question . 

let's say you've just been in a car accident , and the driver of the other vehicle is unconscious . 

your friends have left to go get help , and you're waiting to see if the victim wakes up . 

a tow-truck comes along , and the driver hops out of the truck to see what's going on . 

he then proceeds to kill the unconscious victim by snapping his neck . 

do you : 

a ) run away screaming for your life , staying away from the main road , 

b ) run away ( but not too fast ) and stay on the main road even when the madman in the truck starts following you , * stop * to catch your breath , try to negotiate with the psycho , and when that fails , start running away again , all the while * staying on the main road * ? 

if you answered "" a "" , you are far more intelligent than the screenwriter of "" texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation "" and will likely hate this movie . 

however , if you answered "" b "" , prepare to enjoy a film made with idiots like you in mind ! 

 "" texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation "" is being called a sequel , but it's really more of a remake of the original . 

there's a few changes here and there , but it's essentially the same ( even the infamous "" meathook "" scene has been re-created . ) 

the story opens with four teenagers hitting the road on the night of their prom , and somehow ending up in the middle of nowhere . 

needless to say , they soon encounter leatherface and his nutty family . 

much carnage ensues . 

to call this movie inept would be putting it mildly . 

in addition to the laughably idiotic situation i mentioned in my hypothetical question , there is a moment towards the end of the film where one of the baddies is killed by an airplane that literally comes out of nowhere . 

it just swoops down and kills him with its wheel . 

no explantion is given as to who was flying it or why he/she is going around killing people with the planes wheel . 

the dialogue is even more atrocious . 

zellwegger , who is kidnapped by "" the family "" early on , keeps trying to have normal conversations with these people . 

when you're surrounded by maniacs wielding chainsaws and dead corpses , i would think that rationality would go out the window . 

speaking of going out the window , there is a scene in which zellwegger jumps out a window . 

apparently , the stunt double had a little trouble , because she visibly gets stuck in the window . 

the director quickly cuts to a wide shot where the stunt double * doesn't * get caught in the window . 

this was one of many glaring inconsistencies . 

there are so many , in fact , that if i were to name them all , this review would be several pages long . 

the only reason i am giving this movie one star instead of no stars is because of matthew mcconaughey . 

he plays a member of "" the family "" with a hydraulic leg ( home-made , i might add ) and is so completely over-the-top , you can't help but be amazed by his performance . 

he obviously had a lot of fun with this part , and it really shows . 

he makes jack nicholson's portrayal of the psychotic inn keeper in "" the shining "" look restrained in comparison . 

for a horror movie , "" texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation "" contains surprisingly little gore . 

in fact , in contains none . 

there's a little blood here and there , but that's as far as it goes . 

which leads me to believe that the budget must have been * astonishingly * low , and it shows . 

everything about the movie looks cheap , from the sets to the costumes . 

especially leatherface . 

once frightening and nightmare inducing , he's now as terrifying as dame edna . 

do yourself a favor and take a pass at this remake . 

check out the far superior original instead . 
"
"the yet-to-be-released krippendorf's tribe is being marketed as a family comedy , but buyer beware . 

this movie can't make up its mind . 

is it a family comedy with vulgar references to both the male and female bodies , menstruation , circumcision , and sex that would make any parents squirm at the thought of having their child next to them ? 

or is it an adult comedy approached with such immaturity that only adolescents will appreciate the effort ? 

either way , "" unbalanced "" is the word to stamp on this hit and miss and miss and miss effort . 

the premise is catchy - widowed anthropology professor james krippendorf ( richard dreyfuss ) has spent the past two years "" getting over "" the death of his wife , neglecting key research and squandering grant money on personal living expenses . 

now it's time to show what he's achieved in those two years , and he has absolutely nothing to show for it . 

with a fabricated tale of studying a previously undiscovered tribe in new guinea , krippendorf petitions for new funds while hiding the fact that the previous $100 , 000 grant was spent on trips to mcdonald's . 

but when his "" discovery "" becomes the latest craze among colleagues , the professor finds he must do more than talk about the tribe - he must create it . 

with the aid of his three children , the headstrong teen shelly ( natasha lyonne of everyone says i love you ) , the slightly younger mickey ( gregory smith ) , and the nine-year-old edmund ( carl michael lindner ) , the "" shelmikedmu "" tribe ( named from the first half of each child's name ) is born , and videos quickly produced in krippendorf's backyard are passed off as stunning documentary footage of the newly found new guinea tribe . 

despite the professor's wishes , the buzz surrounding his discovery only grows , due in greatest part to veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , an overly vivacious ( and voluptuous ) anthropologist who barges her way into the discovery and basically deems herself krippendorf's main assistant . 

hungry for recognition , micelli sets up interviews , lectures , etc . in an effort to make this the biggest sociological event in history , a sure fire way to go down in the history books . 

krippendorf , on the other hand , is seeing himself go down a jail cell corridor , not in history books , and with each new lecture , he must come up with something impressive to unleash about the tribe - mating habits , domestic structure , etc . thru fumbling improvisation , and often some quick thinking from his oldest son , krippendorf makes it thru each new lecture , but only creates more and more interest in the highly unique tribe . 

on the opposing end is krippendorf's arch rival , ruth allen ( lily tomlin ) , an arrogant professor whose jealousy drives her on a mission to disprove the existance of the non-existent tribe . 

it's a cute idea , and approached with a more subtle ( and mature ) style , krippendorf's tribe could've been a real winner . 

sadly , the mostly-misfired toilet humor , overly comical musical score ( by bruce broughton ) , and sugar coated sentiments ( all the key ingredients of a "" family comedy "" ) just aren't the right tone for this film . 

cut that crap out , add some razor sharp dialogue and witty sociological perceptions and you've got a good start . 

at the state it's in now , you've got something along the lines of medicine man meets mrs . 

doubtfire meets dumb & dumber , and that's not a concoction anyone should be overly anxious to try . 

the overall product here is a highly forgettable cup of "" average "" , with a few laugh-out-loud moments and a great big gap in between them . 

most of the characters are surprisingly two-dimensional , and the only one who seems to exhibit any real acting effort ( lyonne ) seems to go greatly unappreciated . 

director todd holland has gone about making this film in all the wrong ways . 

it's stuck in limbo between disney family fare ( jungle 2 jungle ) and potentially hilarious adult comedy ( a fish called wanda ) . 

it's this unbalanced structure that really knocks it down a grade , and it's a brutal drop . 

a strong warning to parents : forget the impression given by advertisements , do you want to take your kids to a film that has a woman asking a man if he finds her attractive merely because she's holding his penis ? 

yes , it's put that bluntly ! 

just be warned - this is merely one example of the many shocking subjects to be brought up in the film , and others might not be as tame .

"if snake eyes were a dog , you'd put it to sleep . 

if it was a couch , you'd put it out on the sidewalk , where it would sit for a week . 

if it were your child , you'd be reading military school catalogs . 

if it were a ship -- no , it wouldn't be the titanic , that would imply glamor and tragedy -- it would be the exxon valdez . 

 ( personal side note : i saw this movie on the road during a houston business trip . 

for whatever reason , my hotel's cable system wasn't showing the astros-braves game , which featured a randy johnson-greg maddux matchup . 

this forced me to pay full price for snake eyes instead of watching a perfectly good baseball game for free -- so the invective , deserved as it is , should be seen in that perspective . ) 

snake eyes is supposed to be a mystery movie , and good mystery movies are supposed to leave you asking yourself questions on the way out of theater . 

snake eyes is not a good mystery movie , but i had some questions : where's the manager , and how do i get a re-admit pass ? 

if i fall asleep on the drive home and wreck my rent-a-car , can i sue brian de palma ? 

is it too late for the academy to revoke nicolas cage's oscar ? 

will someone please ( i'm begging you ) give gary sinise a role worthy of his talents ? 

and how , exactly does cage end up wearing the exact same shirt and tie as sinise does ? 

the first and most glaringly wrong thing with snake eyes is the trailer . 

if you've seen the trailer without seeing the movie , consider yourself fortunate . 

the trailer is a work of sheer genius . 

it manages to convey everything worthy of the movie -- the noteworthy steadicam work , the exuberance of cage's performance as a thoroughly corrupt atlantic city policeman , the essential elements of the marginal plot . 

the expert craftsman who pieced together a fairly good trailer out of snippets of a wretched movie deserves praise and a percentage of the gross . 

 ( is a best trailer category at the oscars that far-fetched , after all ? ) 

but all it does is set us up for an overwhelmingly disappointing movie . 

the trailer sets up what should have been a promising plot : detective ricky santoro ( cage ) must solve the mystery of who shot the secretary of defense at an atlantic city pay-per-view boxing match . 

unfortunately , there are multiple problems afoot . 

the trailer gives away much , too much of the story . 

the shooter is killed instantly , so the story revolves around why the secretary was killed and who is involved in the conspiracy . 

the film's secret is ho-hum at best , and anyone who has watched the trailer and is aware of the law of economy of characters can figure out who the top conspirator is . 

without an interesting plot , without interesting dialogue , and without much of a reason to care about the characters or the story , snake eyes is a failure on almost every possible level . 

as much as i hated this movie , i must give brian de palma one tiny bit of credit . 

de palma is maddeningly inconsistent . 

he can , on his day , create amazingly well-done movies ( the untouchables , carlito's way ) . 

on off-days , he can be , well , just horrid ( the bonfire of the vanities , raising cain ) . 

snake eyes falls into the horrid category , but there are a couple of moments that are worth seeing strictly for their film-school degree-of-difficulty value . 

the steadicam opening scene does a good job of introducing the cage character and is a virtuoso technical job by both the director and the actor . 

there is a split-screen chase scene that looks pretty good , and it's followed by a god's eye view of a bank of hotel rooms that's imaginitively done . 

this is what's called giving the devil his due . 

but the technical skill doesn't even come close to making up for the sheer evil of this movie . 

placing plot holes to one side for a moment , snake eyes features easily the worst boxing match in cinema history ( george foreman is in better shape than the movie boxers ) , a hurricane that exists for no other reason than to punctuate significant plotlines with portentuous thunderclaps , and perhaps the worst , most overly drawn out ending in years . 

snake eyes is a criminal act , an evil waste of time and talent . 

cage , sinise , and yes , even de palma deserve better . 

the audience deserves better -- but no refund , no re-admit pass , no free popcorn coupon , can ever restore to us the time we've spent or wash the awful images from our mind . 

however , we are left with one consolation , that we were warned by the movie's title -- because snake eyes is nothing more than a roll of craps .

"disillusioned and trying to find the spice of life , richard ( leonardo dicaprio ) sets off for thailand . 

there he a meets crazed man by the name of daffy ( robert carlyle ) who gives him a map to a beach , a secret utopia , then commits suicide . 

richard sets off for this beach with his neighbors from this hotel , ? tienne ( guillaume canet ) and fran ? oise ( virginie ledoyen ) . 

once they get there the three discover a secret society existing on this beach , there richard falls for fran ? oise . 

this covers about half to two thirds of the movie and aside from the romantic element , which is solely a creation of hollywood , seems to hold to the original novel . 

the cinematography and general beauty of this part of the movie is breathtaking . 

i don't think anyone can argue that this movie is visually stunning . 

but that is were many things go wrong , darius khondji has totally outdone himself in doing the cinematography . 

though the script and the interpretation of the novel are quite lacking . 

the plot of the movie moves along at a decent pace for about half of the movie or there abouts . 

this is where the movie has some great potential , then the three travelers get the island and there is a turn for the better , yes folks i said better . 

now up to about two thirds of this movie its actually pretty good , nothing spectacular aside from the cinematography but it still has promise . 

this is where things start to degenerate to something that becomes almost un-watchable . 

there is even a 'video game' style sequence that borders on the disgusting , it doesn't make sense for the movie and just looks dumb in my opinion ( and i am hoping many other peoples ) . 

i am hoping that in my little rant i've made it abundantly clear that the movie is lacking quite seriously in plot and uneven pacing , so if you go see it and you don't like it because of this don't blame me . 

the character development was not up to par either ; i found the character of richard to be nothing more than a spoiled child . 

although there is a feeble attempt to make this whole story profound it fails and richard ( leo's character ) comes off as a wannabe philosopher . 

the character seems to be underdeveloped from the get go and seems to just do things for no apparent reason , granted some people are like this ( myself included ) but i nor anyone i know that is fairly random would ever do things of the sort this character does . 

the next point is that some of the really interesting characters are simply not developed enough . 

richard is obviously obsessed by fran ? oise at the early stages of the story , yet there is actually very little development along this story line . 

this i am sure contributes to the movie's lack of core plot and being unfocused . 

now , i shall move onto something a little better about the movie ( for all you cynics out there the movie did have a few good things about it ) . 

the cast and acting was passable at the very least , and i think that leonardo dicaprio actually did pretty well in the role of richard . 

mind you i think the rest of the cast that had some which had reasonably sized roles did equally well if not better . 

which begs the question why is leonardo paid so much ? 

 ( i think this is a topic all on its own so i won't get into it ) . 

but i like the fact that there was an international cast used , had only and american cast been used i can see this movie being horrible . 

the international flavor added a more global feel to the movie that made it that much more bearable . 

not to mention the movie is set in thailand and a global cast makes more sense . 

when all is said and done i liked the movie for the most part but the gaping inadequacies of the plot are unforgivable . 

i would not recommend this movie to anyone , the fact that i liked it has a lot to do with the cinematography and the sheer beauty of the movie not its plot or story . 

as it is the story tries to be much too philosophical and fails at its attempt . 

if you do end up going to see this movie be forewarned about its shortcomings .

"set in harlem during the great depression , rival gangster "" families "" go to war over control of "" the numbers "" , an illegal gambling lottery . 

 "" runners "" take bets from potential lottery winners and deliver them to private locations for drawings . 

the undisputed leader of the harlem numbers is the madame queen ( cicely tyson ) who is challenged by dutch schulz ( tim roth ) , a ruthless hoodlum . 

by turning against the queen , dutch defies his partner , the infamous lucky luciano ( andy garcia ) , who wishes to respect the queen and keep the peace . 

the queens' army strengthens when an acquaintance , ellsworth "" bumpy "" johnson ( lawrence fishburne ) is released from prison and becomes a bodyguard for her . 

he proves himself worthy in short time as he thwarts an assassination attempt ( on himself and the queen ) , and later takes control of the queens army when she is jailed for tax evasion . 

bumpy's reign is not as restrained and subdued as the queen and he declares all out war on dutch . 

bloody gang warfare ensues . 

bumpy faces many obstacles during his reign . 

his new army questions his methods . 

his girlfriend ( vanessa l . williams ) and the queen disagree with his violent solutions . 

most importantly ( in his eyes ) , dutch has become a more formidable foe than he imagined , and seeks help from lucky luciano to assassinate him . 

there have been so many movies dealing with organized crime that it must be hard to write an original story dealing with it . 

this movie is not original at all . 

in fact , i was angered by how many similarities there was between this film and , arguably , the best gangster movie of all time , the godfather . 

if you are going to borrow ideas from another movie and not give credit , why not borrow from a lesser known movie ( say , millers crossing ? ) . 

how could the credited screenwriter chris brancato not give credit to mario puzo himself ? 

here are just some of the major similarities ( i stopped counting at 10 ) . 

crooked cop assaults blood relative of the leader . 

gang extracts revenge on crooked cop . 

wife ( or girlfriend ) questions her partners' murderous activities and leaves him . 

high ranking "" officer "" betrays the leader . 

blood relative of the leader murdered . 

war erupting between the "" families "" . 

high-ranking officer disapproves of the leader in front of other family members . 

new leader runs family differently from previous leader . 

large meeting with all families involved . 

the setup in this movie is done rather well . 

i enjoyed the portrayal of the network of "" runners "" sprinting through the streets collecting bets for the queens lottery . 

this was the way of life in harlem , and most people involved with the queen did so because it was the only way to support their families and put food on the table . 

number running was the only way for the harlem population to find work . 

i also enjoyed the interaction between the angry , violent dutch and the calm , patient lucky . 

after about the 30-40 minute mark all of the similarities with the godfather start appearing , one after the other ( and in short order ) . 

it was a huge distraction , and an insult to my intelligence . 

who was the screenwriter kidding here ? 

some of the individual performances were well done . 

andy garcia was very convincing as lucky , unfortunately his screen time is reduced to a supporting role . 

tim roth effectively plays the cocky villain , much like his roles in "" the cook , the thief , his wife and her lover "" and "" rob roy "" . 

the good performances and convincing setup during the first third of the movie do not make up for the lackluster story that follows . 

a couple of coincidences is one thing , over a dozen is an insult .

" "" party camp , "" is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies i've seen in awhile . 

a late rip-off of the "" meatballs "" series , the film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk . 

that's really about all that can be said about the "" plot "" because nothing much happens , except that the main character , wise-cracking jerry ( andrew ross ) , has the hots for a cute blonde ( kerry brennan ) , and there is a big contest in the climax . 

how fun ! 

since , "" party camp , "" has practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved , the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative . 

it's not that i think exploitation is necessarily a good quality , but when you are talking about a dull turkey like this , the least that could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of mindless sex . 

even a psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick . 

at least , then , it wouldn't have been such a chore to sit through . 

never before have i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat . 

the comedy was easy to spot , but it wasn't the least bit funny . 

it was groan-inducing . 

constantly throghout , i was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything . 

so what saves , "" party camp , "" from the dreaded zero star rating ? 

well , that's simple : jewel shepard , as a flighty bimbo , was admittedly fun to watch . 

although nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash , at least if the film had centered on shepard , she might have been able to add a little spice to an otherwise rancid , low-budget teen comedy .

"depending on your degree of cinematic acumen , last man standing is either a ) a prohibition-era remake of akira kurosawa's 1961 classic yojimbo ; b ) a prohibition-era remake of sergio leone's 1964 classic a fistful of dollars ; c ) a prohibition-era action drama with a completely original story-line . 

new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category ( c ) than in the other two combined , much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons . 

the fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing , which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the _real_ source material , the dashiell hammett novel _red harvest_ . 

it also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself . 

this time around , the man with no name is played by bruce willis , a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico . 

by all appearances , jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town , with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border . 

one is headed by an irishman named doyle ( david patrick kelly ) ; the other is run by chicago-connected italian mobster strozzi ( ned eisenberg ) . 

calling himself john smith , the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict , and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyle's side . 

but smith's allegiance is as uncertain as his name , and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them . 

viewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint , and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes-cum-bastardizations . 

there is the happily ineffectual lawman ( bruce dern ) , the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses' affections ( karina lombard ) , the barkeep who becomes our anti-hero's only friend ( william sanderson ) , suspicious lieutenants ( christopher walken and michael imperioli ) to question the bosses' trust in smith , a brutal beating , and a big fire . 

director walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids , including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity , but at least he doesn't try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture . 

what he _does_ do is nearly as big a mistake , and that is to provide a running voice-over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard-boiled style of pulp detective fiction . 

yes , that narration is full of cliches , but those are are not particularly troubling . 

the problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters . 

they were a mystery , to the other characters in the film and to the audience , their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted , and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status . 

with john smith's voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought , he becomes more mundane , just another tough guy trying to stay alive . 

it feels like a hammett novel , all right , and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice , but it simply doesn't work . 

the narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence , and the man with no name takes _no one_ into his confidence . 

even if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate , i can't imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction . 

willis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith , but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else . 

christopher walken plays doyle's brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft-spoken psychos , and there isn't another single character whom makes even the slightest impression . 

with no compelling antagonist for smith , there is no build-up towards the expected showdown , and when it does come , that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about . 

cinematographer lloyd ahern ( who also did the only noteworthy work on hill's 1995 flop wild bill ) creates some nifty sunburned vistas , but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter-productive narration . 

sometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original , they'll wonder what all the talk was about . 

in the case of last man standing , it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about .

"as the film opens up , expectant unwed mother sally ( played by drew barrymore ) encounters her baby's father in a fast food drive-through window . 

after he gets his milkshake , he drives off , only to be pursued by a military helicopter . 

from this moment forward , you know that this isn't going to be your run-of-the-mill romantic comedy . 

home fries tells the tale of the relationship between sally and dorian ( played by luke wilson ) , a helicopter pilot who has a different kind of connection with sally . . . more 

than he would care to admit ( hint : it has something to do with the father of sally's unborn child ) . 

after taking a personal ( and professional ) interest in her , he finds work at the local fast food restaurant at which she works , and the fun goes on from there . 

this movie is a lot of fun . 

it is comedic on two levels , as a romantic comedy and a dark comedy . 

the romantic moments are sweet , yet not sappy . 

one of the more poignant moments is when dorian accompanies sally to lamaze classes . 

however , the dark comedic moments are more memorable . 

this is also a tale of revenge , and a funny one at that . 

the father of sally's unborn child also happened to be a married man , whose wife is played by catherine o'hara . 

she does a wonderful portrayal of a jealous wife who is targeting the person who had an affair , and is not above getting other people to do her dirty work . 

 ( my apologies if this sounds cryptic , but there is too much of the plot to give away ) . 

rounding out the cast are jake busey as angus , dorian's overzealous brother and daryl mitchell as roy , dorian's trainer at the fast food restaurant . 

the dialogue is sharp and not filled with sappy overtones , even with the romantic nature of the plot . 

if there are any complaints , it is over drew barrymore's performance . 

while she does light up the screen , there are moments when she doesn't seem all that convincing . 

the movie was filmed in texas , and most of the characters have southern texan accents . 

drew barrymore's accent tends to come and go ( luke wilson doesn't seem to have this problem ) . 

as well , she seems awfully agile for a woman that is eight months pregnant . 

still , this movie is one that will please many viewers . 

with plot twists galore and hilarious dark moments , this is sure to entertain .

"scarface , a remake of the 1932 film of the same name , is a very gripping and , as far as i know , a true-to-life story of how power and violence lead to corruption . 

al pacino , as tony montana ( for whom the movie is named ) , also provides a brilliant performance as a cuban refugee who comes to america with less than nothing and becomes one of the most highly respected and feared drug lords in miami . 

oliver stone also penned the screenplay in one of his earlier writing roles . 

the film begins by disclosing the story of now fidel castro ordered thousands of cubans to set sail and head for the coasts of the united states . 

many of these cubans had criminal records , such as tony montana , a cocky , fast-talking man who has the look of crime . 

nearly right after his arrival in miami , tony is thrust into the gangster life when he participates in a cocaine buy that goes awry . 

along with his friend and partner , manolo ( steven bauer ) , tony rises in the gangster ranks when he forms a friendship with frank lopez ( robert loggia ) , a high-roller in the organized crime field . 

tony also begins to fall in love with elvira ( michelle pfeiffer ) , who at the time was frank's lover . 

of course , sooner or later in this industry , betrayal and corruption amount into a force greater than anything else , and tony is one of the ones who fall victim to this force . 

this is not before he becomes one of the most respected , and often feared , men in miami . 

tony gets to the point where he cannot trust anyone , and everyone he knows basically feels the same way towards him . 

no one can trust him , and basically , no one does . 

scarface , although incredibly violent , is one of the best crime films of its time and stands out as another great performance for al pacino . 

although he did not receive any recognition from the academy for his performance , it truly is a very good one . 

in fact , his accent and facial movements alone are enough in my mind to win at least a nomination ( although he did get a golden globe nomination ) . 

another element that stands out when someone mentions this film is the profanity . 

a figure tagged to the film boasts that the word "" fuck "" and it's uses are uttered 206 times throughout the film , which is apparently a record . 

the thing is , the vulgarity fits rather well with the movie . 

as odd as it sounds , it's true . 

in the end , scarface is a very powerful film that hits home hard . 
"
" "" practical magic , "" is a film that is so misguided in so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented and high-profile actors would even get involved in an embarrassing clap-trap like this one . 

the film stars sandra bullock and nicole kidman as sally and gillian owens , two sisters whose family comes from a long line of witches , spanning back 200 years . 

at the start , their parents die when they are still children , and they go to live with their two zany aunts ( stockard channing and dianne wiest ) . 

switch to the present day , gillian , who is the stronger , more rebellious sibling , leaves home , and meets up with a dark , abusive guy ( goran visjnic ) , while sally stays in their hometown , meets and falls in love with a sweet , caring man , has two children , and then is devastated when her husband is hit by a truck and killed ( come to think of it , she's not too devastated since she gets over it in about two minutes ) . 

when gillian calls sally to come get her after having another abusive spat with visjnic , they accidentally murder him , and in desperation , bury the body in the backyard of their aunts' house . 

add to this wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising and an exorcism , not to mention a spattering of "" light-hearted whimsy , "" and you have a pretty good idea how messy "" practical magic "" is . 

after seeing the film , i reflected that there was not even one scene , or element , that i liked or enjoyed . 

it is a comedy , to be sure , but all of the humor falls astoundingly flat , and the occasional dramatic moments are the least bit touching . 

it is not charming or entertaining in any way . 

and then to top it off , we've got this dark , but bird-brained story of an evil spirit taking over gillian's body . 

whatever . 

the characters are handled terribly , and actually , most of the actors do not have the fortune of even getting to be what you could call a character . 

there is no reason why channing and wiest should have decided to be in this film , and in every scene involving them , they are always standing side-by-side . 

no attempt is made to flesh them out into actual people . 

the same goes for aidan quinn , as a handsome police investigator , who has the misfortune of being the romantic lead opposite bullock , even though he comes into it at around the 70-minute mark , and once again , there is no attempt to develop their relationship , or his character , in any way . 

in fact , every line of dialogue in the film is in service of moving the plot along , rather than getting to know the people saying the lines . 

i should have know i was headed for trouble during the opening credits , when i found out the screenplay was written by the deeply hated akiva goldsman , who managed to destroy the "" batman "" series with "" batman forever "" and "" batman and robin . "" 

 "" practical magic "" is directed by griffin dunne , primarily an actor , who last year made the contrived , clumsy romance , "" addicted to love , "" with meg ryan and matthew broderick . 

i disliked that movie quite a bit , but since "" practical magic "" is even worse , that can only give you a taste of what a talentless filmmaker he is . 

i'd tell him to quit while he's ahead , but in these last two years , he's ultimately already buried himself .

"synopsis : big-breasted and dim-witted sculptress britt gets really mad at her grad student boyfriend because he spends too much time on his thought-transference experiments instead of her art showings . 

elderly , evil scientist everett longstreet switches minds with britt's boy , in the meantime , and goes completely mental . 

comments : naked souls opens with a naked woman , and the movie makes no illusion that it's a sci-fi vehicle designed to show pamela anderson's , um , talents . 

if you are really interested in seeing anderson's talents , however , i suggest you skip over this dud and watch the infamous pam and tommy lee honeymoon sex tape , now available on home video . 

at least with that "" movie , "" you don't have to go through the painful experience of watching pamela try to pronounce multiple syllable words like "" eclectic . "" 

a premise does exist in the movie . 

basically , while anderson wears skimpy clothes which barely contain her talents , she practices her art -- brilliantly slapping plaster of paris on naked women . 

her boyfriend , meanwhile , spends 20 hours a day in a morgue trying to view the memories of dead prison inmates because this will "" make a difference to humanity . "" 

whatever . 

the movie fails to explain how these two hooked up . 

be grateful . 

after we meet the evil everett longstreet , lots of technobabble and mystical mumbo-jumbo get tossed about , pammy has sex replete with cheesy make-out music , and minds get transferred . 

never fear , though , pammy uses her sharp mental abilities ( ahem ) to save her boyfriend in the end . 

unfortunately , no one saves the movie . 

avoid this would-be sci-fi thriller , unless you're in for a good laugh or two .

"there may not be a critic alive who harbors as much affection for shlock monster movies as i do . 

i delighted in the sneaky-smart entertainment of ron underwood's big-underground-worm yarn tremors ; i even giggled at last year's critically-savaged big-underwater-snake yarn anaconda . 

something about these films causes me to lower my inhibitions and return to the saturday afternoons of my youth , spent in the company of ghidrah , the creature from the black lagoon and the blob . 

deep rising , a big-undersea-serpent yarn , doesn't quite pass the test . 

sure enough , all the modern monster movie ingredients are in place : a conspicuously multi-ethnic/multi-national collection of bait . . . excuse 

me , characters ; an isolated location , here a derelict cruise ship in the south china sea ; some comic relief ; a few cgi-enhanced gross-outs ; and at least one big explosion . 

there are too-cheesy-to-be-accidental elements , like a sleazy shipping magnate ( anthony heald ) who also appears to have a doctorate in marine biology , or a slinky international jewel thief ( famke janssen ) whose white cotton tank top hides a heart of gold . 

as it happens , deep rising is noteworthy primarily for the mechanical manner in which it spits out all those ingredients . 

a terrorist crew , led by squinty-eyed mercenary hanover ( wes studi ) and piloted by squinty-eyed boat captain finnegan ( treat williams ) , shows up to loot the cruise ship ; the sea monsters show up to eat the mercenary crew ; a few survivors make it to the closing credits . 

and up go the lights . 

it's hard to work up much enthusiasm for this sort of joyless film-making , especially when a monster moview should make you laugh every time it makes you scream . 

here , the laughs are provided almost entirely by kevin j . o'connor , generally amusing as the crew's fraidy-cat mechanic . 

writer/director stephen sommers seems most concerned with creating a tone of action-horror menace -- something over-populated with gore-drenched skeletons , something where the gunfire and special effects are taken a bit too seriously . 

deep rising is missing that one unmistakable cue that we're expected to have a ridiculous good time , not hide our eyes . 

case it point , comparing deep rising to its recent cousin anaconda . 

in deep rising , one of the creature's victims is regurgitated back into view , partially digested and still alive . 

he shrieks in horror at his freakish appearance and pain , in a moment a bit too disturbing to be laughable . 

in anaconda , we also see a regurgitated victim , partially digested and still alive . 

he looks at another character . . . and 

winks . 

make no mistake , deep rising has anaconda beat all to heck when it comes to technical proficiency and pacing . 

it's also gloomy , uninspired and not nearly enough fun . 

i don't ask much of my monster movies , but i do ask that they act like monster movies . 

you don't have to show me a fantastically impressive , massive beast with tentacles a-flailing . 

just show me the massive beast burping , and i'll figure you get the point .

"mary norton's children's book series , the borrowers , has been made into several below-average television movies . 

so , i wasn't too enthused as i entered the theater for the big-screen debut of the minute clan . 

but i was in for a shock , the borrowers is actually a thoroughly delightful movie with plenty of good laughs and even some decent special effects . 

the lender family is being thrown out of their longtime home . 

their aunt , who owned the property , never left a will . 

now , an unscrupulous lawyer , ocious potter ( john goodman ) plans to demolish the house and replace it with an ultra-modern housing development . 

but the lenders are not alone in their house . 

living under the floorboards is a family of borrowers , 4 inch tall people who make their living as scavengers from the human "" beans "" above . 

the clock family of borrowers is as distressed as the lenders , especially once they discover the evil potter actually has a copy of the will which leaves the home to the lenders . 

so it is up to the clocks ( pod ( jim broadbent ) and homily ( celia imrie ) , along with their kids , arrietty ( flora newbigin ) and peagreen ( tom felton ) ) to recover the will and save the household . 

but when potter learns of the tiny people , he enlists the skills of exterminator jeff ( mark williams ) to kill off the clan . 

there's plenty of attention to detail in the borrowers , especially in the furnishings of the clock family house , made out of lost board game parts and credit cards . 

the background details are nearly as rich as the entertaining story . 

the various predicaments of the clock family are clever and thrilling . 

based on an original story , the screenwriters did a good job at imagining all the potential and unusual perils that could exist for a 4-inch tall person . 

as the villain , john goodman's performance veers on the edge of being over-the-top . 

but his performance suits the role well , and he does very well in the film's many slapstick moments . 

with a nearly seamless mix of oversized sets , bluescreen shots and cgi , the special effects in the borrowers are very well done . 

there are a few times when you can spot the effects at work , but none of them are so jarring that you lose the suspension of disbelief . 

hopefully the borrowers will surpass the curse of being labeled a children-only movie , for it is surprisingly entertaining and fun to watch . 
"
" "" deep rising "" gives you that sinking feeling both literally and figuratively : not only does the movie take place on a cruise ship slowly being immersed into the middle of the ocean by a squid-like menace , but the unfolding story is artificial , silly and almost completely derivative of countless other ( and , for the most part , better ) films . 

while dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures -- take , for example , the schlocky mountain highs of last spring's "" anaconda "" -- "" deep rising "" has no tongue to put in its cheek . 

folks , we're only a month into the new year , and already here's a candidate for one of its stinkiest releases . 

most of the action takes place on the argonautica , a luxury liner in the middle of its maiden voyage ( uh-oh -- if these people had seen "" titanic , "" then maybe they'd have known to stay home ) when it's attacked by a giant , tentacled sea creature . 

the only survivors are slinky jewel thief trilian ( famke janssen ) , argonautica owner canton ( anthony heald ) and a few other crew members . 

a mercenary team , lead by resourceful captain john finnegan ( treat williams ) , board the argonautica looking for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby . 

but what their search of the ship uncovers is something blood-soaked , hungry and not very helpful . 

the main problem with "" deep rising "" is its overt familiarity ; the movie makes absolutely no attempt to differentiate itself from most sci-fi/horror films in recent memory . 

the concept is "" leviathan "" meets "" titanic , "" with a dash of "" speed 2 "" thrown in for good ( or is that bad ? ) 

measure . 

this monster is equal parts "" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea "" and "" the relic , "" knows how to open doors like the raptors from "" jurassic park "" and even gets to expel a half-digested victim ( a neat effect , admittedly ) a la the giant snake in "" anaconda . "" 

some of the attack sequences are straight out of "" jaws "" and "" alien . "" 

a scene where the remaining survivors have to travel under water to escape death is right out of "" alien resurrection . "" 

there's even a jet ski chase like "" hard rain . "" 

and the list goes on . 

watching "" deep rising "" 's cast battle the beast is a murky chore in itself , because none of them have well-developed characters , nor do they seem to project even the slightest sense of fear when facing their enemy . 

williams is affable enough , but his finnegan just isn't believable . 

an interesting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted ; pretty famke janssen , best known as "" goldeneye "" 's killer thighs , is trapped in a forced romantic interest with williams , while kevin j . o'connor , as finnegan's mechanic , provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick that gets old fast . 

djimon honsou , who received raves for his performance as a noble slave in december's "" amistad , "" pops up in a brief part . 

he needs to stay away from the water . 

the movie's final shot is a groaner , as is the 11th-hour regurgitation of a subplot involving an on-ship saboteur . 

as if a cast deserving of their snack food-fate isn't bad enough ( when you taunt the monster , you're really asking for it ) , "" deep rising "" is a slow , stupid slog through a story without a single bright spot . 

and since we all know that the higher the casualty rate is , the closer we are to the end of the movie , rooting for this overgrown squid to swallow the whole ship isn't out of the question .

"bad movies described as "" a swift descent into sinful pleasure , decay , and debauchery "" are hard to watch . 

bad 2000's movies that resemble bad 1980s films are even harder to watch . 

shadow hours falls into the latter category , a mish-mashed train wreck of b-movie actors ( including michael dorn , aka star trek's worf ) , an uninteresting plot , vain attempts at capitalizing on the "" underground "" scenes of seedy los angeles , and really , really bad directing and horrendous music video-esque ballistic editing that was taught to me in film school right before i decided to drop out . 

the film revolves around the life of michael holloway ( balthazar getty ) who is trying to restart his life with his one-dimensional wife chloe ( rebecca gayheart ) after a nasty bout of drug and alcohol addictions . 

michael takes a job of working the graveyard shift at the local gas station and is bombarded by the ugliness and weirdness of the nightlife of l . a . one night , he meets a strange gent named stuart ( mr . buckaroo banzai , peter weller ) . 

he drives a porsche , smokes french cigarettes , and drones on about life , eventually coaxing mike into exploring the "" underbelly "" of l . a . together , a tour of punk bars , s&m clubs , and bare-knuckle fights . 

the film then throws in a murder mystery with a cop played peter greene , acting like he wants to get the chance at a reprisal of his role in the mask 2 . the film then simply dissolves into a cheap rip-off of dante's inferno mixed with an old stephen j . cannell television pilot . 

the pace of the film is jarring and utterly without focus . 

other horrors include the endless montages of people pumping gas and the charlie sheen , johnny depp , richard grieco-esque acting of balthazar getty . 

peter weller clearly knows his career is completely gone and doesn't give two shits about it . 

and after the cheap exploitation of bondage clubs , dance clubs , and brothels - damn , isn't anyone safe any more from the ugly eye of hollywood ! ? 

way back in 1984 , a great but crazy director named abel ferrara made his worse film and called it fear city . 

shadow hours reminds me of an almost perfect sequel .

"ex-universal soldier luc has to battle a group of newer-model engineered fighters gone bad . 

the review 

jean-claude van damme has a one-liner early on in universal soldier : the return , his latest attempt to remain relevant , that sums up this entire movie ; he says "" been there , done that . "" 

no film critic could possibly sum up van damme's recent film choices any better . 

while other ageing action stars have wisely moved into other film genres ( schwarzenegger makes as many family comedies as he does action films ) , van damme stubbornly persists in sticking with what used to work for him : martial arts and guns . 

this unwillingness or perhaps inability to move into new genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world , with legionnaire never seeing the inside of a multiplex . 

he joins fellow martial artist/action star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away . 

universal soldier : the return is truly poor . 

the plot is a complete copy of several action films from this decade , specifically terminator 2 : judgement day and the similarly named soldier . 

soldier's kurt russell was an older model super-soldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors , for the good of a planet ; schwarzenegger's terminator in t2 tried to save john connor from a newer model killing machine , the t-1000 ; and jean-claude , a former universal soldier , has to save the planet from the rampage of a group of , you guessed it , newer model soldiers . 

considering the poor box office performance of soldier , it's amazing that this project was ever given the go-ahead . 

luc devereaux ( van damme ) was the sole remaining universal soldier ( or unisol for short ) , until he was returned to a normal , if muscular , human form . 

in this sequel ( technically the fourth film in the series , following two straight-to-video duds that were ignored here plot-wise ) , luc is now a human trainer/consultant of sorts for the unisol program . 

working with dylan cotner ( xander berkeley , who interestingly also appeared in t2 ) , the unisol program has engineered a tougher , fiercer fighting force with the help of super-computer seth . 

unfortunately , upon hearing that the program has been axed by the government , seth takes control of his soldiers , killing everyone in the building except for luc , his partner maggie , his daughter hillary and erin , a reporter trapped inside . 

the rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive , while beating up a group of near-indestructible soldiers , most notably romeo ( popular wrestler goldberg ) . 

there are lots of fights , gun battles , lame plot developments and a noticeable lack of plausibility . 

there are so many clich ? s in this film that it is almost painful to watch . 

luc gets saddled with the task of saving erin the reporter early on , and in the course of a single night , they go from bickering to falling for each other , to kissing . 

erin is a pathetically-written character ; people are getting brutally gunned down all around her , and yet , not only does this not seem to frighten her , but she finds time to remind luc that she "" isn't leaving without her story "" . 

whatever . 

other laughable moments include a ) luc going to a strip club to get internet access ( what ? ) and b ) a group of rangers , who after having been given good advice ( luc tells them that their weapons are useless , and shows them a specific gun which should work better ) , choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway ( guess who wins the battle ? ) . 

not one single scene in universal soldier : the return has any originality to it . 

when fuelled by don davis' loud , driving music score , the film's many fights become almost passable , but mostly are full of the same ol' jean-claude moves . 

director mic rodgers ( a former stunt co-ordinator ) keeps the action coming at a rapid pace , with only a few token serious moments to be found . 

his past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows , tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion . 

if only jean-claude weren't getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li , rodgers could probably have made a decent action film . 

to place the blame squarely at van damme's feet , however , is an injustice . 

i'm not sure that anyone , not even robert deniro or edward norton , could make writers william malone and john fasano's script sound good . 

one particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access . 

he cringes , looks down and mutters "" uh . . . uhm . . . 

they all do , i saw it on 60 minutes . 

eh he he he "" the script's and indeed the entire film's only saving grace is goldberg . 

he chews up every scene he is in , obviously enjoying his role immensely . 

he even gives the film a few laughs , as he mutters things like "" i really don't like that guy "" every time he fails to kill luc . 

sadly , his presence is not enough to turn universal soldier : the return into anything better than a below-average action film that truly deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straight-to-video . 
"
"after 1993's "" falling down , "" i hoped that joel schumacher would mature into a great director . 

since then he has offered us two so-so adaptations of john grisham novels ( "" the client "" and "" a time to kill "" ) and two batman movies that lowered the standards of that franchise . 

although these disappointments dampened my enthusiasm for schumacher's potential , the publicity for his latest release , "" 8mm , "" raised new hope . 

it promised to be something unusual . 

it wasn't . 

the plot goes like this : tom welles ( nicolas cage ) is a private eye who is hired by a wealthy woman , allegorically named mrs . christian ( myra carter ) , to investigate an 8mm movie found among her late husband's belongings . 

the movie appears to be a snuff film in which a teenage girl is raped and murdered by a man in a leather mask ( who reminds me of bane in schumacher's "" batman & robin "" ) . 

because murders can be realistically simulated in movies , mrs . christian wants tom to discover if the girl is alive or dead . 

by combing through missing persons reports , tom finds the girl's name and tracks her to los angeles . 

with the aid of max california ( joaquin phoenix ) , a video store clerk ( and another symbolic name ) , tom wanders through the underworld of pornography in search of snuff . 

the plot bears an obvious resemblance to paul schrader's "" hardcore , "" in which a father goes deeper and deeper into the industries of porn and sex to find his missing daughter . 

both films are modeled on dante's "" the inferno , "" of course ; "" 8mm "" makes that connection overly obvious by casting max as virgil and having him constantly tell tom that they were heading toward a meeting with the devil . 

 "" hardcore "" is a much more subtle and meaningful film . 

 "" 8mm "" had a lot of promise . 

in its better moments it's an examination of violence as entertainment and of the beast within even a nice guy like tom . 

one moment of the first sort : when we first meet max he's reading truman capote's "" in cold blood "" underneath the cover of a porn novel . 

 "" in cold blood "" was the father of the true-crime genre , which is the literary equivalent of snuff films . 

max promises that we will see examples of the second theme when he tells tom , "" dance with the devil and the devil don't change ; the devil changes you . "" 

tom does change-i'll let you discover the specifics for yourself-but not permanently . 

schumacher and screenwriter andrew kevin walker didn't have the guts to take tom so far down the dark tunnel that he couldn't come back . 

 ( walker's "" seven "" did a much better job on that theme by refusing to compromise ) . 

cage tries hard to pull it off , but the script doesn't give him enough to work with . 

phoenix walks away with the movie-he's smart , charming , and funny . 

other cast members include "" fargo "" 's peter stormare camping it up as porn auteur dino velvet and "" the sopranos "" 's james gandolfini as a soulless porn merchant who pushes tom too far . 

in the last analysis , since "" 8mm "" falls short of its pretensions and its promise , its just another private eye story in the raymond chandler/ross macdonald tradition of having the detective uncover the depravity behind the glossy facade of wealth and privilege . 

however , unlike other predictable fare in the genre-last year's "" twilight , "" for example- "" 8mm "" is especially disappointing because it could have been much more than it is .

"the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook example of the difference between television movies and "" real "" movies . 

consider for a moment what a television producer would do with a book that features a fatal school bus accident and a lawyer out to sign up the bereaved -- lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer and toothpaste . 

top-flight writer and director atom egoyan delivers instead a film with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety . 

based on a respected book of the same name by author russell banks , the movie represents a rethinking of the story's structure , not merely a literal adaptation of the novel . 

told in linear form by four narrators in the book , egoyan's version happens instead in overlapping time sequences and without a narrator . 

the author is even on record as applauding egoyan's changes . 

in the press notes the book's author describes the story as "" a parable of lost children . "" 

he says it asks what a town does in the absence of its children . 

picking up on this , egoyan has a flashback in which a sitter , nicole burnell , played with grace by sarah polley , reads parts of "" the pied piper "" from an old , illustrated book to her two charges . 

periodically throughout the picture , nicole's readings are heard in voice-over . 

you have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment . 

they and the rest of the town's children come into harm's way -- some live and others are seriously injured . 

and the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs is never the same again . 

although the physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children , the adults bear the emotional scars of the loss . 

ian holm , in arguably the best performance of his distinguished career , plays mitchell stephens , an intense man of quiet misery . 

mitchell is the outsider in the story set in a small , snow-encrusted community in the british columbian wilderness . 

his mission there is a singular one , to sign up the parents so that he can sue someone , anyone , on their behalf . 

if this seems crass , well it is , but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot . 

the story unfolds slowly and always believably . 

each little aspect has its own fascination . 

as mitchell interviews wendell and rita walker , played with quiet realism by maury chaykin and alberta watson , he has a simple task . 

he wants them to suggest some model couple in the village who has a lost a child so that he can use that couple to form the basis of the suit . 

wendell ticks off one town member after another and then , as one can in a small town , enumerates each person's numerous faults . 

although the town is no peyton place , people there do have their foibles . 

one of the best parents in the town appears to be billy ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who rides his pickup behind the school bus everyday just so he can wave good-bye to his kids . 

well , single parent billy's fault is that he has regularly scheduled trysts with the married rita . 

his confessions to rita about his feelings of loss are one of the many heartfelt outpourings in the story . 

the accident itself , a simple one of a bus hitting a patch of ice , isn't shown until the middle of the picture , but , nevertheless , the mystery about it builds throughout the film . 

although the picture is no detective story , finding out exactly what happened is a subtheme in a movie that is primarily a character study of a town gripped by tragedy . 

as the injured bus driver , gabrielle rose , dolores driscoll plays the role of a dedicated individual who loves kids with a passion and for whom the tragedy takes on special meaning . 

to round out the story , mitchell has his own private tragedy to bear . 

his daughter zoe ( caerthan banks ) is a drug addict who has bounced in and out of one half-way house and recovery center after another . 

fond of calling her dad on his cell phone so she can ask for money or help , she interrupts him at many emotionally charged moments as he attempts to sign up the townsfolk . 

 ( "" i can help you , "" mitchell tries to reassure billy . 

 "" not unless you can raise the dead , "" billy snaps back . 

mitchell's pitch is never an easy one and worrying about zoe only makes it harder . ) 

mychael danna's haunting music sets the stage for tragedy . 

the cinematography by paul sarossy is sweeping in its outdoor grandeur , but it is in the warm , shadowy , intimate moments indoors where it works best . 

the show , which is ripe for emotional manipulation , never plays with its audience . 

still , when the house lights go up , you may feel as i did . 

i could barely breathe ; i was so overcome by the sum total of what i had witnessed . 

more than anything , the film is like a master painting . 

each cinematic brush stroke is carefully laid down by egoyan with the beauty building with each dollop of paint . 

with the final color in place , the masterpiece is complete , and the ending credits roll . 

the sweet hereafter runs 1 : 50 . 

it is rated r for mature themes , sexuality and some profanity and would be fine teenagers . 
"
" "" pokemon 3 : the movie "" has a lot of bad things in it . 

first of all it's a plot heavy mess that has bad voice talents , badly written script and fantastic animation . 

the first film came out the end of 1999 and was a huge hit grossing almost $90 million domestically . 

a sequel soon followed and even made $45 million . 

warner has released their third movie based on the immensely popular video game and tv series and its a waste of time and celluloid . 

this time ash ketchum and his friends are on their way to the johto battles ( which my little brother told me the new spinoff is "" pokemon : the johto journeys "" so go figure ) anyway he comes in contact with a young girl who's father has disappeared after trying to discover the unown . 

they are small pokemon with a powerful punch and have great psychic abilities . 

the unown bring together their psychic abilities and create entei a powerful legendary pokemon who barriers young molly's house and creates every wish she wants . 

now it's up to ash and his friends to stop this pokemon entei and show him to be a good pokemon rather than a bad one . 

too bad really that this is a bad movie , surprisingly the first movie was entertaining and somewhat absorbing , the second was a piece of trash and this one is almost in between . 

it has some good qualities ( animation , message in the end ) but the flaws seem to overpower the goods . 

i'm still not sure what the big thing is about pokemon , they are ugly little animals who speak their own name for their language ( besides meowth , my personal favorite ) and you don't understand what they are saying . 

my little brother just thought the movie was amazing , and i kept leaning over and asking him happened , or what pokemon that was . 

his response was a big lecture of how this is that , and that is this . . . he 

sure did put me in my place . 

with the second and third movie being bad , i have a feeling pokemon 4 : the movie might be a total bust as well . 

 "" pokemon 3 : the movie "" has some redeeming qualities for the kids , and the pokemon fans will dig every minute of this film . 

for those parents and/or brothers and sisters who have to sit through this . . . bring a pillow . 
"
" "" spawn "" features good guys , bad guys , lots of fighting , bloody violence , a leather-clad machine gun chick , gooey , self-healing bullet holes , scatological humor and a man-eating monster . 

it not only appears to have been tailor made for a swarm of 12- and 13-year-old boys , it appears to have been made by them . 

in a classic example of telling and not showing , "" spawn "" opens with a truckload of mumbo jumbo about forces of darkness , forces of light and how "" men are the ones who create evil on earth . "" 

so much for a message . 

the movie then lurches forward into the plight of al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government assassin/operative who is murdered by diabolical boss jason wynn ( martin sheen , who plays all of his scenes like an oscar clip ) while on a top secret mission in a north korean biological weapons plant . 

simmons goes to hell and back , after making a deal with satan himself -- if he agrees to command the devil's army to overtake the world , he'll be allowed to return to earth to see his wife wanda ( underused theresa randle ) and little girl cyan ( sydni beaudoin ) . 

of course , seeing as how five years has passed , wanda has fallen for -- and married -- simmons' partner ( d . b . 

sweeney ) . 

his , uh , shoulder to cry on comes in the form of clown ( john leguizamo ) , a disgustingly disproportioned minion of satan's . 

clown manipulates simmons , now in superhuman spawn form , into a stand off with wynn . 

wynn , who thinks he is in league with the double-dealing clown , recognizes spawn as a threat and undergoes an operation where a bomb is placed on his heart -- when it stops beating , major cities around the world will detonate , causing the leak of a disease that "" makes the ebola virus look like a skin rash . "" 

phew . got all that ? 

it would be easy to dismiss "" spawn "" as just another one of those heavy-on-fx , short-on-substance action pics , but it doesn't even work on that level . 

the computer-generated sequences are often and plenty , and the problem is that they look too computer-generated . 

the several scenes set in hell present a devil that looks and acts like a video game graphic -- with the movie's healthy budget you'd think they could have afforded to make his mouth move when he talks . 

other elements of the movie are so-so ; spawn's enormous red , flowing cape is a wonderful sight , but it's too obvious when he's being played by a costumed actor or an image . 

in movies like "" contact , "" the special effects serve the story . 

in "" spawn , "" they are the story . 

and spawn himself isn't even an interesting character . 

the film's reliance on razzle-dazzle would be acceptable if we were given somebody to root for , but both simmons and his funky alter-ego are completely underdeveloped . 

what we need is a batman , a luke skywalker . 

even watching the adventures of kleenex man would be more interesting than spawn . 

poor leguizamo . 

he starred in february's "" the pest , "" a movie that i still think is the year's worst so far , although this one does give it a run for its money . 

as clown , he overacts to the extreme , never missing an opportunity for a poor-taste punchline . 

leguizamo farts green mist , munches a pizza slice covered with maggots and even dons a mini-skirt and performs a cheerleader routine , all before turning into a giant grey demon . 

the guy was brilliant in "" to wong foo , thanks for everything ! 

julie newmar . "" 

what is he doing wasting his talent in this and "" the pest "" ? 

i'm one of the few people that liked "" batman & robin , "" this summer's other big-budget comic book film . 

yet after catching this movie and making the inevitable comparison , i can only hope people will change their minds and think of "" batman "" as the superior adaptation . 

there's a compelling story somewhere in "" spawn "" -- including strong religious overtones and the debut of the first african-american superhero ever -- but it's just not found anywhere near here . 

as it is , "" spawn "" is just awful -- it stinks worse than a dead trout . 
"
"originally titled 'don't lose your head' , this parody of the scarlet pimpernel story was the first carry on to be produced by rank film productions . 

two english fops , the 'powdered , be-wigged , be-ribboned' sir rodney ffing ( sidney james ) and his counterpart lord darcy pew ( jim dale ) decide to travel to revolutionary france in an attempt to rescue their fellow french royalists and aristocrats from losing their heads by the guillotine . 

due to a series of machinations and disguises , they are largely successful . 

ffing becomes known as 'the black fingernail' because he leaves a calling card behind which shows two fingers sticking up , one with a black fingernail . 

after the fingernail rescues a prominent royalist the duc de pommfrit ( charles hawtrey ) , citizen robespierre ( peter gilmore ) orders the head of the secret police citizen 'the big cheese' camembert ( kenneth williams ) and citizen bidet ( peter butterworth ) to follow the fingernail to england and do away with him . 

 ( in fact , darcy and ffing are their coachmen ! ) 

once at calais , the fingernail meets jacqueline ( dany robin ) and they fall in love instantly . 

he tells her his identity and gives her his locket . 

when camembert realises that the fingernail is nearby , he searches the inn at calais and captures jacqueline , thinking that she is wearing a diguise and is really the fingernail ! 

jacqueline is imprisoned in the bastille and camembert , his love desiree dubarry ( joan sims ) , and bidet all travel to london in pursuit of the fingernail . 

they pretend to be of noble stock , calling themselves the duc and duchesse de la plume de ma tante ( with bidet their assistant ) and are invited by darcy to a ball held by ffing . 

desiree finds out that ffing is the fingernail by wearing the locket around her neck , but she ends up falling in love with him . 

ffing attempts to stall camembert so that he can return to the bastille to rescue jacqueline , camembert has her moved to the 'chateau neuve' , and a climactic sword-fight decides who will lose their heads at the end of the film ! 

a more complex story than most carry ons , this film enjoys good production values ( sets , costumes ) and an on-form cast . 

sid james is excellent as the english fop and black fingernail , kenneth williams excels as the evil camembert , and peter butterworth expertly plays the substantial part of camembert's thick-witted crony . 

other acting honours go to joan sims who is perfect as desiree and charles hawtrey who is excellent as the french aristo pommfrit . 

although it suffers from a disasterously over-long sword fight at the end of the film , it is largely successful due to the performances of the main stars , its slick and professional production , and its better-than-usual script . 

definitely one of the best of the series and a joy to watch . 
"
" "" when will the devil take me ? "" he asks rhetorically in lulling voice over . 

the spoiled title character of _onegin_ ( pronounced oh-negg-in ) is waiting on death to relieve him after a lifetime of rapacious behaviour . 

martha fiennes' debut feature is ( quite literally ) filmed poetry ( it's based on an epic russian poem by alexander pushkin ) , a profound study of regret , of how we confuse shame with guilt . 

when we first meet eugene onegin ( ralph , acting for his sister ; another brother , magnus , composed the score ) , a philandering aristocrat from st . petersburg , he has just inherited his uncle's estate . 

with plans to sell it , onegin pays a summer visit to the manor , which is located in an underpopulated russian countryside , and not long into the trip he meets a neighbouring family of blue bloods . 

smitten with olga larina ( headey ) , he befriends olga's fianc ? , vladimir lensky ( stephens ) , while olga's sister , tatyana ( tyler ) , romanticizing his flippant attitude ( he's a nineteenth bad boy ) , falls for onegin . 

in one sweaty , inky torrent of passion , tatyana writes him a love letter . 

he is at least intrigued by the note but rejects her affections , it is implied , because he can . 

soon after , tragedy strikes , and onegin makes himself scarce . 

when we catch up with him , six years later , he has just returned to st . petersburg , where at a grand ball he discovers that an old friend ( donovan ) has married a more womanly and wordly tatyana . 

this time , onegin finds her irresistable . 

what is most amazing about ralph fiennes' performance is his subtle physical transformation from dashing snob to miserly grouch . 

overwhelmed by a top hat , the onegin who pines for tatyana seems smaller in stature than the one who brushed her off , an ebeneezer scrooge trapped in christmas past . 

the actor has been constricted playing heroes for too long now-there's room to breathe in a role that's made up of shades of gray like "" onegin "" . 

petula clark sang of a universal phenomenon in "" parking lot "" : "" you don't know what you've got ? til it's gone . "" 

onegin's about-face on tatyana speaks for those of us ( read : most of us ) who need confirmation that someone or something is wanted by others before we want it as well . 

what the character feels is not jealousy but remorse , embarrassment , even , at having let her go . 

out of identification we feel empathy for onegin , a callous bastard . 

tatyana's emotions echo a thousand ditties , but that makes them no less vital . 

she changes , too , from a girl in crush to a woman with divided loyalties . 

tyler acquits herself surprisingly well among her uk co-stars , filling in sketchy gaps by expressing base sentiments in a series of wanton stares . 

they both have faces , mr . fiennes and ms . tyler , capable of conveying archetypal russian misery . 

_onegin_ could have added up to little more than a distinguished episode of "" masterpiece theater "" , even with its current cast of thoroughbreds intact , were martha fiennes not at the helm . 

an mtv background ( she cut her teeth directing rock videos for xtc and others ) has positively influenced her sense of pace ( though , thankfully , not her shot lengths-no spasmodic cutting here ) ; at just over 100 minutes , _onegin_ clicks along like a brisk walk through valleys of despair . 

the film has an atypical period look , as well . 

absent are the sumptuous tableware and antique furnishings that stand in for plot and character in those drippy merchant ivory productions . 

the sets are almost expressionistically bare , echoing the loneliness of the protagonists . 

 ( cinematographer remi adafarasin often allows space to engulf them ; i'm reminded the climax , which unfolds in a sea of white . ) 

martha fiennes has a clear command of cinema , and her spare , often painfully human visual presentation of "" yevgeny onegin "" is arguably the most lucid translation of pushkin's difficult text yet . 

ms . fiennes may be the most exciting female presence behind a camera since jane campion . 
"
"look ! the new version of "" psycho "" came out and the world didn't end ! 

i guess gus van sant really isn't the bringer of the apocalypse ! 

unfortunately , though , that "" psycho "" didn't end the world as we know is the best thing that can be said for it . 

van sant's controversial "" re-telling "" of alfred hitchcock's classic 1960 film has polarized filmgoers everywhere ( even before it premiered . ) 

without benefit of an actual viewing , many have said that the film will , at best , suck . 

being an ( almost ) good critic , i waited until i actually saw it to decide that the film , at best , sucked ( and that concludes the use of the word "" suck "" and , hopefully , the thoughts that i am a brain-dead orangutan . ) 

director gus van sant took the original hitchcock film and refilmed it , shot-for-shot , using the same , exact script ( with a few minor alterations . ) 

the inherent challenge was in making the film suspenseful and scary , even though a large group of the audience will know exactly what will happen at the exact time . 

suspense probably could have been attained if the actors had been able to create something new or different than the original . 

sadly , that did not occur . 

it is hard to be overshadowed by vera miles and john gavin ( from the original "" psycho ) , but that is what exactly happened to julianne moore and viggo mortensen . 

in moore's case , the film would have been helped if "" the x- files "" gillian anderson had been cast instead ; especially since moore goes through the entire film doing a scully impression ! 

from the cold demeanor and expressions to her rigid way of forming a sentence , moore is scully ! 

mortensen ( who i liked in "" g . i . 

jane "" ) opts to play sam loomis as a cowboy/hick , which would have been nice if he had gone past that starting point . 

sam has a twang and a cowboy hat , but that's about it . 

mortensen turns in one of the most uptight performance in recent memory . 

anne heche , in the janet leigh role , does a few good things in her brief time on screen . 

at least her marion crane has a little life in her , which can't be said for most of the rest of the cast . 

the best work , though , comes from vince vaughn , as the demented mama's boy , norman bates . 

he's not going to make anyone forget anthony perkins , but he is effective both in being naughty and nice . 

the best part of the film is the dinner scene heche and vaughn , where they simply talk . 

there is some solid acting there , something that is not carried through the rest of the film . 

van sant has made a boring film . 

all the camera tricks that hitchcock so eloquently used in 1960 aren't as eye-catching now . 

what passed for brilliance then has been copied so many times by so many directors that they don't impress or excite . 

van sant , in what i assume is a grasp at originality , decided to put some stream-of-consciousness images into a few famous scenes ( was that a lamb in the middle of the road ? ) 

these images , included with some questionable editing choices , took away from the scenes themselves and caused , at first , bewilderment and , later , laughter . 

definitely not hitchcock's intention ! 

at least danny elfman had the good sense to not mess with bernard herrmann's original famous and terrific score . 

if a film like "" psycho "" does not frighten , then what's the point . 

aside from norman , the characters are thinly drawn people who leave no connection with the audience . 

there are things van sant and company could have done to at least make their recreation interesting . 

in the end , however , the new "" psycho "" is a noble attempt , but , alas , a dismal failure . 
"
"in brief : best bleak comedy film since heathers . 

full of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture . 

go see it ! 

so , i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on "" hard copy "" with pam smart , the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980's . 

 "" hard copy "" 's diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman's fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for . 

smart replied that she thought kidman's character came off as a dumb , vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal . 

 ( smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband . ) 

smart's got a point . 

it wouldn't be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well-acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version . 

however , given a choice between the mass media 'happening' of the real event and the fictionalized movie , i would definitely opt for the later . 

real murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart , while pretty and alluring , is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman . 

to die for begins in a town called little hope , new hampshire , the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb . 

the story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being 'on tv . ' 

of course , one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry , played by matt dillon . 

but , with a little imagination , some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement , our heroine manages to overcome the nay-sayers in her life , at least temporarily . 

kidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne . 

i have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture . 

her portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates . 

kidman knows a star-making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience-deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven , post-feminist uber-temptress from hell . 

she is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue , which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way . 

at one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister-in-law . 

 "" you know , "" she knowingly exclaims , "" gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever , if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head . "" 

her husband beams at suzanne's profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters . 

this is very close to pop culture bashing heaven , folks . 

the other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix . 

he plays jimmy , a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne's sexual favors . 

kidman's character , vapid though she is , is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia , winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland . 

phoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen-x slackerhood ( as envisioned by tabloid tv , of course ) . 

his jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain't going anywhere , ever . 

phoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne , someone who actually noticed him . 

gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , my own private idaho ) direction is first-rate . 

he keeps the pacing in this not-quite-thriller snapping along . 

van sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesn't stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions . 

van sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to 'get it' without stopping to explain what is funny about this all-american story . 

the screenplay , by buck henry , is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i've heard since heathers . 

henry's story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame , yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters . 

henry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini-classic . 

danny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric , loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands . 

either film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick-or-treat parties . 

all-in-all , a wonderful production , well worth your seven bucks ! 

to die for : a columbia pictures release directed by gus van sant . 

written by buck henry score by danny elfman starring nicole kidman , matt dillon , joachin phoenix based on the book by joyce maynard .

"out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey , a cold , uninvolving , confusing new thriller . 

though the plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of elmore leonard ( author of out of sight , as well as jackie brown , get shorty and pulp fiction ) , after you watch it , you realize that it's not nearly good enough . 

in an aggressively non-linear fashion , the limey ( li * mey , noun : an english gentleman ) tells the story of wilson ( terrence stamp ) , a british ex-con just released from a 9 year stint in prison for armed robbery . 

he has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny . 

he doesn't know much about the circumstances of her demise , all he has is a name : terry valentine . 

valentine was jenny's former boyfriend , a wealthy and corrupt record executive . 

he's played by peter fonda , in his first major role since the terrific ulee's gold in 1997 . 

seeking valentine's reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson . 

he finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in just as valentine is having a big party . 

he winds up breaking his cover eventually , setting off valentine's head of security and valentine himself , who decides to run for it . 

what a mess . 

i have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time -- pulp fiction , which twisted time every which way , was a masterpiece -- but i do take exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer . 

the limey does exactly that . 

the plot is permeated with flashbacks , flash-forwards and what can only be described as random time-travel , without any evident purpose . 

there is no method to this movie's madness . 

it uses a fancy way to tell a story that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably . 

the plot isn't particularly interesting in the first place : traditional , mildly hackneyed and not very involving . 

this is a sort of brooding film -- our protagonist doesn't speak much and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude . 

i felt like the director wasn't very interested in the proceedings himself , almost like he made this film for a paycheck . 

ditto for the editing , which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant . 

sixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal . 

he's not much in the way of stature but he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here . 

peter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor : he's shy , quiet but always effective . 

he's adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression : his feelings don't always show on his face by you can always tell what they are . 

this is basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion . 

why soderbergh couldn't just parrot down and tell a story , i don't know , but what he does do certainly doesn't work . 

the result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil -- even the action scenes don't work . 

1999 may have signified the death of the traditional act one - act two - act three storyline , but obviously some movies have not yet transcended it . 

shall we go back to basics ? 
"
"this is a stagy film adapted from roger rueff's play "" hospitality suite . ''its 

about three travelling salesmen attending an industrial convention , whose chicago company has sent them to wichita , where the company has paid all their expenses for them to rent a hospitality suite on the 16th floor of the hotel , where they aim to score a substantial account from the big kahuna , someone named dick fuller , who is the head of a big industrial corporation . 

he is someone they have never met before , but they want to sell him industrial lubricants and they want desperately to land this new account , it is their only reason for coming to the convention . 

 "" the big kahuna "" revels in salesmen-talk among the three white christian males , two of them , larry ( spacey ) and phil ( devito ) , who are veteran salesmen , having teamed together for the last twelve years , while bob ( facinelli ) is a young man who has just recently been hired by the firm and works in the research department . 

these three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting to meet the big kahuna , as the focus of this claustrophobic film is on their interactions in the hospitality suite . 

the three salesmen have different things on their mind that is troubling them and a different attitude to their job , and they are each going through internal changes that are profoundly altering their life . 

the outstanding cast tries to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why . 

what comes into question is their opinions on life and death , on god and morality , and on how they make a living . 

these are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch . 

their dialogue is acerbic , witty , and analytical . 

following in the long tradition of salesmen films -- from death of a salesman , the tin men , and glengarry glen ross , as this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high . 

in this case , it is landing the big kahuna . 

they each are trying to see why he's on top and why they are chasing after him . 

what makes this film different than the others , is its blatant religious message , comparing orthodox religion to what they do , as both must sell their product . 

and how after each one's psyche is stripped clean by the other , there is a pause and some lesson about life has sunk in that is pertinent to each . 

the goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna , but in finding out what bill of goods they sold themselves that made them be salesmen . 

larry and phil have one way of doing things and have no qualms of incorporating a sales pitch as part of their life . 

bob thinks he is above the fray and he pitches every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ . 

his vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by a disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his actions the words of jesus he literally believes in . 

bob is a baptist , who takes a very non-questioning and literal attitude about religion . 

to just look at another woman and lust after her is a sin , according to the way he reads the bible . 

when asked by larry why he married his wife , he seems puzzled and can't even say because he loves her , only that marriage is something sacred to him . 

the contrast in their personalities is stark . 

larry is all business , he simply wants to close the sale . 

he comes into the room pumped for the convention , using his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being a salesman . 

he criticizes phil for being so placid , for getting such a small suite , for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp , and for being burned-out . 

he tells him to go on a vacation . 

get a woman . 

while phil is reflective on where all his best years have gone for him and is contemplating a career change , now that he is 52 and is painfully divorcing his wife , after having lived too lonely a life on the road for too long . 

he now finds himself suffering from some troubling dreams and questioning what he believes in . 

he has always been a charmer , shaking everyone's hand , trying to please his clients while trying to make the sale . 

larry is more aggressive as a salesman , he is always a heart attack away from every big sale . 

in contrast , bob is only in his twenties and everything seems fresh to him . 

this is his first time for him on the road . 

when dick fuller doesn't arrive at the party the salesmen throw , larry becomes confrontational and asks phil if he spoke to the man himself about the gathering . 

when told that he spoke to the secretary , larry throws a tantrum and is resigned to going back to their home office without the new account . 

but when they start talking to bob , whom they forced to act as the bartender , they are surprised to learn that fuller did indeed come but was wearing another man's name tag and that bob spent the entire evening consoling the tycoon over his recently deceased dog and then talking to him about jesus . 

bob then tells the boys about a private party fuller is attending afterwards , and that he invited bob to attend . 

larry and phil can't fathom how bob didn't make a sales pitch . 

but they soon take another tact and decide to prep bob on how to get fuller's attention about their company's product as they sent him off to meet fuller , and will await his return in the hotel room . 

these two sharp salesmen are reduced to waiting for this smug kid to come back and tell them he saved their ass . 

the irony of their situation is played out in the darkness of the hotel room , as they stay up late into the night trying to make sense out of their lives . 

these three performers were outstanding , each understanding what their role called for , each coming through with a marvelous performance . 

the only problem with the film , is that its more of a play than a cinematic experience . 

but the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics , give it an intelligent selling point and make it a good product to see . 
"
"it's a curious thing - i've found that when willis is not called on to carry the whole movie , he's much better and so is the movie . 

even though , in the sixth sense he is the "" name "" , he doesn't have the pivotal role . 

that honour goes to haley osment who plays cole sear ( cute pun , seer ) a 9 year old boy who can see ghosts . 

if osment was cute or precious , the director going for the maudlin , this would be nothing more than a movie-of-the-week , thankfully , osment is not only better than that , but in some instances , blows everyone else off the screen in a bravura performance . 

we get to see his fears , vulnerabilities , strengths and intelligence which makes the sixth sense one of the best movies i've seen this year . 

the whole cast matches him in quality , with willis giving a fairly low key performance that matches the subject matter . 

one thing about this movie , its target . 

this isn't a sfxfest like the haunting or a gorefest , this is more what i'd call a supernatural drama , more interested in characters than in dazzling you with makeup . 

one caveat : there's a lovely twist in the movie , something like the usual suspects , where you end up replaying the movie in your head rethinking what you have just seen . 

i was extremely lucky to see it as a sneak preview in toronto , before any hype or critical reviews were out , so i went in with no biases . 

if anyone want to talk to about the movie before you see it , don't let them . 

let the director explain on his own pace and you'll enjoy the movie vastly more .

"larry flynt is a self proclaimed smut pedlar and the owner/publisher of the multi-million dollar hustler publications company . 

the people vs . larry flynt is the story of larry flynt's fight for the freedom to circulate and sell his pornographic magazine , hustler . 

based on a true story , the film is almost a documentary in that it's a very vivid and detailed look at larry flynt's life . 

woody harrelson gives an excellent performance . 

he conveys flynt's peculiarities and his character with depth and focus . 

by the end of the film the audience actually finds themselves , somewhat grudgingly , liking larry flynt . 

this is some feat given flynt's apparent lack of any morals or ethics and his extremely smutty and childish behaviour in court . 

however , flynt has a number of things going for him , he's rich , he's funny , and most importantly , he says exactly what he means . 

larry flynt's wife , althea leasure is played by courtney love . 

larry meets althea at one of his clubs , and they fall in love ( a very sexual and open love ) . 

both of them indulge in a world of too much sex , and eventually too much drugs . 

flynt had been taking an excessive amount of pain killers after being paralysed from the waist down ( which was especially upsetting for him ) by an assassin . 

althea had joined him in taking the drugs . 

following an operation flynt decides to stop taking drugs , althea does not have any such plans , nor the determination to follow them . 

as the film progresses we see her become increasingly frail and sick . 

courtney love obviously has a great understanding for althea's situation , as she is brilliant in portraying althea in every respect . 

it's extremely sad to watch althea literally wither away . 

edward norton plays flynt's lawyer , alan isaacman . 

again , this is a solid performance . 

the audience finds it easy to sympathise with isaacman who somehow puts up with flynt's courtroom antics . 

flynt is not only childish in the courtroom , but downright rude to the judges , and lands himself in a lot of trouble ( and even in a mental institution ) because of it . 

isaacman is very easy to like , and great at proving ( in quite clever ways ) his points to the court . 

milos forman has done a great job in directing the people vs . larry flynt . 

it is not really an exciting or thrilling film , but instead a highly interesting portrayal of a true story . 

due to larry's character it is also , at times , a very funny film . 

however , it is much more than that . 

it is about the fight for freedom of speech , anti-censorship , and the right to be able choose for oneself what to see and buy . 

an excellent look at flynt , his life , and his story . 

keep a look out for the real larry flynt who makes a cameo as judge morrissey . 
"
"zero effect gets its title from the main character , daryl zero ( bill pullman ) , although we don't understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film . 

zero is a private investigator , perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived ( at least he'd like to think so ) . 

however , he's a socially inept being , and eccentric in every possible way -- this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are . 

zero's accomplice is steve arlo ( ben stiller ) , a "" normal "" guy who does the business side of the job -- he's the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero's greatness as an investigator . 

the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero's talents to soon-to-be client gregory stark ( ryan o'neal ) . 

it turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box , and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about . 

zero takes the case , and the plot thickens . 

his path leads to a young , pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) . 

despite her luminous and seemingly-harmless presence , she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark . 

through his investigations , zero learns why , but not without developing feelings for gloria -- feelings that , because of his reclusive behavior , are new and confusing to him . 

i have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film . 

i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators , and , every once in a while , a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away ( actually , no private eye film has ever reached chinatown's greatness ) . 

zero effect , which is jake kasdan's first effort as writer/director , is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts : it's an original , funny , and completely involving motion picture . 

with so many cliches available to this genre , i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them . 

but he didn't just successfully avoid flaws : he has created a great film here , one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment . 

take , for starters , the great cast of characters . 

pullman is terrific as zero , showing a comic flair that i really haven't seen from him since spaceballs . 

zero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here ; the fact that he's an almost exaggeratedly twisted , emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe . 

pullman's performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance , and the occasional voice-over as he's going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious . 

ben stiller is also a very funny individual ; he's the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny . 

 "" i'll shoot you , "" he says to stark at one point . 

 "" i have a gun , and everything . "" 

his character is also well-drawn , with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend ( angela featherstone ) who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job . 

o'neal also gives his character a bit of depth ; and kim dickens , last seen ( and underused ) in mercury rising , gets a chance to show us her talent here , giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs . 

i find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film . 

kasdan's humor is of the best kind -- soft spoken , and mostly dialogue-driven ( though there are some great visual jokes ) . 

it's the kind of humor that's funny even after you've seen it five or six times . 

there's one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is , an how that makes him such a great detective . 

what we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed , or standing motionlessly , with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face , his eyes pointing to something off camera , but obviously to nothing in particular . 

i can't convey to you how funny this is , but what makes it great film making is that it has a point -- scenes like this are frequent , and they provide solid characterization of zero . 

as a side note , i don't consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy ( not to sound elitist ) -- i find things funny that many do not , and vice versa . 

there was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film , and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it . 

i have a feeling the humor here won't appeal to everyone , but there's certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone's interest . 

jake kasdan , son of writer/director lawrence kasdan , is only 22 years old . 

i found this out after seeing the film , and i can't remember ever being so impressed with a film maker . 

his direction is stylish without being pretentious , and his writing is mature , full , and developed . 

zero effect is the kind of film that i'll buy for my collection -- smart , original films like this are rare as it is , but this one actually has a heart and a soul . 

at the end of the film , i was involved in the characters , and i was satisfied with the outcome . 

and , with kasdan's undeniable talent at such a young age , all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future .

"a thriller set in modern day seattle , that marked marky mark's migration from the "" good vibrations "" and "" calvin klein undie ad "" guy , to mark wahlberg , thespian-at-large , and a mighty good one at that . 

plot : boy ( wahlberg ) meets girl ( witherspoon ) . 

boy likes girl . 

girl likes boy . 

boy and girl begin dating . 

parents of girl aren't crazy about the boy . 

girl steps to boy's defense . 

family problems occur . 

girl learns more about the boy . 

boy goes nuts . 

fun ensues . 

critique : ever wonder what would happen if your better half turned out to be someone other than the person that you had come to cherish and love ? 

well , if you ever have , then this film is definitely for you . 

it isn't the most original premise in the world , but it is handled pretty well here , and pretty quickly for that matter ( a speedy 90 minutes ) . 

i think one of the main reasons this film worked for me is the groundbreaking performance by mark wahlberg ( of boogie nights infamy ( 7 . 5/10 ) . 

he completely captured all the goodness , and badness , of the main character of this film , and always kept me wanting to see more and more of him ( his performance scored him a solid nomination from his core target audience , as "" best villain "" at the 1997 mtv movie awards ) . 

the soundtrack is also very effective in this setting , and of course , the slutty performance by alyssa milano is something we could all indulge in ( look for the nice bikini and butt shots . . . if 

you're into that kind of thing , that is : ) . 

i didn't much care for the father/david relationship which seemed to be a little too contrived , but for the most part , i was really into this movie . 

then again , daddy dearest did have one of the coolest lines in the movie when his wife is asking him what the "" big deal "" was about his daughter dating david . 

his reply : "" the big deal is that the guy gives me the creeps , and the girl is my daughter . "" 

good point . 

all in all , the movie kicked some fun ass , mindless as it was , and effectively demonstrated every parent's worst nightmare . 

mind you , i still can't tell if reese witherspoon is good looking or a douchebag , but hey , life goes on . 

and on a personal note , we finally decided to add some taco meat onto our nacho fiesta of usual , and let me tell you all . . . it was a flaming success ! ! 

another firm recommendation by joe schmoe ! 

little known facts : director james foley was the man responsible for the critically acclaimed glengarry glenross ( 8/10 ) back in 1992 , at close range ( 7 . 5/10 ) in 1986 , and even directed an episode of twin peaks in 1990 . 

mark wahlberg stands 5 "" 9 , is born in massachusetts , dropped out of highschool ( later got his ged ) , and was convicted of several minor felonies before starting his career as the lead singer of marky mark and the funky bunch . 

his brother is donnie wahlberg of new kids on the block fame . 

he is also testing the waters on the acting front .

"by phil curtolo "" madonna - antonio banderas - jonathan price - in an alan parker film - with music from andrew lloyd weber - and lyrics by tim rice - evita . "" 

now i have to admit , the trailer for this rock-opera-turned-major motion picture is almost breath-taking for some . 

the soundtrack is wonderful to listen to . 

so why wouldn't the movie be wonderful to see . 

simple , a little over 2 hours of constant singing can almost drive you insane . 

the story of eva duarte ( madonna ) , evita is full of drama that's trapped inside by all the notes and chords . 

she was an orphaned child who ends up becoming a hooker , then goes into the field of acting , and finally meets juan peron ( price ) , the soon-to-be first president of argentina . 

they fall in love and eventually marry . 

sounds pretty good , doesn't it . 

well the story gets better , as eva goes on the "" rainbow tour "" across europe , trying to win respect . 

eva duarte was a wonderful lady . 

however , all of the drama-packed moments above were never understood because the actors and actresses sang to fast to be understood . 

i went into theater 4 at magic cinemas with the attitude that evita was going to be terribly boring and i left with happy , because i was right . 

they only thing that kept me awake during the movie was the loud bangs of the drums and strums of the guitar . 

although it did come off as dull , the beautiful cinematography is eye-catching , as was madonna's performance . 

as the "" spiritual leader of argentina , "" madonna would have definitely been an oscar-contender had she spoken a single line . 

but her chance was taken away with the stubbornness of making an exact replica of the broadway musical a film . 

don't get me wrong and don't look at my grade . 

i am not a big fan of musicals on the big screen . 

if you're going to pay to see a movie , you want to see a movie . 

now i have to admit , it's a lot cheaper to pay $5 than $200 plus to see the play , but that's what did me in . 

all this review contains is my opinion and my grade was set before i even saw the movie . 

now you may be saying , "" what kind of critic is he ? , "" 

and you're right . 

as a critic , i should have given the movie a chance . 

but as a 17-year old quentin tarantino fan , it was way too hard .

"slavery is bad . 

after hundreds of years , we've finally figured that one out . 

this almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg's latest "" serious "" film . 

during the late 1830s , a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men and women kidnapped from their home on africa's west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery . 

fifty-three of them are stuffed into the "" la amistad "" ( from a spanish word for "" friendship "" ) by their new spanish owners . 

freeing himself from his chains , senge pieh ( djimon hounsou ) , renamed cinque by his masters , leads a bloody revolt . 

after killing most of the crew , the africans force the remaining sailors to return them to their home - or so they think . 

instead the ship heads up the coast to the united states . 

the amistad is boarded by an american naval ship and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for murder and piracy . 

the legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property . 

if they are property , who do they belong to ? 

their masters ? 

the spanish government ? 

salvage rights of the officers who captured the ship ? 

the us government ? 

the defendants are pawns in several games . 

abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) want to free them , but tappan sees them primarily as a means to further the cause . 

their lawyer roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) views the case as a simple one of property rights and a chance to make his share of legal fees . 

south carolina senator john c . calhoun ( arliss howard ) pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states . 

president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) is willing to force the result towards his own political ends . 

when the verdict looks to free the africans , van buren replaces the judge with one more sympathetic to his wishes . 

even that doesn't work and the new judge frees the kidnap victims . 

at the urging of calhoun , the president then appeals the case to the supreme court , populated by a majority of slave-owners . 

this little-known ( try finding it in any history text book ) incident from america's past would have gone down a darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) who is persuaded to argue the case before the supreme court . 

the slavery issue is easy pickin's for spielberg . 

much like his "" shindler's list "" ( which followed "" jurassic park "" as this follows "" lost world "" ) , the moral sides are not difficult ones to choose . 

nazis and slave traders : both treat groups of others as less than human . 

it's not hard to see who the bad guys are . 

without that question to ponder , the director's job is more difficult . 

he has to make the story interesting . 

spielberg succeeds for the most part . 

the visual aspect of the film is beyond reproach . 

where the movie falls down is a bit more subtle . 

there are very few _people_ in the tale . 

in fact , cinque is the only character who is fleshed out . 

tappan and joadson are "" abolitionists "" : symbols but not humans . 

van buren is a weak politician but nothing else . 

the rest of the "" slaves "" barely exist other than dressing for the set . 

like many other films about people of color , almost all the major players are white . 

the film's salvation lies in the acting strength of everyone involved and the powerful presence of hounsou . 

the former model's first major role is a winner . 

without speaking more than five words of english , he conveys more emotion than most actors with a thousand lines of dialog . 

the other stand-out is hopkins who seems to be making a career out of portraying american presidents ( he also played the title role in "" nixon "" ) . 

the impassioned speech by the doddering old man who phases in and out of rationality is among the best court-room drama ever on the screen . 

there are some other great moments . 

especially impressive are the african's struggle to understand what is going on in the strange land . 

their interpretation of the bible based solely on the pictures and their own experiences is poignant . 

as grand as the epic is , it would have more impact had it focused more on the experience from the point of view of the africans . 

more humanity in the fight for humanity would have made it a four-star film .

"it was once said that in order to truly enjoy some of todays movies or novels , you must suspend disbelief .  

however , there is a distinct separation between opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing a bunch of flat lies . 

it came as no surprise to me to learn that huntingburg , indiana ( where the film is set ) , does not have a mcdonald's , a sears store , a statue of a man on a horse , nor even a dam close by . 

even if you can ignore these somewhat white lies ( even though the dam is crucial to hard rains plot ) ; there is still a bunch of things that just dont gel . 

firstly , morgan freeman , possibly the greatest actor alive ( after such films as driving miss daisy , the shawshank redemption and se7en ) , was cast as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement . 

he _should_ have played the town sheriff , an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman . 

as a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg , its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases . 

i say presumably simply because we never know what happened to them ; and it seems a tad strange that an entire town ( with the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way ) can vanish before the flood has actually started . 

but nether the less , armored guard couriers tom ( christian slater ) and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van . 

with a heavy rainstorm causing depressing conditions and slippery roads , it doesnt take long for the van to end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of the road . 

jim ( morgan freeman ) and a small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt to steal the three million dollars . 

but of course tom is more than willing to save the day , so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town . 

the local sheriff ( randy quaid , whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in id4 ) and a couple of police men investigate the situation , but their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates what he/she would do with their share of the three million dollars . 

director mikael salomon has made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsy-turvy , and whilst the film may at first appear to be a definite goodies versus baddies ,  there are numerous twists in its plot that make this a slightly more enjoyable experience . 

but by the time these interesting changes occur , its far too late in the film for them to have much affect . 

hard rains continuos corniness and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may have had ; and although its cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par . 

not at one stage capturing what could have been a fabulous on screen battle between slater and freeman , we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do something different and achieved more than what was expected . 

such titles as broken arrow ( slater and john travolta ) and face/off ( nicholas cage and john travolta ) come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations . 

strangely enough , they were both directed by john woo and both star john travolta . 

we can forgive morgan freeman for giving a slightly disappointing performance since he is newish to the action genre , but christian slater could have achieved so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced and some personality added to his character . 

if you had asked me whether slater could perform well enough to substantially boost a movie prior to the release of broken arrow , my answer would have been a definite no . 

i now know that he has no excuse , and _can_ do better ( if you dont believe me rent a copy of broken arrow from your local video store ) . 

although hard rain never really works from the start , i somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen . 

the addition of an enticing sub-plot would have given the film time to breathe , rather than try to cram 96 minutes of action and disaster into a story that cant handle anything else . 

despite the fact that hard rain fails on almost every account , if your standards are low enough you may find this to be a mildly enjoyable film . 

no creative flair and no inventive scenes means that hard rain does not stand up well against its many competitors , but it doesnt really matter since the last thing you would want to do after shelling about $8 . 50 is compare this to other films .

"synopsis : lifelong friends rafe ( affleck ) and danny ( hartnett ) join the us air force and are stationed at pearl harbor , hawaii . 

rafe goes to england to fight alongside british pilots and is seemingly killed in action . 

danny falls in love with rafe's girlfriend , evelyn ( beckinsale ) , but rafe survives and returns to confront his former friend . 

meanwhile , the japanese sneak attack is imminent . . . 

review : "" pearl harbor "" is a perfect example of movies as product rather than as art . 

it is little more than a crassly-calculated attempt to woo the masses , enticing them with big stars , big effects , and a big setting -- but no heart . 

it is difficult to criticise the actors , because they do everything the movie demands of them . 

sadly , this amounts to barely more than reciting dialogue of such sheer banality that it makes one eager to see the script randall wallace wrote with his right hand at the same time as he was writing "" pearl harbor "" with his left . 

the plot here is pure cliche , and the wartime setting simply a convenient backdrop . 

there is no genuine exploration of what pearl harbor meant to the united states , and no insight into its vital role in inciting that country to join world war ii . 

instead , there is just an assembly-line love triangle , some empty patriotic rhetoric , and a laughable attempt to placate japanese viewers via the inclusion of some reticent imperial commanders ( when one intones , "" i fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant "" , i nearly fell out of my seat ) . 

to the movie's credit , it does include a fantastic portrayal of the attack itself , an exciting and dizzying hour which plunges viewers into the war . 

if only the remaining two hours had been crafted with such skill , perhaps this memorial day non-event would have been worth watching . 
"
"capsule : this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii , life in a japanese prison camp . 

to end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity . 

the somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyone's taste . 

 , +3 ( -4 to +4 ) 

more than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way . 

this may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law . 

during world war ii , of course , the one goal was winning the war . 

this led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal . 

when the japanese had captured prisoners , they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal . 

minimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output . 

while the germans , not known for their kindness in those days , had a 6% mortality rate among captured prisoners of war , the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was 27% . 

the best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad . 

that railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do . 

the best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day . 

and just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll . 

in the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany . 

filmmakers have been reticent to tell the story , perhaps for fear of offending the japanese . 

there are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps . 

certainly there was david lean's the bridge on the river kwai . 

there were some low-budget british exploitation films and that was about it . 

then there were tv series "" a town like alice "" and "" tenko . "" 

lest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa . 

it is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for 26 years the dean of the chapel at princeton university . 

the film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them . 

the story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad . 

it turns out to be a grim joke , one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves . 

beating and torture are commonplace events . 

men already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health ; it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable . 

however , unlike as in kwai , the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital , called by the prisoners the death house . 

so goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a rail-laying machine . 

this is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies . 

the japanese believe that the individual is nothing , that conformity to group's norms is all that gives a life meaning . 

conformity is purpose . 

before the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp . 

if this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story . 

if the british ( with one american , by the way ) and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story . 

it is neither . 

it is a stirring and believable account of camp life . 

the color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out yellow . 

this serves a double purpose for cunningham . 

it gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat . 

it also creates a distancing effect . 

the only touch that seems a little out of place is the use of gaelic music . 

this is a powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience . 

i rate it a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +3 on the -4 to +4 scale .

"plot : a young french boy sees his parents killed before his eyes by tim roth , oops . . . i 

mean , an evil man . 

he vows revenge on that man and is taught the ways of the musketeer by some old dude who used to be one himself ? 

anyway , fourteen years go by and . . . arrgh , well , you know the rest . . . swish-swish-zzzzzzz ! 

critique : this is a pretty bad movie . 

let's see , where should i start ? 

okay , first of all , the story is just plain boring . 

it's not original , is entirely predictable and lacks energy . 

okay , what's next ? 

acting , you say . 

hmmmm , well , the main actor , justin chambers , is basically an uncharismatic version of chris o'donnell but with less range ( think about that ! ) , and mena suvari , is just plain off . 

not as bad as thora birch was in dungeons & dragons , but entirely miscast , with bad deliveries , awful sequences and a piss-poor accent that comes and goes . 

now i'm not sure if this was ms . suvari's fault or the director's , but i've definitely seen her at a much higher level than in this film . 

the only semi-saving grace actor-wise is tim roth as the irrepressible "" bad guy "" , but once again , it's not something that we haven't seen before . . . a 

thousand times . . . by the same guy ! ! 

tim , please . . . for the love of god , beg your agent to ask the marketplace for some modern day "" american roles "" for you as a "" nice guy "" in a romantic comedy or something . 

stretch , dude . . . stretch ! ! 

we all know that you can do much better than this gunk . 

alright , what else was bad in this film ? 

oh yeah , the score ! 

yikes , how's about taking it down a few notches there , fellas ? 

this thing blares in your ear whenever it feels the need to accentuate a certain scene , but actually does little more than annoy . 

i think it's important for the man behind the music to recognize that this film isn't a "" real epic "" by any stretch of the imagination . 

it's a fluffy rehashed cake-walk created by some "" shrewd "" studio heads who decided to take advantage of the whole "" kung-fu "" phenomenon in films , and test it out on an old classic . 

dudes . . . you 

failed all around ! 

 ( keep reading ) 

the editing is also pretty shoddy in this movie , the dialogue banal and stilted and the plot problems . . . plentiful ! 

 ( why does the guy on top of the horse carriage just stand there when his opponent takes forever scampering his way back to the top ? 

why don't they just cut the mouseketeer's rope at the top of the tower , instead of jumping down on their own chords and fighting him while hanging ? 

why doesn't anybody look a day older , when the sequence says "" 14 years later "" ? 

 ( at least . . . change 

your shirt , man ! ) 

keep in mind that i have never strayed away from championing certain movies that are created simply for the sake of a "" fun time "" , but this flick just didn't cut it for me . 

it was boring for stretches , the acting was atrocious at times ( the "" romantic "" scene between suvari and chambers next to the lake reminded me of plays in high school which made you cringe ) , there was little reason to care for anyone and since when were the musketeers fat ? 

i will give the movie this much , and that is that its main reason for being ( its "" raison-d'etre "" , as the french would say ) , its fight sequences , do come through despite the lack of their numbers in the film . 

i was hoping that the movie would be packed with cool stuntwork as promoted in its trailer , but what you see there , are essentially the snippets from the two major ( and cool ) swashbuckling sequences from the film . 

the first comes right at the beginning of the movie , while the other essentially finishes the film off , hanging from the tower and juggling off ladders . 

the ladder sequence itself is a definite keeper but unfortunately the rest of the movie is just regurgitated crap . 

and can anyone please tell me how catherine deneuve got her name placed at the top of this film's credits ? 

hullo ? 

the film is called the musketeer and stars a dude name justin chambers . 

deneuve is barely in this movie ! 

ugh , just another small thing that annoyed me about this trash . 

now say it together , gang : "" all for one , and one for all . . . we 

vow to stay away from it all ! ! "" 

thank me later . 

where's joblo coming from ?

"synopsis : rumored to be about a true person , the story of mulan has circulated in oral tradition for over a thousand years , and has inspired operas , literature , and even coinage . 

 ( since 1984 , china has been issuing annual gold and silver coin sets commemorating famous historical figures ; the 1992 set includes mulan . ) 

in the ballad of mulan ( written in the 5th or 6th century ) , an imperial edict by the khan ( emperor ) orders men from each family to be drafted into the army to defend china . 

a girl's parents hear sighing , and think that their daughter mulan ( the name means magnolia ) is dreaming of boys , but actually she's dreading what horrors might befall her old infirm father if he were to be drafted off to battle . 

mulan bravely runs away , masquerading as a boy , to serve in the army instead of her father . 

ten thousand miles and twelve years of brutal war later , the army finally returns in triumph . 

the emperor wants to reward mulan's valor with a prestigious position in government , but she declines , accepts a horse , and returns home quietly to don her true clothes . 

mulan's old army buddies visit and get the shock of their lives when they find out that mulan is actually a woman . 

the disney animated feature mulan is similar to the ballad story , only it adds a modern character for comic relief : mushu the dragon ( eddie murphy ) . 

in disney's mulan , when a fierce army of invading huns threatens to overrun peaceful china the emperor orders one man from each family to be conscripted into the army . 

old mr . fa ( soon-tek oh ) is handicapped and has no son ; he has only his spirited young daughter mulan ( ming-na wen ) . 

fearing for her father's life , the courageous mulan secretly cuts her hair , disguises herself as a man , and sneaks off to serve in the army in her father's stead . 

meanwhile mushu , the disgraced and demoted guardian dragon of the fa family , has been reduced to the size of a squirrel and the status of incense burner . 

 ( his only duty is to ring a gong . ) 

mushu hits upon a plan to redeem himself and regain his guardian status by helping the disguised mulan to become a macho male warrior hero . 

with the help of mushu , a horse , and a lucky cricket , can army recruit mulan save china and bring honor to the fa family ? 

opinion : east meets west . 

i know a chef in santa fe that does this sort of magic ; he combines asian culinary influences from the west coast with latin american from down south and european from the atlantic to concoct new creations that hit just the right combination of flavors . 

from their state of the art animation studio in orlando , disney is hoping to work the same kind of east/west magic with mulan . 

i mean , what would you say if i told you that a new movie featured tang dynasty art , with donny osmond singing , ming-na wen acting , and eddie murphy playing a chinese dragon that makes pop references to batman and the reverend jessie jackson ? 

yet this is the case in the disney's re-interpretation of the familiar chinese classic . 

the end result is spectacular ; mulan is one of disney's best movies ever . 

personally , i'm also glad to see the detestable american stereotype of the weak-willed subservient asian woman take a beating : mulan is portrayed as a normal , if spirited , compassionate gal capable of taking the initiative . 

mulan is more than just eastern graphics and faces combined with westernized pop and disney . 

kids of any age will like the family themes , and will understand the good guys versus bad guys thing . 

and adolescent and preteen girls can appreciate the romance factor , while the boys admire the battles . 

and adults can admire those male/female nuances as well as the interplay between traditional notions of family , honor , and duty with industrial age notions of romantic love , gumption , and questioning . 

but even the tiniest details reveal quality . 

the movie's art supervisors spent three weeks in china researching the right look : negative spaces , positive detail , period clothing , and graphic designs typical of the time and place . 

computers were used for crowd scenes of up to 30 , 000 people , and a special program called 'attila' was used for a spectacular sequence involving 2000 attacking huns on horseback . 

and singers osmond and salonga are at the top of their game . 

balance is crucial . 

a movie about a chuckling lone dragon played by eddie murphy might not be disney's cup of tea , but if you use the character as a comic sidekick to balance a determined and spirited heroine , then , pow ! 

the dream team . 

by the same token , a tale about a girl in the army might be a sober exercise in filial piety by itself , but toss the dragon in there and you've got enough wahoo individualism for a light hearted disney romp . 

it's rare that a movie can seamlessly combine elements from both east and west , old and young , male and female into a cohesive and entertaining whole , but mulan hits the universal bullseye . 

it's movie for any age , creed , gender , or color . 
"
"renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed with jean-claude van damme on the action star's 1997 pairing with dennis rodman , _double_team_ , and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick , stylish , and somewhat diverting action timekiller . 

tsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels , _knock_off_ , but this time around , style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous , and at worst incomprehensible ; nor hide a host of truly lousy performances . 

writer steven e . desouza's fairly straightforward plotline isn't as outre as _double_team_'s strange yarn involving a secret think tank/prison , but it makes about as much sense , which is little . 

van damme plays marcus ray , a hong kong-based sales rep for a jeans company ( ! ) who stumbles upon a russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchip-sized bombs in hk product exports to the u . s . --dolls , electronic equipment , and , yes , jeans . 

it's all part of some type of ransom scheme , but all i remember is--and i kid you not--graphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world , bombs detonating , and an hat-wearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter . . . 

 . . . which is what the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout _knock_off_ . 

while all of van damme's films have its share of unintentional laughs , mostly due to the stiff acting "" skills "" of the physically agile van damme , _knock_off_ delivers more than usual ( though not as many as van damme's embarrassing directorial effort , 1996's _the_quest_ ) . 

a lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza : "" i smoked that badass like a roman candle ! "" 

and "" entrepreneurship , babycakes ! "" 

standing out among my favorites . 

but it is indeed the pathetic performances that provide the bulk of _knock_off_'s laughs . 

van damme is true to laughable form , perhaps even worse than usual . 

early scenes actually _require_ him to make funny with co-star rob schneider ( improbably cast as a deep cover cia agent posing as marcus's business partner ) , and the sight and sound of the still-heavily-accented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious in the wrong way . 

even typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug . 

paul sorvino is unconvincing and terribly overwrought as schneider's cia superior ; and lela rochon , playing an investigator for the jeans company , spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode . 

in rochon's defense , though , her role requires her to do little more than display her toned legs , exquisite bone structure , and perky bosoms , the latter coming in handy for one key scene where she must fish for microbombs stuck in her ample cleavage . 

tsui picks up where he left off visually in _double_team_ , juicing up the proceedings with inventive camera work . 

here , though , tsui's visual razzle dazzle borders on over kill , coming off as desperate attempts to shield the inanity of the entire enterprise . 

for each nifty trick tsui pulls off , such as a recurring visual theme that has the camera literally going through the circuitry of electronic devices , there are others that are completely superfluous . 

this is especially disconcerting when the trick in question could be clever when used in the right context . 

for instance , one scene early on has marcus putting his hand in a box . 

as he puts his hand in , the same action is shown from an overhead camera angle in a rectangle at the corner of the screen . 

it's undoubtedly an interesting visual , but it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something . 

the test of a van damme movie boils down to the action sequences , but surprisingly , those in _knock_off_ leave much to be desired . 

tsui does what he can to make something of them , employing freeze frames , blurred motion , and unconventional camera angles , but there is nothing fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase and fight sequences written by desouza . 

there isn't anything as preposterously amusing as the climactic tiger/land mine fight in _double_team_ , let alone anything remotely close to tsui's legendary hong kong works ( but that's a given going in ) . 

if tsui has any hope of approaching his countryman john woo's stateside success , he would do best to break free from van damme . . . 

before it's too late . 

if he continues his involvement with b-grade movies such as _knock_off_ , the respect he has from hk action fans will continue to diminish . . . 

that is , if it hasn't already disappeared entirely after this fiasco . 
"
"m : i-2 , the sequel to mission impossible , is a james bond wannabe film , but it fails to even come close to that film in wit , humor , and entertainment value . 

it tries to be a spy/romance movie , but without any suspense the film just looks like it's an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses . 

it is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human . 

the coolest thing about this movie , was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie , was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols . 

the film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence . 

except for the choreographed action sequences , the film was dull for three-quarters of its time , filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed . 

as for the action scenes , they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films , but their advertisement for sadistic responses , is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence , which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen . 

m : i-2 opens and closes with fast-paced action scenes , but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue . 

the film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus , at that point . 

the only thing that kept me awake , was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film's supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way . 

it's a mega-buck film adapted from a popular high-tech gadgetry tv series . 

but its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it , and it failed to produce a story that had any substance . 

john woo ( "" broken arrow "" / "" face/off "" ) is good at doing car chases , choreographed fights with midair flips and kung-fu kicks , slo-mo shots of two guns blazing , and of fire explosions , but he just can't seem to handle dialogue and suspense . 

the star of the film and co-producer , tom cruise , and his romantic interest , thandie newton , are miscast . 

cruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile , as he tries to carry off this macho role , while thandie is not an action-film girl , and seems like a fish- out-of-water in this one . 

their romance didn't work , not only was it tepid and not sexy , but it wasn't convincing . 

the film opens with dizzying speed , perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success . 

we will be in three different locations instantaneously : sydney , the american southwest , and seville . 

first , we are in sydney , australia , where a scientist with a muffled russian accent , dr . nekhorvich ( rade ) , mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it . 

he also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain . 

which explains the film's mythic theme . . . as 

we enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil . 

the one who played the villain , dougray scott , does so in a one-dimensional gruff tone , which did not distinguish him in that role . 

at least , if the film got the villain part right , it might have had some fun with this nonsense . 

soon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri , but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains . 

before they crash the plane and parachute out of it , the one who was posing as dimitri , turns out to be sean ambrose ( scott ) , a rogue member of the imf , which is a cia-like clone . 

he steals the package with the antidote , peels off a latex mask , which is a replica of the hero of the story , ethan hunt ( cruise ) , who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust . 

sean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices . 

we already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face/off and in the original mission impossible , which as convoluted a plot as that film had , it was still a superior film to this sequel . 

woo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground , as it is used so often in this film by both sides , so much so , that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain . 

it makes it seem as if anyone could be another character , which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense . 

next we are in a mountain range in the american southwest , and ethan is on vacation , hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool , when a helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard , delivers via a rocket launcher , a pair of talking sunglasses . 

hunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help , billy baird ( john polson ) and luther stickell ( ving rhames ) , with luther running a high-gadget computer , but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall ( thandie ) to join his team . 

he is told , as an incentive to recruit her , all her criminal charges will be dropped . 

hopkins then signs off with the tag line : this message will self-destruct in five seconds . 

actually , with the departure of hopkins , it was this disposable film that actually self-destructed at this point . 

in seville , hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist and a subsequent car chase , where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of a mountain road . 

he also falls for her when this was only supposed to be a business deal , and learns that she is valuable because her ex-boyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants to f * ck her . 

the imf team then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f * ck him , as she leads them to his hide-out in the seaside of australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous cohort , the south african , hugh stamp ( richard roxburgh ) . 

robert towne , the screenwriter , who contributed to the first "" mission , "" who is noted for doing "" chinatown "" -- writes a colorless , pedestrian script , one that fails even to be funny in a camp way . 

the terrorists , who aim to rule the world , are interested in owning 51 percent in a biotech company and in getting stock options , as they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote , insuring that they will make billions on the stock . 

ethan comes to the rescue of the world and of nyah , with his only conflict being who is more important to save first . 

ethan does this rescue against all odds , as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company , fight it out with sean and the other terrorists , and rescue nyah , who injected herself with the virus to hinder sean's getting it , as the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle . 

ethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle , using kick-boxing , winning a shootout , throwing a full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists , making some more use out of that peeling mask bit , and by being completely fearless and larger than life , while he kick's everyone's ass . 

if i was only entertained by this . . . i 

could have lived with it . 

but this film was so badly made , that it was like watching a highlight film of a basketball game , seeing only the slam-dunks , but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast . 

in any case , this is a critic-proof film , and will in all probability do well in the box office , as it was made to appeal to all the demographics who find commercial ventures like this one easy to buy into .

"a movie about divorce and custody in 1995 seems about as timely as a movie about mood rings . 

family breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american landscape for nearly thirty years , and countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious court battles in hand-wringing detail . 

still , i can't recall a comedy about the subject before bye bye love . 

and after it , i still can't . 

bye bye love is rarely funny , more often a weak and melodramatic retread of common tv-movie fare . 

only a few moments which have nothing to do with the film's main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion . 

bye bye love follows one weekend in the lives of three divorced fathers who get weekend custody of their children . 

dave ( matthew modine ) , a father of two , is an inveterate womanizer having difficulty staying faithful to his latest girlfriend ; vic ( randy quaid ) is a foul-humored father of three about to go on a rare date ; donny ( paul reiser ) pines for his ex-wife and has trouble relating to his teenage daughter emma ( eliza dushku ) . 

over the course of the weekend , the three men face various crises , including vic's blind date from hell ( janeane garofolo ) and donny's growing estrangement from emma . 

the three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo , and the quality of their performances is of widely varying quality . 

randy quaid is the best of the three , bitter without being irritating , gleefully spiteful without being frightening . 

his run-ins with is ex-wife ( lindsey crouse ) are a bit over-played , though , and his confrontation with a pompous radio psychologist ( rob reiner ) is gimmicky and implausible . 

he does get bye bye love's best sub-plot , a hilarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo , and he does a great slow burn . 

paul reiser really has only one character , his slightly befuddled , uptight nice guy "" mad about you "" persona , but he does it well . 

as a personality , he is appealing , but as a character , he becomes pretty boring here . 

matthew modine , is , quite simply , terrible . 

this isn't a performance good enough to be called mailed-in ; he even forgot to put a stamp on it . 

modine lacks any charm in an appallingly under-written role , looks bored most of the time , and gets stuck with a trite little speech about how it's all his father's fault he's such a cad . 

carolco's executives , whose entire future is resting on modine's bankability for the upcoming cutthroat island , must be sweating buckets right now . 

bye bye love basically comes off as a very confused movie , because it spends far too much of its time on the new relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers and their kids , making it just another "" dating in the 90s "" movie . 

when the movie does deal with the children at all , it is to have one of them scream out an accusation and/or cry , perhaps to be resolved later by a sensitive talk and a hug , perhaps not . 

even more confusing is a sub-plot featuring the late ed flanders as a widower who goes to work and a mcdonald's and befriends a troubled youth . 

it is a sad end to flanders' career , getting caught up in a truly annoying over-use of mcdonald's as a location , a plot device and , apparently , a major advertiser . 

even if bye bye love had decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on the parent-child relationships , it still would have been pretty difficult to pull off , because ultimately there is very little humor one can wring from family break-ups and their effects on children . 

any way you slice it , it is a bad situation for kids , and the makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings when dealing with the single parenting issue . 

it is left to the dads' romantic fumblings to probide what little humor there is , and it isn't enough . 

there have been comparisons between bye bye love and parenthood , but parenthood was both genuinely funny and genuinely touching . 

bye bye love is a genuine shame .

"director jan de bont certainly knows how to make top quality action films . 

you need look no further than die hard ( he was director of photography ) , speed and last years twister for examples of his hi- octane , edge of your seat thrill prowess . 

speed 2 is no exception . 

this time , the action takes place on a huge cruise liner , on which sandra bullock and jason patrick are trying to develop their relationship . 

yep , that's right , no keanu reeves this time , but fear not , jason patrick is more than up to the job . 

speaking of which , the job at hand is to stop completely bonkers terrorist , willem dafoe , from crashing the liner into a huge island , after stealing a diamond collection . 

the reason for this act of destruction is revenge . 

after years of working for the company that builds cruise liner computers , he contracts copper poisoning and is retired . 

naturally , what entails next is a lot of running/jumping about and general high quality action as jason patrick does his level best to save the day . 

thinking back on this film , you can't help , but admire it's structure . 

the way , willem dafoe initiates his plan and throws red herrings to the crew and passengers . 

the race against time to save the liner from crashing , and of course , the finale chase scence . 

 ( although this is ruined by an over the top , one too many stunt and explosion . ) 

simple in construction , effective in it's execution , and the result , a clear and concise , highly enjoyable action film . 

the acting is adequate , although it's darned obvious that sandra bullock is only in it to create a 'hot totty' appeal to the men ( and she does that perfectly ! ) , jason patrick fills the action hero role superbly and willem dafoe is just great as the crazed terrorist . 

overall , speed 2 is a most enjoyable thrill ride . 

not up to it's predecessor's high calibre but very good all the same . 

there is plenty going on , some of the thrills are quite tense and it also proves that you do not need blood and guts to make a good action movie .

"there's a scene somewhere in this film where one of the characters reads the book "" screenwriting made easy . "" 

this is funny the first time just 'cause it is , but funnier as the film goes on since it's totally ironic since the screenwriters of this inane film probably read it , outlined it and then wrote this film . 

it's like they took the sub-genre of the disaster pic , which can be fun and hokey at the same time , and then forgot one of the greatest parts of them : the stupid , eccentric characters . 

yes , "" the poseidon adventure "" is crap , but it's fun 'cause of all the stupid , eccentric characters . 

and "" earthquake , "" my god ! 

 "" earthquake "" has got to be one of the worst movies of all time , but at least they had the joke of having charlton heston sleeping with genevieve bujold . 

 "" volcano "" takes a semi-intriguing yet stupendously inane plot ( a volcano no one knew about suddenly errupts one fine morning and then erupts again later then stops . . . only 

it's in , dare i say it ? 

l . a ! ! ! ) and then puts no stupid , stereotypical , eccentric characters in it . 

they're just stupid . 

and the actors are all good ones . 

tommy lee jones is great , an oscar winner , and a member of the men in black ( my vote for what should be the coolest movie of the summer ) . 

anne heche is a good indy actress . 

don cheadle stole the disappointing "" devil in a blue dress "" from denzel's feet . 

and gaby's one of the few good teenage actors . 

but they get nothing to do but act dumb and scream at what's going on . 

they do their best , god bless them , but they're all lost in the fake magma ( only don cheadle gets an interesting part and he's the greatest part of the film ) . 

there's no real suspense here 'cause you don't care about anyone . 

i actually was rooting for gaby's character to get killed so tommy lee jones wouldn't have to keep saving her ( he did it like thirty times ! ) . 

and there are no interesting sites in l . a . that we see get destroyed . 

part of the fun of disaster films is watching sites get toppled or destroyed or whatever . 

in "" independence day , "" the best part ( other than judd hirsch ) was watching the white house and empire state building get blown up by the aliens . 

that was cool . 

watching really fake-looking magma plow down the street is not . 

okay , so the film's not devoid of merit . 

as i already stated , don cheadle was great and the cast does their best . 

and there's this really moronic scene which looks cool . 

john carrol lynch ( norm from "" fargo "" ) goes on a subway car to save people but the lava comes and surrounds it . 

he has one guy who's wounded and could make it . 

he could throw the guy and jump and still survive . 

but no ! ! ! 

he has to go and inanely jump and land right in the middle of the lava . 

here's the cool sight : he melts . 

here's the dumb part of it : he somehow manages to throw the man to safety as his legs are melting . 

cool sight . 

no logic . 

but cool sight . 

the volcano erupts twice and for some reason , the film ends there . 

they aren't worried about it eruting again , they just go home to their toppled homes . 

but to tell the truth , i was glad they didn't go on . 

i was hoping the film was over after the first eruption ended . 

my god , it was actually painful to sit through this little 102 minute long film . 

i haven't seen "" dante's peak "" but i've heard it's a masterpiece compared to this . 

if you want to see a cool disaster flick that's inane but interesting , rent "" the towering inferno "" with steve mcqueen , paul newman , and the schweppervescent o . j . 

simpson ( he saves a cat ) . 

if you want to waste your time watching a boring , stupid disaster flick ( literally , it almost grossed half of its budget ) , see this . 

but i warned you .

"the premise of the new james wong film , final destination , is that alex browning , the protagonist , prevents six of his friends from boarding a doomed airplane , thereby cheating fate . 

however , fate is not so easily bested , and alex's friends soon begin dying in unusual circumstances . 

essentially , this premise is a clever-way to make a slasher-flick without the slasher . 

unfortunately , this is practically the only clever thing about the film . 

as far as teen horror flicks go , final destination is better than many . 

there is enough shocking death , graphic gore , and requisite black humor to provide the essential "" roller coaster "" type thrill at the heart of the average horror flick . 

unfortunately , this film also suffers from the worst characteristics of this genre . 

the relationships between the main characters are tenuous and their motivations are meaningless except as excuse to set-up the next death . 

the scene where two of the characters break into a funeral home to view the body of their recently killed friend is suppose to be scary and dramatic but features some of the dumbest dialogue i have witnessed . 

if you are looking for a saturday night thriller to scare your date , this film might do the trick . 

other than that , wait until it goes into heavy-rotation on cable .

"what i look for in a movie is not necessarily perfection . 

sometimes a movie has such strong ideas that despite whatever flaws it may have , i will prefer it to a better-made film that is not as thought-provoking . 

the thin red line is flawed but it provokes . 

terence malick returns to filmmaking 20 years after days of heaven and produces this meditative look at war . 

unlike this year's saving private ryan , which dwells on war as a necessary evil and explores the moral ambiguities thereof , the thin red line simply says war is waste . 

while that might seem obvious to some , only after experiencing the film do you realize how profound a waste it is . 

saving private ryan has an underlying and practical acceptance that war will occur and it has a great cost ; the thin red line says idealistically avoid this at all costs . 

one message is not necessarily more correct than the other . 

it just depends on one's point of view . 

in malick's film , war is set in a tropical paradise , and john toll's cinematography is beyond lush . 

the setting poses the question , why are we fighting in the face of such beauty ? 

in saving private ryan , the capture of a german soldier presents the moral quandary of whether to let him go . 

in the thin red line , the japanese present the moral quandary of war in the first place . 

they are just like the americans -- frightened and angry , grieving and praying . 

all that separates them is war . 

the flaw in the thin red line comes in the voice-overs . 

unbelievable as coming from the characters and sometimes pretentious , sometimes corny , the voice-overs tell us what the images before us already do and are completely unnecessary . 

dispensing with them , malick could have achieved a tarkovskian grandeur . 

instead , he gets distracting self-consciousness . 

aside from that , malick's direction is stunning . 

the tracking shots across windswept hills and around transports speeding toward shore are extraordinary . 

sean penn , elias koteas , and nick nolte give the best performances . 

penn is subtle as a sergeant trying to hide his humanism , koteas is genuine as a compassionate captain , and nolte startling as a colonel whose blood vessels are about to burst if he cannot win his battle . 

john travolta and george clooney are the worst in cameo roles . 

ultimately however , the thin red line's interest is not in the characters and it is not in drama . 

it has been frequently criticized for its lack of dramatic structure , but malick clearly has different things on his mind . 

has no one ever thought that getting dramatic entertainment from war is exploitative ? 

what malick is working with is theme , and in that , the thin red line is most provoking .

"writers : dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh ( based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer ) 

starring : jamie lee curtis , william baldwin , donald sutherland , joanna pacula , sherman augustus , marshall bell , cliff curtis , julio oscar mechoso 

i suppose i'm not extremely surprised that "" virus "" comes to us from a deciple of james cameron ( john bruno ) , and if i strain real hard , i could even say that it's an obvious given , particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr . cameron's early works . 

in fact , "" virus "" is yet another in the long line of action/horror/paranoia thrillers from the "" aliens "" vein : a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally-threatening entity is out to get them , a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies , and maybe even to the first pictures , albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future . 

no such thing will happen to bruno , whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi-landmark feature ; while bruno may have studied under cameron's wing for years and years , i'm beginning to wonder at what capacity , and what exactly did he learn from him . 

in fact , "" virus "" should at least be mediocre ; the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron - a director who , if anything , just knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like "" virus "" is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z-grade schlockfest of a film , albeit a z-grade schlockfest with a respectable budget . 

the film seems to not only borrow it's plot from last year's similarly-fated "" deep rising , "" but also from a clunkish b-movie from the '80s called "" leviathan , "" an underwater thriller starring peter weller , richard crenna , hector elizando , and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part "" alien , "" part john carpenter's twisted remake of "" the thing . "" 

 "" virus , "" again , has a similar , uh , selling point : a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water . 

they get on . 

they break up into pairs and investigate . 

and they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy , has taken over all the machines on board , have meshed the machines with parts from corpses , and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ( ha ha ) . 

not that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving ; not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond-ian opening ( the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir ) , destroying any of the suspense in what could happen , but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters . 

of its motley crew , it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper , a masculine potential-romantic-interest , a drunken captain , a black technician , a tatooed aborigine , a manic russian survivor , and a couple other candidates for alien food , none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin , plain piece of writing paper . 

and it's not the traditional argument for films like these , where you may in fact want them all to be eaten ( even "" aliens "" played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers , but this was more of a plus-side for the film as a whole than the opposite ) ; instead , as another cliche goes , you just don't give a damn . 

i almost don't even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub-par to horrific , the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is ( and she is , just not really here ) and the latter being - and it pains me to say this as he's a particular favorite of mine - donald sutherland , who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance-of-which-he-should-be-ashamed . 

like anthony hopkins for "" legends of the fall "" ( the line "" scrooooooo 'em "" has been thus embroidered upon my membrance ) . 

or peter o'toole in "" caligula . "" 

great actor , horrific performance . 

it happens every now and then , and it only helps sutherland's career that no one , except for an elite few , even bothered to see this film . 

though it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years , waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can ( read : early january , when everyone's still trying to catch up on the potential oscar-nominees ) , it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film : it's laden with complex machinery , boasts respectable production design , and it may even feature believable special effects . . . if , of course , i , or anyone else , could see them . 

 "" virus "" mostly takes place on a large , abandoned cruiser , and mostly at night until the dawn , and mostly without the use of lights , not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey , but more so because , as the hollywood cliche seems to go , "" if it's dark enough , then the special effects will be more believable . "" 

and if you don't believe me , go back and rent "" godzilla , "" and tell me if there's even one shot where we see godzilla either a ) in his entirety in one wide shot , or b ) n the light so that we can at least see him ( well , you don't really have to sit through it again ; just take my word for it ) . 

but all of this doesn't matter since "" virus "" is basically just one loud , cluttered mess of a movie . 

the action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie i've ever seen ( my , um , favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship , during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves , rain , and any other ocean-extremeties the film can cook up , then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned - well , i must say , thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldn't figure it out when i saw it ) . 

imagine the first attack of the aliens in "" aliens , "" shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity , and that's basically the whole of "" virus "" : one horribly-directed action scene after the other , capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members . 

and my god , it's a long damn sit . 

with no interesting characters , no dramatic urgency , no tension , not one good moment of action , and no mesmerizing visuals , it's a wonder that it even got made . 

we already know that big movie studios' mentality is shallow at best , and movies like "" out of sight "" and "" saving private ryan "" give you more faith in them , but movies like "" virus "" manage to drain a little more out of the pool . 

i almost wish that instead of making this movie , john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light . 

they read the script , they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack ( and he is ) , and they still went ahead with the project , only to have bruno and company shit back in their face . 

even though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie , i'd say even more contempt should be aimed at mr . bruno for making a movie that could be this bad . 

in fact , shouts of "" egad , man , what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway ? "" 

are not only justifiable , but encouraged .

"susan granger's review of "" hearts in atlantis "" ( castle rock/warner bros . ) 

timing is everything , and the timing just seems right for this poignant psychological drama that combines the coming-of-age nostalgia of "" stand by me "" with the mystical power of "" the green mile . "" 

based on stephen king stories adapted by screenwriter william goldman and directed by scott hicks , it's set in 1960 in harwich , connecticut , where fatherless 11 year-old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin ) lives in a boarding house with his resentful , self-centered mother ( hope davis ) . 

he's devoted to his neighborhood friends ( mika boorem , will rothhaar ) but his pivotal relationship is with a strange , new tenant , ted brautigan ( anthony hopkins ) who opens the world of literature to him after his selfish mother refuses to buy him a birthday gift and hands him , instead , a library card . 

knowing he's longing for a schwinn bike , ted offers to pay him $1 a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for signs of the malevolent , ominous low men who are chasing him to exploit his special powers . 

the story structure consists of one long flashback , framed by the present , featuring the adult bobby ( david morse ) , minimizing the supernatural elements while emphasizing the human drama hopkins' mysterious character is genteel , sensitive and benignly seductive . 

the only explanation is that he's a psychic who is wanted by the fbi to aid in their hunt for communists and even that seems appropriate , given the inexplicable state of the world right now . 

the production values and performances are solid , particularly hopkins - arguably the finest , most versatile actor of our era - and the children with whom he forges a firm bond . 

on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" hearts in atlantis "" is a wistful , enigmatic 8 , evolving with subtle power to an emotionally effective catharsis .

"roberto benigni is a clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton . 

this italian film star , best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther , has done the near impossible by creating a comic fable about the holocaust . 

but benigni's life is beautiful ( la vita e bella ) is not so much a story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop to tell a story of familial love , devotion and sacrifice . 

the movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with benigni's guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in 1938 to fulfill his dream of owning a bookstore . 

like many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him , most notably the almost-forgotten harry langdon , benigni's guido has a childlike innocence . 

he ignores the growing anti-semitism of the fascist government . 

instead , guido ardently falls in love and persues dora , a local school teacher who already is engaged to a local fascist official . 

in benigni's tightly wound script this is the same fascist official with whom guido had an earlier unfortunate - yet slapstick - encounter . 

guido wins dora . 

they marry . 

fast forward about five years . 

guido , dora , and their 5-year-old son , giosue ? ( giorgio cantarini ) are a happy family . 

guido has finally fulfilled his dream of opening a bookstore . 

but racial and anti-semitic tensions are on the rise in italy , and guido has determined to do his best to shield his son from these harsh realities . 

the task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported to a concentration camp . 

here , guido must use all his skill and imagination not only to shield his son , but to keep him from being exterminated . 

it is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend to offend those whom the holocaust has touched . 

for the scenes in the concentration camp lack the horror , the pain , the unimaginable suffering of a schindler's list . 

true , many italian jews were not deported until the war was nearly over , and most were not sent to the death camps , but to work camps where they were used as slave labor . 

unlike steven spielberg , benigni is not out to tell the story of the holocaust . 

his story is about family and the lengths a parent will go to protect a child . 

for guido , to save his son , transforms the entire experience into an elaborate game . 

giosue ? must follow the rules without question to amass 1 , 000 points . 

the winner takes home a tank . 

therefore , guido tells him , he must remain hidden in the barracks . 

he cannot make a sound nor allow the guards to see him . 

guido explains this during a hilarious sequence when a german guard barks the camp instructions to the newly arrived inmates . 

guido , lying that he understands german and can translate for his fellow prisoners , instead lays down the rules for his son to allow him a chance to survive . 

throughout their imprisonment , guido's quick thinking continually keeps his son from harm's way . 

ultimately , the allies rescue the camp . 

in a poignant scene , giosue ? comes out of hiding just as an american tank rolls into the compound . 

the boy goes wide-eyed with wonderment and delight , thinking he has won the game . 

the price for his victory is most high . 

benigni has succeeded in using the blackest moment in human history to prove that even in hell , a ray of hope and salvation can penetrate the darkness . 

life is beautiful is a fantasy , a fable . 

it is not to be taken as a record of the holocaust . 

those who object to it are missing its point . 

and that is simply where there is hope , where there is life and where there is love , the spark of humanity will never be extinguished .

"if there's one thing in common about all of hollywood's major studios , it's that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more . 

although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures ( fox searchlight and fine line respectively ) , it's obvious there's no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater . 

so when a movie like gary ross' pleasantville comes along , wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production , it's a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes . 

although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted , pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no-thought movie . 

quite the opposite is true , in fact , as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen . 

the story , both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation , captures the essence of statement-making in the cinema . 

not in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution , and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross' work , it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough . 

kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture . 

it stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who , through quite a bit of luck , find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named "" pleasantville . "" 

maguire , as the reserved bud parker , is perfect for the pseudo-world ; but the rebellious mary sue ( witherspoon ) is not at all made for the father-knows-best times . 

it's not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end , and begins to teach the townspeople - in a quite unlikely way - what life is * really * like . 

soon hues of color creep into the black and white world , and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism , others fear the strangeness . 

at one end is a soda shop owner-turned-painter named mr . johnson ( jeff daniels ) and at the other end is a close-minded mayor ( j . t . 

walsh ) and his chamber of commerce ; but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town . 

fine performances are turned in all around . 

maguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads , but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j . t . 

walsh ( in his latest and final posthumous performance ) . 

daniels brings an atmosphere of awe , inspiration , and hope to his character , whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness - almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman's envy . 

for daniels , it's his most commendable performance of the last three years - or more - and for walsh , it's a complementary exclamation point on a fine career . 

also of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen , and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish . 

there's not much to dislike about pleasantville , and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don't . 
"
"since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they're portraying , it's fitting to say that "" beloved "" come as a real shock as a film . 

it's confusing , bizarre , and as tough a film to watch as any film i've seen all year , and that's not necessarily because of the three-hour running time . 

 "" beloved "" is challenging to watch , filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard , and instead of a straight-forward , hollywood-ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed , "" beloved "" comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened ( or , rather , toni morrison , who wrote the novel upon which this is based ) . 

 "" beloved "" tells the story of an ex-slave named sethe , played by oprah winfrey , who lives on a large farm in the north with her children . 

when the film opens , her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist , which shakes things up , wounds the dog , and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family . 

sethe is proud , though , and will not move . 

her sons run away , leaving only her and her daughter , denver ( kimberly elise ) alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation . 

a couple years pass , and the ghost remains , and one day , a man named paul d ( danny glover ) , another ex-slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together , arrives , asking for lodging . 

he has been wandering around since he left the plantation , and when he enters the house , it turns red and becomes incredibly hot . 

when he remarks about what he thinks is evil , sethe replies "" it ain't evil . 

it's just sad . "" 

some more time passes , and paul d has become a fervent member of the household , and the ghost disappears . 

but when they return one day from going out , they discover a young woman sitting in the house . 

her name is beloved , and as played by thandie newton , she has almost zero motor skills . 

she stumbles around , half-grabbing onto things and knocking them over , and when she speaks , she lets out a low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk . 

they let her into her house , and she begins to turn things upside down . 

 "" beloved "" acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story . 

most of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic , low-lit room , with the occasional flash to the past , where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modern-day psychoanalysts . 

sethe and paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation , which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands , with her nipples being licked , prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it , "" they took my milk ! "" 

worst of all was the month after her freedom , when she was allowed to live like a free person , working with other blacks on a farm , and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back . 

she runs to the barn near by , carrying her four children , and when her old owners burst in , they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they don't leave them alone . 

when she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film , she says she doesn't regret it . 

she killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did , and she has convinced herself she did the right thing . 

of course , beloved is really her daugher materialized , though we aren't flat out told that until later on in the film . 

beloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long . 

thus , "" beloved "" becomes a sorta-redux of the andrei tarkofsky sci-fi classic , "" solaris , "" where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife , who commited suicide years before , has materialized when he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system . 

that film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories , how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past , and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us , it would control us completely . 

 "" beloved "" moves along freely , without a lot of explanation , and for the most part , this is extremely respectable . 

the most interesting films are the ones that don't explain everything for us , leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense . 

sethe is never fully explained as a character , but we understand all her actions since she's being played by oprah winfrey . 

it's been well over a decade since her last major performance in "" the color purple , "" but judging from these two films , i'll bet she's one of the best actresses working today . . . if 

she was strictly an actress . 

her talk show , which i suppose is a great entity , has prevented her from becoming a noteworthy actress , and that's a shame because she brings so much to this movie . 

emotion . 

sadness . 

strength . 

watching the strong sethe , who's so afraid of the past that she's built a rather strong protective coating around herself , break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great . 

she makes it real . 

that's not to say this is a perfect film . 

in fact , i'd wager to say that the fact that it's confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is . 

while oprah's performance is powerful and easily sympathetic ( and i'm dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination this february ) , the structure of the film , which doesn't show what happened to her children till halfway through the film , prevents us from really making a cohesive connection to the film . 

it doesn't necessarily move as though they're memories of one particular character , and by the end , it has lost control over sethe , and as she takes to bed , we are unable to truly identify with her anymore . 

but despite its tediousness , perhaps that's the point . 

the distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the start , since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable , and it needs to get back with reality . 

and for the most part , this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it really wants to be . 

jonathan demme's direction is bizarre , in nature with the story , and he creates the right mood , making it a tough film to sit through , making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters . 

there's more to admire here , like the way that the flashbacks pop up freely and without real organization , just like they would be in real life ; and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat open to more pain and suffering , but laced with a touch of optimism . 

the acting , not only from winfrey , is amazing , and i anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination . 

everyone has been raving about thandie newton's performance , and how it should be rewarded . 

however , it must be noted that out of everyone , she had the easiest part . 

act like a baby . 

throw things . 

stumble around . 

chew food with your mouth open . 

i do think there's another performance worthy of oscar conisderation , but it's kimberly elise , as the daugher who has to stay sensible and sane , and has to carry the burden of her mother's loss of reality towards the end . 

it's not that newton isn't great : she's as annoying and wacky as the role demands . 

it's just that elise has the tougher job and pulls it off even better . 

despite the fact that this film has winfrey written all over it , and not that of writer morrison or director demme , "" beloved "" has still not done well . 

costing , i think , around ninety million dollars , it has since grossed about twenty-two . 

unfortunately , this film is a little too intense for viewers , even for me , and i can stand almost anything ( i recently viewed the 2 1/2 hour long epic "" caligula , "" the worst film i have ever seen in my life , and did it in a mere 2 sittings ) . 

although i respect "" beloved , "" i can't say that i really enjoyed it .

"let me just start this review off by saying i am a huge fan of professional wrestling and have been for fifteen years . 

i am not too fond of ted turner's world championship wrestling , however , and i am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie tonight . 

the plot concerns two losers named gordie boggs ( david arquette , aptly cast as a neandrathal ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) who are so obsessed with professional wrestling that they believe everything they see on wcw monday nitro is something more than a flashy show . 

when they finally get to see their hero , wcw world champion jimmy king ( played by oliver platt . 

i personally would have gotten a wrestler to play king ) , he ends up getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair ( a wasted palitaliano , in a role originally meant for real-life wcw president eric bischoff before he was fired and rehired six months later , and if anyone reads this who knows bischoff , they will agree with me that the role of sinclair had his name written all over it ) , they embark on a quest to find him and help him get his title back . 

when they find him , they discover in horror that jimmy king's real life is nothing like it is on wcw tv . 

king is a drunken atlanta native rather than an english king . 

after convincing king that they don't care that his persona isn't real , gordie and sean sneak him back onto wcw monday nitro , after which sinclair agrees to book him in a main event steel cage match for the wcw title and his job back in las vegas at wcw's pay-per-view . 

gee , whiz , there are so many things wrong with this movie , i don't know where to begin . 

yes , i do . . . 

1 . the characters of gordie and sean show you what eric bischoff , wcw president who thought up this project , thinks of wrestling fans . 

he thinks of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do seriously . 

he actually thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough to believe this is meant to be taken seriously . 

i got news for you , eric : nobody above the age of four is dumb enough for that , this is 2000 , you know , not 1985 ! 

i know he'll probably cover arguments up by saying it isn't meant to be taken seriously but it is , because that's how big an ego bischoff has . 

2 . there was a documentary made in 1998 , wrestling with shadows , that documented the owner of the world wrestling federation , vince mcmahon's screwing bret "" the hitman "" hart out of the title . 

this movie's storyline is basically a comic rip-off of that plot with the poor man's wayne and garth thrown in . 

eric bischoff is trying to make vince mcmahon look bad with the character of titus sinclair , but any wrestling fan knows titus is more like bischoff than mcmahon , and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart . 

3 . 

the movie's main wrestler , jimmy king , has an english king gimmick and the audience cheered big for him . 

no wrestling fan actually enjoys characters like that in this day and age , we want bad asses today ! 

4 . why make this a comedy , instead of an emotional , rocky-style drama ? 

i know wrestling isn't a sport , but you can still get behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler and finally makes it in the end . 

5 . 

in the movie , gordie starts up an ill-fated romance with nitro girl sasha ( the lovely rose mcgowan . 

what she sees in that freak marilyn manson i'll never understand ) , only to find that she has hospitalized king's trainer for sinclair . 

wouldn't it have been easier to just have them fall in love instead of doing the typical spy-girl-for-the-bad-guy cliche ? 

i hate that . 

6 . 

last , but certainly not least , there was not one single moment in this movie that i could not predict would happen , nor did i laugh once either . 

the world wrestling federation should have been the wrestling company to make the movie , for these reasons : 

1 . they're the better promotion . 

2 . they have better and younger talent , performers and wrestlers . 

3 . 

they give their fans what they want and don't treat them like idiots . 

4 . they're winning the ratings and they're the promotion everybody cares about . 

5 . simply put , they could make a movie a hundred times better , and they could do a wrestling movie the right way . 

the only good thing about this movie was they played outtakes at the end . 

and if i spoiled it for you , good , i saved you from wasting seven dollars .

" "" we are grateful that we have the songs of grace chan to comfort us . "" 

starring lee kang-sheng , yang kuei-mei directed by tsai ming-liang written by tsai and yang ping-ying cinematography by liao peng-jung 

taiwan , 24/12/99 . 

the millenium approaches . 

an incessant downpour batters an unnamed city . 

sectors of the city are being sealed , quarantined due to the onset of a mysterious virus . 

the virus causes people to act like insects : they crawl about on all fours , hide from bright lights , huddle in damp corners . 

the water supply to the quarantined zones will be cut off in a week's time . 

residents are advised to evacuate the area , asap . 

this premise--kafka by way of cronenberg--is the background for the hole , which could have been a great movie , but , sadly , ends up as a waste of good ideas . 

the quick sketch above suggests a dark , absurd , hallucinatory near-future parable of life in the late 20th century ; in execution , however , it is nothing like that . 

the virus , the evacuation , the visual possiblities of the deluge : these are all relegated to the background . 

instead , the hole focuses on the lives--for want of a better word--of a man ( lee kang-sheng ) and a woman ( yang kuei-mei ) who live in the same apartment building , and who have no personalities . 

the entire movie taks place in settings that are uniformly ugly and sterile : the charmless rooms and corridors of a post-industrial apartment complex , photographed to look as dim and dingy as possible . 

it's a vivid setting , but an unappealing one , especially with the monotonous hiss of falling rain and the gurgle of drainage pipes in the background . 

the man lives in the apartment directly above the woman's . 

one day , a repairman investigating a leak leaves a small hole in the floor of the man's living room , opening into the ceiling of the woman's living room . 

this hole--symbol of the solitary opening in the character's lonely , compartmented lives--allows them to interact in unusual ( and mostly non-verbal ) ways . 

example : the man , suffering from the onset of the virus ( or so i assume--everything is obscure in this movie ) vomits through the hole . 

the woman , wandering around in the dark , accidentally puts her hand on his vomit , and then cleans it up . 

this is what passes for meaningful communication . 

and they say romance is dead . 

much of the film does not even focus on their interactions , such as they are . 

there is almost no dialogue and we learn next to nothing about these people . 

they are ciphers . 

instead , we are treated to long takes in which we witness their miserable lives ; we watch , for instance , as the woman boils some water , pours it onto some noodles , then eats the noodles . 

 ( this is as fascinating as it sounds . ) 

offered as counterpoint--or perhaps relief--to these dreary sequences are a series of musical numbers , fantasies in which the woman lip-synchs to pop songs by grace chan ( popular , so i'm told , in 1950s' china ) . 

she prances around in grimy hallways and grungy stairwells , incronguously lit by cheerfully bright spotlights . 

sometimes , in these fantasies , she is joined by the man . 

these scenes are presumably intended to be bright and fanciful , sharply contrasting the dreariness of reality , but they fail . 

when the man and the woman dance , it seems half-hearted and listless . 

astaire and rogers this is not . 

even in imagination , these people are numb , weary , boring . 

the hole is part of the 'collection 2000' series , a group of films commissioned by french tv station la sept arte on the subject of the millenium . 

others include canada's last night , brazil's midnight , and american hal hartley's the book of life . 

the book of life is the only other one that i have seen , and it is infinitely superior to the taiwanese entry . 

witty , energetic , humane , it makes the the hole seem ( ahem ) empty . 

american movies with nothing to say try to disguise their lack of content with flashy movements , quick cuts , superficial emotions . 

foreign movies with nothing to say do what the hole does : they point the camera at something of minimal interest for unbelievably long periods of time , and call it art . 

the hole is self-evidently a film about alienation , and perhaps director tsai ming-liang wants the audience to share in his characters' alienation . 

if so , he succeeds . 

perhaps it is a challenge : he dares us to enjoy this movie , despite his best attempts to ensure that we don't . 

if it was a challenge , i wasn't up for it . 
"
"about an hour or so into "" the jackal , "" a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence , and one of the audience members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out "" i hope she gets killed now ! "" 

at that point it hit me : i didn't care for any of the characters being played by actors i didn't really like . 

when the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because he's being played by sidney poitier , you know something's rotten in the state of denmark . 

every year , a couple films like this are released . 

you know : the cheap , action packed international espionnage film , featuring a semi-promising premise , some big-name actors ( usually bruce willis ) , and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago . 

this was the third one of '97 , following the very lackluster "" the saint , "" which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe ; and the surprisingly fun "" the peacemaker , "" featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain . 

 "" the jackal "" tries to mix both elements . 

and you thought "" the saint "" was bad . 

 "" the jackal "" is loosely ( very loosely , i hope ) based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that i've yet to see , "" the day of the jackal , "" which featured ( apparently ) a suave hitman called the jackal , played by edward fox , trying to assasinate charles degaule . 

well , welcome to the 90s , where a sorta suave hitman , also called the jackal ( bruce willis ) , trying to kill the head of the fbi . . . or 

is he ? 

after being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother ( killed in the opening scenes ) , the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere , from helsinki to virginia , setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he'll be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion . 

and like the saint , the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people . 

the agent working on the case , cater preston ( sidney poitier - yes , that sidney poitier ) , working with a russian agent , valentina koslova ( diane venora - lady capulet from "" romeo + juliet "" ) , gives up early on and meets with an ex-ira man , declan mulqueen ( richard gere , putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of '97 ) who's in a massachusetts jail , but who has apparently seen the jackal , who has been eluding the law forever . 

soon , he's out working with the two untrusting agents , and trying to help them catch him . 

there are numerous problems with the film , and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on . 

the film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller , but save a couple moments , the film never achieves suspense , or even a sense of intrigue . 

sure , the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense , but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register . 

the film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience , or even an entertaining one . 

it doesn't help that the plot is designed to be complex , but falls into so many problems , like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances . 

the script of "" the jackal "" is a complete mess , mostly because it can't decide what it wants to focus on . 

is this a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer ? 

is it a film about a nasty , amoral hitman who's in everything for the money ? 

or is it a combination of both ? 

 "" the jackal "" aims for the latter , but never focuses in on either character . 

the connection between the two feels completely edited , so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan , you wonder how he recognized him so fast . 

the worst part is the little past they try to give declan , most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend , isabella ( mathilda may ) , given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then . 

the supporting characters are worse . 

sidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role , that of a man who is just stern sometimes , and other times more giving and likable . 

what is poitier doing here ? 

he's one of the best living actors ! 

does he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this ? 

diane venora's russian character is almost as bad , with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth , and a plastered on expressionless facade . 

it's not that anyone's bad here ; it's that they have nothing to do . 

the plot is a joke , feeling like it was pasted together by someone in post-production who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time . 

the jackal himself is not even much of an international villain . 

there are several times where he's in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself , the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill . 

take a scene where he's being followed by some agents into a parking garage : he quickly sprays his car another color , and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it . 

doesn't killing someone attract more attention than it does distract ? 

and does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in a public place ? 

geez ! 

is there anything good here ? 

well . . . a 

couple things . 

i did like willis's icy expressions ; he may not have been real suave or anything , but some of his looks are worth a chuckle . 

richard gere has a couple of good moments , making his character as likable as he possibly could have . 

and a couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous , completely inane but fun kinda way , most notably : a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder ( jack black ) ; and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man , which has its share of a couple good jokes , most particular a kiss by willis . 

but none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go ; they're just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly then toss us back into the world of dullness and stupidity that is "" the jackal . "" 

director michael caton-jones ( who directed the far superior "" rob roy "" ) has made a film that is made very couple months , one that is unentertaining , unintriguing , and pretty much cold , but will nevertheless make money because , hey , the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retro-clancy kinda way . 

every now and then , the filmmakers get it right ( "" clear and present danger , "" which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way ) , but "" the jackal "" is an example of when they go completely wrong . 
"
"ok , let's get one thing straight right away : maximum risk is no battleship potemkin ( although it does have some russians in it ! ) , but it's not too bad , really . 

it's the new film from ringo lam , the latest hong kong filmmaker to defect to hollywood , and stars that minor league schwartzeneggar from belgium , jean-claude van damme ( who , you will recall , also starred in john woo's maiden hollywood effort , hard target ) . 

in lam's film , van damme plays alain moreau , a french cop ( at least his accent makes more sense here than it did in hard target ) who discovers that he was separated shortly after birth from a twin brother who was adopted by russians . 

these russians defected to the united states and moved into a black neighbourhood in new york ( where , i suppose , they thought they wouldn't be noticed ) . 

this brother , mikhail suverov ( played in his few scenes by . . . well , 

you know ) , becomes deeply involved in the russian mafia and the fbi ( almost the same thing , i guess ) , and is killed in france ( in the movie , things happen so fast that you don't have too much time to think about how weird this all is ) . 

moreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do and goes to new york to find out why mikhail was killed , and why everyone in france who knows anything about him is also being killed ( we wonder the same thing ; i still do ) . 

in little odessa , he meets mikhail's girlfriend , alex ( natasha henstridge , last seen in species ) , who helps him solve the mystery and adds immeasurably to the mise-en-scene ( she has very nice breasts , and we get to seen them briefly in this movie ; it was rated r in the us but is pg here , so they must have seen more of her breasts than we do ) . 

this film lacks the gloss and high production values of such other action movies as broken arrow , the fugitive , hard target , or anything starring arnold , but that works to its benefit , i think . 

after all , one thing that's been missing from woo's hollywood films is that certain hong kong funkiness that we all know and love ( well , some of us do ) . 

movies like this shouldn't be too pretentious , and that is part of the problem with some of these other films : they try to be too "" big "" in terms of special effects and sheer spectacle . 

maximum risk has its share of car chases and explosions , but they don't overwhelm the movie or detract our attention from the narrative ( not too much , anyway ) . 

the emphasis throughout is on the characters and their interactions ( even if , at times , they don't make a hell of a lot of sense ) . 

in fact , one of the more interesting aspects of the film is a minor character , a rather overeager new york cabbie ( frank van keeken from tv's "" kids in the hall "" ) , who begins as something of a joke but becomes an important part of the story . 

unfortunately , by the time we have come to really get interested in him , he . . . well , 

you'll see . 

the movie also features some set pieces of the type that we have come to expect from lam and his hong kong compatriots . 

one is a fight in a russian sauna , with lots of sweaty , muscular male flesh ( this one will appeal to certain parts of the audience more than others ) , bullets in heads , and vodka . 

another , my personal favorite , is a fight in a meat packing house , featuring pig carcasses and a chainsaw . 

and even the predictable car chases are more hong kong than hollywood , as they trash those quaint french cafes , vegetable carts , and , well , french people that , we all know in our hearts , deserve trashing just for being so damn quaint . 

of course , the movie does have its share of silliness . 

for example , while beating the crap out of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves what he's getting , alain stops long enough to look at his own reflection in the cracked mirror with which he has been whacking the guy on the head . 

in an unnecessarily dramatic moment , he apparently is shocked at what he sees , at what he has become . 

but what has he become ? 

a tough cop who beats the hell out of a guy who tried to kill him ? 

doesn't sound too unreasonable to me , considering the genre . 

but let's face it , any time van damme tries to be dramatic , he looks silly . 

so maximum risk is a little different from most other action films . 

while watching it , i was surprised , and a little disappointed , in the relative lack of pyrotechnics . 

but watching some of these other action films is sort of like experiencing a sugar rush ; after the initial excitement , there's not much left . 

although it's short on spectacle , lam's film leaves a better and more lasting impression , i think . 

i'm more impressed by it now than i was while watching it , and to me , that's a good sign . 

go see maximum risk , but don't expect a typical hollywood action movie ; expect a sort of funky hong kong-hollywood action movie . 

the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . 

 * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! 

 * * * pretty good , bring a friend . 

 * * * * amazing , potent stuff . 

 * * * * * perfection . 

see it twice .

"certainly no one would rent ed wood's glen or glenda ? 

expecting to see a good movie , but this screwy discourse about transvestitism betrays a level of incompetence that i didn't know was possible . 

in fact , wood's infamous plan 9 from outer space actually seems pretty tame by comparison . 

watching glen or glenda ? 

i found myself occasionally wondering if wood had originally made two or three separate movies and accidentally edited them together ; as a result , it is actually quite entertaining in that it is unintentionally hilarious . 

the movie starts out as what mostly seems like a bad documentary , with endless , repetitive narration about transvestites , how difficult it is for a transvestite to look at his girlfriend's clothes without being able to wear them , how transvestites are not necessarily homosexuals , and how the main character , glen/glenda is ( as it reminds us probably half a dozen times ) "" not half man and half woman , but man and woman at the same time . "" 

the camera work is terrible-occasionally the camera lingers on , say , a closed door while the characters talk off-screen , or inexplicably zooms in on someone's ear or nose . 

wood also makes copious use of mostly irrelevant stock footage , which leads to voiced-over non-sequiturs like , "" yes , our world is a busy and frightening place , with so many people driving their automobiles . "" 

finally , there is occasional commentary from bela lugosi as a sort of omniscient being who seems to inhabit a frankenstein-style laboratory , delivering pointless lines such as , "" people . 

 . 

 . 

all with their own thoughts . 

 . 

 . 

their own ideas . 

 . 

 . 

 . "" 

while lightning crackles quasi-ominously overhead . 

had wood continued in this vein , glen or glenda ? 

probably would have been remembered as nothing more than a poorly done documentary with the occasional inappropriate horror-movie touch . 

unfortunately , he then wanders so far off into left field that you have to wonder if he had been eating some funny mushrooms when he wrote the script . 

 "" pull the string ! 

pull the string ! "" 

announces an alarmed lugosi as stock footage of buffalo appears . 

there is another crash of lightning before lugosi returns , this time warning us , "" beware . 

 . 

 . 

beware the big green dragon that lurks outside your door ! 

 . 

 . 

 . 

it eats little boys . 

 . 

 . 

and puppy dogs' tails . 

 . 

 . 

and big fat snails ! "" 

a bizarre nightmare sequence , which is probably meant to be symbolic but instead is just incredibly stupid , ensues , during which glen/glenda finds his fiance trapped under a fallen tree-in the living room . 

someone who is apparently intended to be the sinister "" green dragon "" ( but looks more like a klingon from the original star trek series ) appears to be orchestrating all this , though the film is far from clear on this point ( to put it kindly ) . 

near the end of this scene-and here i must confess that wood lost me completely-is a violent sexual encounter on a couch that features two characters who do not even appear in the rest of the movie and is scored by goofily upbeat folk music . 

after this scene ends ( not a moment too soon ) , glen or glenda ? 

returns to its documentary style , but at that point any lingering sense that wood had the slightest idea what he was doing is pretty much gone . 

the film wanders to a dumb happy ending that also seems to abandon much of what it was trying to say about transvestitism , but at that point it didn't matter much what happened . 

as soon as the aforementioned sex scene was over , glen or glenda ? 

had pretty much cemented its place in my mind as the most incoherent film i had ever seen . 

i honestly think that if i picked up my camcorder and deliberately tried to make the worst movie i possibly could , it still might not match glen or glenda ? 

for sheer cinematic disaster . 

i am giving this movie an f , but i'm not sure that quite does it justice .

"it's a good thing most animated sci-fi movies come from japan , because "" titan a . e . "" is proof that hollywood doesn't have a clue how to do it . 

i don't know what this film is supposed to be about . 

from what i can tell it's about a young man named kale who's one of the last survivors of earth in the early 31st century who unknowingly possesses the key to saving and re-generating what is left of the human race . 

that's a fine premise for an action-packed sci-fi animated movie , but there's no payoff . 

the story takes the main characters all over the galaxy in their search for a legendary ship that the evil "" dredge "" aliens want to destroy for no apparent reason . 

so in the process we get a lot of spaceship fights , fistfights , blaster fights and more double-crosses than you can shake a stick at . 

there's so much pointless sci-fi banter it's too much to take . 

the galaxy here is a total rip-off of the "" star wars "" universe the creators don't bother filling in the basic details which makes the story confusing , the characters unmotivated and superficial and the plot just plain boring . 

despite the fantastic animation and special effects , it's just not an interesting movie .

"plot : odin is a great high school basketball player . 

he's dating a hot girl and the coach loves his ass . 

in fact , the coach even admits to having fatherly feelings towards him . 

unfortunately , the coach's real son , hugo , isn't too pleased to hear that . 

in fact , he doesn't like hearing about any of odin's triumphs , as they generally supersede his own . 

so what does he set out to do ? 

well , let's just say that he starts to mess with people's heads and one thing leads to another thing which leads to . . . well , 

you'll see . 

critique : a very powerful , thoroughly depressing , well-acted "" non-teen "" movie starring a bunch of teens . 

credit director tim blake nelson for creating a modern day version of this shakespearian classic , set in a realistic high school environment , with the basketball championships as the backdrop and an impending sense of doom as it core . 

you also have to give it up to all of the actors in this film , who turn over some very convincing performances , taking you through all of their characters' ups and downs . 

hartnett especially should be applauded for taking on such a despicable character , a dude who you just want to grab by the throat and beat the shit out of ( sign of a good actor , if you ask me ) . 

phifer also comes to play in this movie , with a nice blend of charisma , fear , love and anger spread over his character . 

i was always on this guy's side and definitely felt sorry for him as things moved along . 

julia stiles was also good , but her character wasn't much different from others that she's played recently . 

i was however very surprised with martin sheen's showing , since i hadn't taken him too seriously as an actor over the past few years . 

his character is definitely over-the-top in this film , but i appreciated his fervor , his rage , his ultimate and blind desire to win above all . 

a great example of a workaholic man who cannot see the trees from the forest . 

i did have a few reservations about the movie though . 

first of all , what was with all of the gangsta hip-hop music used in pretty much every other scene transition ? 

it was cute at first , but became a little too obvious and annoying after a few times . 

the film was also edited pretty choppily . . . like 

some scenes were cut out and no one "" cleaned it up "" afterwards . 

i also didn't like the fact that hartnett's character , the man behind much of the nastiness that goes down in this film , was infallible . 

in other words , pretty much everything he says or asks of someone , happens automatically and without any goofups . 

i mean , i know the guy is smart and all , but i would have appreciated a little more "" realism "" under some of the circumstances . 

but overall , the movie will devastate you . 

it's not a "" fun date movie "" . 

it's not a movie about the high school basketball team and how its black star falls for the white girl from the other side of the tracks . 

it's about jealousy , love , envy , fury , passion , revenge and pretty much any other negative thought that's ever passed through your head . 

is it worth seeing ? 

oh , most definitely ! 

 ( pun intended ) it's a moving picture with great performances , no shakespearian speak ( thank you , god ! ) and an outstanding directorial job by nelson . 

the final scene alone is enough to send a massive chill down your spine , and i was especially impressed with the director's choice of music near the end . 

in fact , the whole sequence was quite reminiscent of the final showdown scene from taxi driver , and i guess that's saying something right there .

"niagara niagara ( r ) bob gosse's niagara niagara follows a blueprint not unlike a lot of young-lovers-on-the-road movies . 

wild marcy ( robin tunney ) and calm seth ( henry thomas ) meet cute , literally running into each other while shoplifting at a local store . 

a mere couple of scenes later , the two embark on a journey to toronto from their small , unnamed american town in pursuit of a rare doll that marcy desperately wants . 

along the way , true love inevitably blossoms . 

what sets niagara niagara apart , though , is that marcy is afflicted with tourette's syndrome , a neurological disorder that causes sudden muscle and vocal tics . 

tunney , displaying an acting range not hinted at in the teenage witch thriller the craft , delivers an astonishing performance that won her the best actress prize at last year's venice film festival . 

to term her work a tour-de-force is not to imply that she attacks the scenery ; tunney's effectiveness lies in her modulation and vulnerability , which makes her depiction of marcy's illness--which often causes her to act violently--that much more convincing and tragic . 

she and the nicely subtle thomas develop a sweetly innocent and beguilingly off-kilter chemistry . 

their journey hits a few rough spots creatively along the way , mostly the fault of writer matthew weiss . 

a detour involving a kindly widower ( michael parks ) who takes the couple in brings the story to a screeching halt , and the key character of a trigger-happy pharmacist ( stephen lang ) is highly unbelievable . 

but these missteps do not blunt the power of tunney's bravura turn , which carries niagara niagara to a level of poignance it would not have otherwise achieved .

"paul verhoeven , the dutch auteur who dragged his violent , sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film , has never been what i'd consider a thoughtful director ( though some of his films , notably starship troopers , have been lauded as artistic achievements ) , but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who's managed to , no matter what the budget , make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils . 

starship troopers was essentially a b-monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange ( a great film that's nearly impossible to find on video , yet showgirls is everywhere ) , in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins ; the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards ( who may actually be 45% silicone ) , in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage . 

it's not a completely successful film , but as a failure it's certainly an interesting ( and mostly entertaining ) one . 

my favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores ; spetters , a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub-culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange ( haven't yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight ) . 

i believe his best hollywood film to be robocop , a bleak super-hero satire with a robotic hero that's as touching as schwarzenegger's in t2 . 

that movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics . 

its violence seemed to be there for a purpose , namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread , not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience . 

there's a jaw-dropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him . 

he tortures the officer by taking glee in his victim's every fearful tic . 

it's a startling moment of barbaric , maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punk-noir . 

in hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won't shut up , he impales a co-worker , drowns another and so on . 

but why ? 

his character is introduced as a smug genius , the kind who's always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear , sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place , though once the character becomes invisible , this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster . 

the kind who just won't die . 

hollow man's protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda ( elizabeth shue , acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm ) and her lover , a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin who's saddled with the film's worst lines ( "" i've lost cohesion again ! "" ) . 

they're a typical aaron spelling couple , good-looking but as vacant as george w . bush's republican national convention speech ( i . e . 

bush referring to clinton ; "" ? ? ? so much promise ? ? ? but to what end ? 

to what end ? "" -- 

this actually got applause ! 

suddenly warren beatty doesn't look so absurd ) . 

the rest of the film's characters are all well past thirty , though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with a series of strained one-liners ; is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywood's new character developing technique ? 

ahh , what a cynical time we live in ? ? ? 

as the picture opens we meet cain ( kevin bacon ) , an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on a top secret ( so top secret the government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentation's ) project with the goal to make invisibility a possibility ( for what purpose is never hinted at ) . 

they've performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine , in a twist worthy of the film's 1950's late show origins , to impulsively experiment on himself . 

caine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his co-workers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead . 

our mad scientist is turned invisible ( after several fx-heavy complications ) , then he inexplicably ( it's hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures , but this is never explored , and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human ? ) 

begins raping , assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases , always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger . 

it grows abundantly clear with each new release that it's verhoeven's films that have become hollow . 

like the rest , this one is cold , heartless , and full of contempt for humanity , but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit , insight and makes no statement other than "" audiences will pay for anything these days "" . 

it's an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level , or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a fun , thrill-a-minute ride . 

verhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care . 

the previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick . 

how can one not have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self ? 

a couple weeks ago , after seeing the trailer , a bunch of friends and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability . 

hollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa , in a serious manner to boot . 

but oh yeah , it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway . 

verhoeven delivers the sleazy "" goods "" , but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner , here it just feels icky and uncomfortable . 

the director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses , caressing their breasts with his lens all while faux-psycho music strains in the background . 

it's plainly obvious that verhoeven isn't exploring voyeurism ( like in the classic peeping tom ) but exploiting it and not even doing that very well . 

it's funny that with all the technology $90 million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show a woman's naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand . 

most vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks . 

in fact it's largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since , by the end , most of his potential victims don infer-red glasses that track his body heat . 

as in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov ( a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre ) , and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked . 

the film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy . 

it happens when a lab assistant ( kim dickens , who looks like she stepped out of playboy ) in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon , suddenly pauses . 

 "" are you looking at me ? "" , she queries , obviously haunted . 

it's a little moment in a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to a plot that should have run its course by 1982 ( the apex of the mad slasher craze ) . 

those special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or i still know what you did last summer . 

and they're the only reason to check out hollow man , preferably as a mid-week bargain rental . 

you've been warned . 

but you probably won't listen , will you ? 

tis' a pity ? ? ?

"if beavis and butthead had a favorite movie , from dusk till dawn would probably be it . 

scripted by quentin tarantino and directed by robert rodriguez ( desperado ) , the movie panders to the very worst in sex and violence -- and is incredibly fun to watch . 

it starts off as a pulp fiction-type crime story , with criminal brothers george clooney and tarantino robbing a convenience store . 

because this is a tarantino movie , however , it's not just a case of pull the gun and take the loot , it's a case of a hole being shot through someone's hand , a man on fire jumping out behind the counter and the entire store blowing up as they drive away . 

the opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie -- everything overdone and nothing as it seems . 

clooney and tarantino bring a hostage to the motel and then hijack an rv with a family in it . 

harvey keitel plays the backslidden ex-preacher and juliette lewis his daughter , whom registered sex-pervert tarantino eyes endlessly . 

you know you're mentally unbalanced when you find lewis the least bit attractive , although she's not nearly as obnoxious as usual in from dusk till dawn . 

the first half of the movie has the criminals and hostages trying to get to and through the mexico border , clooney's strategy involving hiding in the rv shower while lewis is on the toilet . 

it does its trick ; the border guard takes one look at lewis relieving herself and immediately goes blind , never noticing clooney or tarantino . 

once they get to mexico , it's time to wait at the rendezvous point , a topless bar called titty twister where we're once again reminded tarantino wrote the movie as he drinks champagne off the foot of a stripper . 

finally , after about ten minutes of intercut boob shots and clooney forcing keitel and lewis to drink with him , the stripper turns into a vampire . 

soon half the people in the bar are vampires and the other half fall or fight back . 

that's right , we've come all this way to see a vampire movie . 

but like everything else , tarantino takes this age-old genre and twists it to his own ends to produce over-the-top entertainment . 

so we get holy water condom balloons , heads rolling , quadruple impalement on an overturned table and keitel getting bitten by a vampire and announcing he only has a few minutes left before he becomes "" a lap dog of satan . "" 

the from dusk till dawn dialogue is 100% tarantino , hovering between absurd and disgusting ( as when they're entering the nightclub and cheech marin announces the main attractions of the titty twister ) , but always entertaining , and is a huge reason the movie is so much fun to watch instead of being one more second-rate gorefest . 

clooney , keitel and especially tarantino are so over-the-top with their delivery that the dialogue is that much more hilarious , ensuring not one second of from dusk till dawn is taken the least bit seriously . 

stuff like this would be terrible in any other movie , but tarantino and rodriguez know exactly what to do to entertain people , even if there's absolutely no message or meaning to from dusk till dawn . 

pulp fiction had the vulgarity and violence for a reason , but this movie just throws it out for cheap entertainment . 

from dusk till dawn isn't the classic of modern cinema that pf is , but is does prove you can do a good job making a really bad movie .

"if you're debating whether or not to see _breakfast_of_champions_ , ask yourself one simple question : do you want to see nick nolte in lingerie ? 

the only people who would get much enjoyment from alan rudolph's chaotic adaptation of the kurt vonnegut novel is the cross-section of the population with the unhealthy urge to see that unpleasant sight . 

everyone else--and i'm hoping that's most people--would be wise to steer clear of this excrutiatingly unfunny mess . 

actually , though , the sight of nolte in high heels is one of the more amusing things about this muddle , which focuses dwayne hoover ( bruce willis ) , the owner of dwayne hoover's exit 11 motor village in midland city . 

not only is he a huge success as a businessman , he's also something of a celebrity , his face made recognizable by an ongoing series of television commercials . 

with a nice home and family to boot , dwayne appears to have it all the ingredients to be happy--yet he's not . 

his wife celia ( barbara hershey ) is perpetually in a pill-induced haze ; his son george ( lukas haas ) is a flamboyant lounge singer who goes by the stage name "" bunny . "" 

not only that , the environmental protection agency is on dwayne's ass over a building development project . 

it's enough to send dwayne on a nervous breakdown--that is , if he doesn't succeed in blowing his brains out first . 

meanwhile , midland city is about to host a fine arts festival , and the guest of honor is one kilgore trout ( albert finney ) , a writer who is far from the renowned author the festival's organizer ( buck henry ) was led to believe--in fact , he's a penniless hack who writes second-rate sci-fi that appears in porn magazines . 

his trek to midland city is also a spiritual journey , one that reaches its apex after meeting dwayne , who for some reason thinks that trout will hold for him all of life's answers . 

the above is already a longer plot synopsis than i usually give in my reviews , but , ironically , i have barely scratched the surface . 

i haven't yet mentioned wayne hoobler ( omar epps ) , an ex-con with an obsessive admiration for the similarly-named dwayne . 

then there's the matter of francine ( glenne headly ) , dwayne's devoted secretary . 

not to mention dwayne's employee and old friend harry lesabre ( nolte ) , the one with the secret penchant for cross-dressing . 

and so on . 

the film is essentially dwayne's story , but too often rudolph goes on distracting tangents with the eccentric peripheral players that one often wonders what the point is . 

rudolph does arrive at a point ( more on that later ) , but it's blunted and obscured by his hyperactive approach to the material . 

the surreal visual style , complete with printed words flying through the air and into dwayne's ears , is obviously meant to convey a sense of madness , but its bludgeoning nature is likely to make viewers mad . 

the actors are called on to act accordingly , resulting in some of the worst , most overdone work all of them have ever turned in . 

willis fares best of all--but that's because his frozen expression of befuddled bewilderment mirrors that of the audience . 

with such an aggressively outrageous atmosphere for nearly all of its running time , it comes as a shock when things suddenly turn serious , and rudolph tries to make a statement . 

unlike _american_beauty_ ( a film that _breakfast_ resembles in more than a few ways , to its great detriment ) , there isn't any palpably earnest undercurrent that would prepare the audience for the big shift . 

as such , the cartoony characters fail to win a sympathy that needs to be earned ; and the film attempts , to no avail , to reach a profundity that it doesn't deserve . 

vonnegut's original novel is considered a classic , but it had been called unfilmable--the same that was said of hunter s . thompson's _fear_and_loathing_in_las_vegas_ , which was disastrously committed to film last year by terry gilliam . 

with the similar failure of _breakfast_of_champions_ , will hollywood ever learn that books labeled "" unfilmable "" inevitably results in a film that is unwatchable ? 

likely not .

"plot : set in the future , a courier has uploaded some data into a "" hard drive "" that resides in his head , and must now escape the bad guys who are after that very important information . 

since he overloaded his "" hard drive "" , he's also racing against the clock before the information seeps into his brain and kills him . 

critique : incoherent , boring , one-act drivel with no suspense , horribly unbelievable futuristic environment , bad dialogue , career-defining bad acting by keanu reeves and a hilarious ending . 

it's too bad because the premise of the film was interesting , but unfortunately for my friends and i , this movie turned out to be just as bad as everyone had warned us . 

it's one of those films that makes you start laughing half-way through , when you realize that most of the actors in it suck , the location shots are filmed in dark "" junkyard "" type areas which they would like to have us believe to be futuristic ( whatever . . . ) , and all the sets look like . . . . well , 

sets . 

there is also absolutely no arc to this story . 

it basically starts off with keanu uploading info into his brain , and then a bunch of folks chasing him from place to place until a laughable ending puts a stop to the former uneventful proceedings . 

gibson should stick to writing novels and "" x-files "" episodes , since his segue into the paranormal tv series was much more entertaining than any of this garbage . 

some other hilarities of this film include dolph lundgren as some futuristic jesus character whose supposed to kick ass , henry rollins as a pumped-up cyber-doctor or something , and ice-t as some kind of a hobo dude with paint all over his face ( don't ask ) . 

the ending is the funniest with some robot dolphin and a stupid ghost-lady from inside the computer doing some stuff that no one really cares about by that point . 

i'm ashamed to say this film was shot in my hometown of montreal , canada , but sadly enough for us all , it was . 

some of the cyber-travelling special effects were okay ( hence , the 2/10 ) , but overall , it's one of those bad movies that's just funny to watch and cringe at . 

thankfully for keanu , he redeemed his sci-fi career with 1999's the matrix ( 7 . 5/10 ) . 

it's too bad that he has yet to redeem his lack of acting talent . 

little known facts about this film and its stars : as of 1999 , director robert longo never directed another full-feature film . 

hmmm . . . now 

isn't that odd ?

"as we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the middle east at the moment , hollywood doesn't loose the oppertunity to get involved , by telling stories and expressing opinions . 

this film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels , hays hodges ( tommy lee jones ) and terry childers ( samuel l . jackson ) . 

they fought side by side in vietnam , where childers saved hodges' life by shooting an unarmed pow . 

that's against the rules of war but understandable , in this story anyway , under the specific circumstances . 

certainly hodges is not complaining . 

years pass . 

hodges , whose wounds make him unfit for action , gets a law degree and becomes a marine lawyer . 

childers , is now a respected and much-decorated hero that has served his country with his life and sould . 

because of his excellent record , childers is sent to yemen to rescue the american ambassador ( ben kingsley ) , cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops . 

childers does what he has to do : evacuate the family and protect the men under his command . 

after three marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire , he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd . 

more than 80 yemeni men , women , and children are mowed down . 

childers is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on a crowd and murder of unarmed civilians . 

he persuades his old friend hodges to represent him in the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film . 

did childers violate authorized u . s . military rules of engagement ? 

or are there simply no rules in war ? 

the answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious , but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions . 

the murder of 83 "" innocent civilians "" has to result into something greater than a simple trial in the u . s . where is the accusations from the arab leaders ? 

where is the u . n . ? 

the film ends without even telling the most interesting story : what happens on the international arena ? 

this film ( in a way akin to films such as "" a few good men "" ) has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism . 

these accusations are pretty heavy , but also unfair . 

what director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking . 

one of the earliest apparent problems with 'rules of engagement' is its lack of credibility . 

the entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now , but is overdone , contrived and unrealistic - as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to proceed . 

a lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality . 

that is precisely why it's not offensive . 

it is completely unobjective . 

many stories are started and never finished . 

many questions are asked , but never answered . 

a lot of parallels are referring to nothing . 

it seems that neither the director , producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film . 

is it about arab mentality ? 

america's foreign policies ? 

america's role in the world ? 

corruption in the higher circles ? 

it goes on and on . 

it consists of countless stories , but not a definable plot . 

it tries to be everything for everyone and ends up being nothing for no one . 

i think that it is ironic , because director william friedkin's probably most acclaimed film was "" the exorcist "" which had a silly story , but became a rather effective film . 

in this case you have a strong story with many possibilities and the result is a silly film . 

though several scenes bare the mark of professionalism ( such as the impressive battle scenes ) , his latest film does simply not engage . 

i believe that friedklin is a director that is absolutely depended on great scripts and talented producers in order to succeed . 

it's obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore a catastrophe . 

the characters feel designed , unreal , merely shadows , with no life outside the conflict . 

even the actors can not save this film from going under . 

though both jackson and jones act admirably , with performances that are as good as you get with a script like this , it is not something that these great actors can boast of . 

they have roles that they could play blindfolded with their hand on the back . 

jackson is gray and jones uninteresting . 

the rest of the cast , including ben kingsly , blair underwood and guy pearce are simply waiting for their paychecks . 

the time has come for the verdict . 

on the charges of complete lack of objectivity , i find this film guilty . 

on the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking , i find it guilty . 

but on the charges of racism i find this film not guilty , because of it's inconclusive and often silly plot that lacks objectivity everywhere , not only when concerning the arab population . 

i must admit that the film is dangerously near the line of being racially offensive and i do think that screenwriter stephen gaghan went a bit too far , portraying the yemeni people almost as stereotypical hollywood bad-guys . 

this is very sad , since in a time like this it is crucial to not lose objectivity and proclaim the truth . 

however , it is absolutely necessary to remember that the muslim terrorists are responsible for most of the terrorist activity in and outside the united states . 

and that it's not a coincidence that u . s . residents in the middle east , including yemen are on constant maximum alert . 
"
"the king and i , a warner brothers animated , musical feature , recycles the classic story of a woman who challenges the heart of a king , with obvious results . 

when anna ( miranda richardson ) , a british schoolteacher , travels to saim to educate the king's ( martin vidnovic ) children , she learns that the king is treating his people unfairly , and must say something to the greedy ruler . 

meanwhile , the king's prime minister ( ian richardson ) , the stereotypical villain , plots to overthrow the king , taking the throne . 

the last , and most predictable , main subplot deals with the king's son ( allen d . hong ) , and his love for a servant , tuptim ( armi arabe ) , and how he conflicts with his feelings , and the ancient laws of saim . 

not even the lone strong character of anna can save the unbelievably horrible waste of talent , as the king and i's problems could fill the blank pages of a journal . 

i will only note the major difficulties , for it would take pages to elaborate on every detail . 

the screenplay , written by arthur rankin , peter bakalian , jacqeline feather , and david seidler , which is based upon the play written by richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein , has some of the worst dialogue written in a film within recent memory , as every time the obnoxious king would shout , "" etc , etc , etc , "" i would cringe . 

literally . 

speaking of cringing- i did quite a bit of this during the rather short film , which is a classic display of terrible filmmaking . 

besides the repetitive dialogue from the king , on the whole , the songs seem out of place , and unlike the lyrics , are unmagical . 

the sole song which is used cleverly is "" getting to know you , "" which is used as anna shows the children the great outdoors , which they have never been exposed to . 

unlike disney animated features , the king and i's songs don't add to the film , and are as uneffective as could be . 

take the following scenario as an example , as the sheer horror of the king and i's music is at its worst . 

you're being hunted by a dragon ! 

what do you do ! ? 

sing a happy song ! 

martin vidnovic voices the king without effort or emotion- you hear the saying two negatives don't make a positive ? 

believe it ! 

with the terrible dialogue that the king has , along with his awful voice track , the king is completely unbelievable , only shows mild signs of any personality , and the only thing that changes in the king is that he says "" etc . , etc . , etc . , "" more and more as the film progresses . 

no personality at the beginning of the movie , none at the end . 

and where does this character's personality change ? 

hey , i thought anna was supposed to change him ! 

isn't that the whole plot ? 

the prime minister's hideous sidekick ( darrell hammond ) brings his share of cringes as well - oh no ! 

another one of his teeth fell out ! 

hardy-har-har ! 

he is supposed to bring laughs for the kidlets , but even at age five i would have cringed while watching him . 

by the way this review is going , you may think the reasoning for my hate for this film is due to not liking animated films- hence why i hate this movie , because the king and i is a disgrace to animation . 

animated films , such as 1994's the lion king and 1998's the prince of egypt , are among my favorite movies of all time . 

the animation team does design their share of well animated settings , so this makes it easier to take my mind off of the annoying king , until i realize that day and night switch back in fourth within seconds . 

i have not read the play , or seen the oscar winning , 1956 film adaption , but from what i can tell , the screenplay for the 1999 version completely butchers the play , for the king and i is never magical , nor interesting . 

if it wasn't for miranda richardson , who voices anna with feeling , the king and i could earn the title , "" worst movie of the decade . "" 

instead , the king and i will just go down as among the year's worst . 

the bottom line- avoid this movie at all costs . 

not even young children , the target audience in this film , will enjoy it . 

not the slightest bit . 
"
"weighed down by tired plot lines and spielberg's reliance on formulas , _saving private ryan_ is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches . 

there ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics . 

spielberg's greatest strength as a director is the polished , formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story . 

but for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war ( or the holocaust ) this technique backfires , for it creates coherent , comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size , complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken . 

in this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films . 

_saving private ryan_ tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on a "" pr mission "" to pull a young man , ryan ( whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere ) out of combat on the normandy front just after d-day . 

ryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers . 

the search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france . 

there's no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making a great war movie . 

the equipment , uniforms and weapons are superbly done . 

the opening sequence , in which captain miller ( tom hanks ) leads his men onto omaha beach , is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat . 

another pleasing aspect of the film is spielberg's brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences , such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers , the banality of death in combat , the routine foul-ups in the execution of the war , and the cynicism of the troops . 

the technical side of the film is peerless , as always . 

the camera work is magnificent , the pacing perfect , the sets convincing , the directing without flaw . 

hanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance , which was utterly convincing , and the supporting cast was excellent , though ted danson seems a mite out of place as a paratroop colonel . 

yet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events . 

it has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film , or the story fails to convince . 

throughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices ( exception : men are shown burning to death with relative frequency ) . 

for example , we see only one man with guts spilled out on the ground . 

here and there men lose limbs ; in one scene miller is pulling a man to safety , there's an explosion , and miller looks back to see he is only pulling half a man . 

but the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact . 

there are no shoes with only feet in them , no limbs scattered everywhere , no torsos without limbs , no charred corpses , and most importantly , all corpses have heads ( in fairness there are a smattering of wicked head wounds ) . 

the relentless dehumanization of the war , in which even corpses failed to retain any indentity , is soft-pedaled in the film . 

ultimately , _saving private ryan_ bows to both hollywood convention and the unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death in war . 

rather than saying _saving private ryan_ is "" realistic , "" it would be better to describe it as "" having realistic moments . "" 

another aspect of the "" hollywoodization "" of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue and in particular , the lack of swearing . 

anyone familiar with the literature on the behavior of the men during the war , such as fussell's superb _wartime : understanding and behavior in the second world war_ ( which has an extensive discussion on swearing ) , knows that the troops swore fluently and without letup . 

 "" who is this private ryan that we have to die for him ? "" 

asks one infantrymen in the group of eight . 

rendered in wartime demotic , that should have been expressed as "" who is this little pecker that we have to get our dicks shot off for him ? "" 

or some variant thereof . 

conversations should have been literally sprinkled with the "" f "" word , and largely about ( the search for ) food and sex . 

this is all the more inexplicable because the movie already had an "" r "" rating due to violence , so swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to make it a family film . 

however , the most troubling aspect of the film is the spielbergization of the topic . 

the most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg . 

he cannot just cede control to the material ; he has to be bigger than it . 

as if afraid to let the viewer find their own ( perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear ) emotional foothold in the material , spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war a meaning and coherence it never had : the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary ( reminscent of the closing scene from _schindler's list ) , the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close ( every bit as bad as schindler's monologue about how his car , tiepin or ring could have saved another jew ) , quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson , captain miller's last words to private ryan , and an unbelievable storyline in which a prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain . 

that particular subplot is so hokey , so predictable , it nigh on ruins the film . 

nowhere in the film is there a resolute depiction of the meaninglessness , stupidity and waste which characterized the experience of war to the men who actually fought in combat ( imagine if miller had been killed by friendly fire or collateral damage ) . 

because of its failure to mine deeply into the terrible realities of world war ii , _saving private ryan_ can only pan for small truths in the shallows .

"capsule : silly and inane adaptation of gibson's short story , which is nowhere in sight . 

gibson's script only adds insult to injury . 

johnny mnemonic is an awesomely bad movie . 

i say "" awesomely "" because it's one thing to fail , but another thing entirely to fail so completely that even the chances for camp value are sabotaged . 

keanur reeves ( who is terrible ) stars as johnny , an "" information courier "" who can carry dozens of gigabytes of data in his head . 

he is given "" one last job "" ( whenever you are in a movie and you hear those words , run ) , which involves him shoving so much data into his cranium that it could be lethal . 

one of the neater touches that the movie brings in is that the only way he could make such an arrangement work was by ditching all of his childhood memories , but it's only followed up on in a token fashion . 

for his trouble , johnny gets chased by the yakuza , who seem to be the new bad guys in all the high-tech thrillers . 

what's funny is that if you watch gangster movies made * in * japan , there are whole gobs of details about genuine yakuza behavior and ethics , but of course there's no room in this movie for any of that . 

the yakuza are simply used to point guns , wave swords , flaunt tattoos , and grimace menacingly . 

 ( i could go on about how gangsters and criminals of many other ethnicities have gotten thoughtful examinations in the movies -- bound by honor , sugar hill and american me come to mind -- when asians remain perpetually stereotyped . 

but that's another essay . ) 

anyway , johnny runs and eventually winds up in newark . 

why newark ? 

maybe because it was cheaper to fake a future newark than a future new york , that's why . 

there , he meets an assortment of odd characters ( ice-t , dolph lundgren and henry rollins play a whole gallery of weirdos ) . 

the script deals with them with all the depth of pieces of furniture . 

it turns out ( what else ? ) that the data in johnny's head could save a lot of people , but of course johnny only wants it out of his head so it doesn't kill him . 

handled right , this could have been absorbing , but the script manages to mangle any chance of real sympathy for johnny at every opportunity . 

the details about the look and feel of the future are all phoned in from other , better movies -- blade runner and brazil come to mind . 

everything looks run-down and scummy , everyone dresses like they're punk rockers , and videophones are commonplace . 

snore . 

the only really interesting flourish is an extended depiction of the way the internet might work in the future ( complete with vr goggles and feedback gloves ) , but i kept thinking that it was more like what some relatively un-technical fellow would * think * it would look and behave like . 

a hacker of johnny's caliber would be blasting away with one command-line function after another , instead of wasting all this time twiddling with holograms , but of course that's not cinematic . 

whatever . 

what went wrong with this movie ? 

gibson wrote his own screenplay , which i guess is part of the problem : what works as a short story doesn't work in a movie . 

his ear for dialogue is terrible and the plot doesn't advance , it convulses . 

from the script on out , it was probably all downhill . 

renting the movie to make fun of it is sort of pointless ; there's no fun in kicking a wounded dog , is there ?

"you don't have to know poker to like "" rounders , "" but it might help . 

that a great deal of this sharp little drama is set in the back rooms of new york's cardshark underground astoundingly doesn't limit its accessibility , even for those who can't tell royal and straight flushes apart . 

 "" rounders "" ' success , then , is owed to its proficient cast and intriguing portrayal of a world not many viewers will be familiar with . 

the dialogue may be filled with terms that only true players will grasp , but you don't have to speak the language to understand the words - a statement that pretty much sums up the effectiveness of the whole show . 

matt damon , fresh off his "" good will hunting "" hot streak , is perfect for the role of mike mcdermott , a young law student with a tremendous gift for gambling . 

but after losing all of his tuition money in a killer high-stakes match with russian poker aficionado teddy kgb ( john malkovich , deliciously hammy ) , he shifts his focus to scholarly matters , leaving his true area of expertise far , far behind . 

things change , however , when mike's old buddy worm ( edward norton ) re-enters his life - it seems worm , just out of jail , owes a hefty sum to nasty thugs , and is counting on his friend's superlative skills to help him pay off the debt . 

that "" rounders "" ' story quickly molds itself into a conventional , predictable tale of redemption doesn't hinder its potency . 

director john dahl , infamous for his neo-noirs "" red rock west "" and "" the last seduction , "" gets extremely convincing mileage out of the been-there , done-that plot mechanics by trumping up the relationship between mike and worm . 

damon and norton bring so much to their roles that they'd be worth catching even if "" rounders "" ultimately folded , but the movie ups its fascinating ante by contrasting their wildly different ways of winning . 

any sequence where the two men sit at the table together is an unarguable highlight . 

if only the other character interaction was as successful , "" rounders "" might merit consideration when it comes time to number the year's best films . 

current "" it girl "" gretchen mol is sweetly appealing as mike's girlfriend jo , aware and weary of his seedy past , but her scenes with damon number too few to be very effective . 

john turturro's aging mentor and famke janssen's tempting siren , both interesting sketches , are hampered by the same limited screen time . 

and as a wizened judge , the great martin landau makes memorable a role that's mostly a plot device - he's on hand mostly to sort-of save the day and provide a voice for "" rounders "" ' moral . 

that moral , by the way , is "" our destiny chooses us , "" and it's something of a surprise when "" rounders "" supports this solemn proverb by eschewing the conclusion you might expect ; mike does learn from his mistake , but neither the mistake nor the way he learns from it is what it initially appears to be . 

in the end , "" rounders "" sees gambling as less a mere addiction than a potential art form , but the poker itself is only a metaphor for a much larger picture . 

the road to true fulfillment lies within the realization and exercising of your natural passions , the movie espouses , no matter what they might be . 

here , low-rent lowlifes like worm just aren't cut out for the cards . 

screenwriters david levien and brian koppelman entertain and educate in their quest to vividly render a culture that's often generalized by movies ; even complete poker neophytes should cross the line from observers to participants when the movie gets to its concluding game scene . 

inside every adventurous filmgoer , there is a desire to be taken someplace new and exciting , and that's the precise allure of "" rounders . "" 

it ultimately matters not that a few of our tour guides feel partially-realized or that the journey itself is cluttered with sites we've seen before , because the final destination is a satisfying one . 

in the end , "" rounders "" holds a winning hand .

"i feel no hesitation in saying that "" there's something about mary "" is the best film that i will see all year . 

from the moment the credits started to roll at the end of the picture , there was no doubt in my mind that i had seen a masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaining months of 1998 . 

it is that good of a film . 

when gene siskel said this about "" fargo "" only a few months into '96 , i dismissed the notion as ridiculous . 

how could you possibly know that a film is so great that nothing you could possibly see in the future could beat it ? 

but after seeing the farrelly's hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork , i now know what siskel was talking about . 

once in a ( very great ) while , a film comes along that is so daring , so brilliant and simply so enjoyable that at the end , you just want to stand up and cheer . 

and you know , at that instant , that you have just experienced something very special . 

now for the shocker ; "" mary "" is the grossest and most disgusting film i have ever viewed ( "" pink flamingos "" obviously notwithstanding ) . 

the movie is so rude and , i guess , inappropriate in nature that i had a hard time sitting in a theater watching it with my parents ( luckily i had seen it before them , so i could warn the about what they were in for ) . 

forget "" blazing saddles "" , "" animal house "" and even the former king of gross-out comedy , "" monty python's meaning of life "" ; they were all only preludes to the farrelly's assault on the senses . 

in fact , this may even be the funniest film i've ever had the pleasure of seeing ( the only real contender is "" monty python and the holy grail "" ) , and most certainly the most hilarious to come out all decade . 

but as funny as it is , something also has to be said about the overall sweetness of "" mary "" ; it has a huge heart . 

you see , the farrelly's are truly gifted filmmakers . 

they don't just present you with a string of dick and fart jokes ( although there are plenty to go around ) . 

they also , very wisely , add an unbelievable amount of charisma to the main characters and actually have them develop as the story progresses . 

it's funny , though . 

if you just look at an outline of the story , it seems kind of contrived and predictable . 

but believe me , it is anything but . 

ben stiller plays ted , a very shy and clumsy teenage geek who lusts after the school babe , mary ( cameron diaz ) . 

after he sticks up for her retarded brother , warren ( w . 

early brown - the cameraman , believe it or not , from "" scream "" ) , his dreams come true when she invites him to the prom . 

in one of the film's funniest scenes , something goes wrong ( i won't ruin it for those who know nothing about the film ) and ted is unable to face mary ever again . 

jump to the present . 

after years of self-loathing , ted finally hires private detective pat healy ( a suitably slimy matt dillon ) to track her down so he can have one last chance at winning the woman he has loved since high school . 

healy finds that mary is still a full-blown hottie and decides to try and keep her for himself . 

admittingly , the basic story line leaves a little to be desired . 

after all , with a not-really-all-that-funny premise , how can you sustain laughter for nearly two hours ? 

somehow , the farrelly's pull it off . 

the performances here are also right on target . 

as ted , stiller adds just the right amount of clumsy charm to make his character not irritating , as he would normally be , but very lovable . 

and cameron diaz is perfect in her role for obvious reasons , but the actor who really grabs your attention is w . earl brown as mary's brother . 

no other actor has even come close to playing a mentally retarded man with as much natural ease as brown displays here . 

i know he won't be nominated , but this is the guy who should not be counted out when it comes time to hand out the oscar nods in february . 

as good as the actors are , though , it's the directors' movie all the way . 

i guarantee that on almost every other top ten list at the end of the year , you will see the number one space occupied by steven spielberg's wwii epic "" saving private ryan "" . 

and yes , that is a great film worthy of the recognition it has been getting . 

but which is harder ; making a great war film or having your audience laugh so hard that they can't breath for minutes at a time ? 

i'll let you decide that one for yourself , but this critic is sticking to his guns . 

there is just something about "" mary "" . 
"
"ahh yes . 

the teenage romance . 

an attractive young cast is pitted into an unlikely scenario that could only happen in the movies , and in the end , the guy always gets the girl . 

and with the arrival of the breakout hit `she's all that' last year ( followed by a long catalogue of imitators including `10 things i hate about you' and `drive me crazy' ) , the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity . 

along now comes `down to you' . 

the folks at miramax are obviously trying to capitalize on the rabid `she's all that' craze with their latest project , which has the studdly freddie prinze jr . attached and all . 

only `down to you' doesn't have the ? unlikely scenario' mentioned above . 

it is an extraordinarily ordinary romance - a dull , unattractive teen comedy that sticks to the boring game plan that we're accustomed to . 

this is the kind of romance that only giggly 12-year old girls will find convincing . 

in strictly textbook fashion , college sophomore and aspiring chef al ( prinze jr . ) meets freshman artist imogen ( julia stiles ) . 

they hit it off like a couple can only in the movies . 

from here , it's the standard boy-meets-girl , boy-loses-girl , boy-drinks-entire-bottle-of-shampoo-and-may-or-may-not-get-girl-back story . 

the plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of the main characters , who are frequently taking part in activities that . . . . 

well , only happen in the movies . 

fortunately , the cast of `down to you' has a certain appeal . 

freddie prinze jr . and julia stiles are an adorable couple , and when on screen together , they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma that the movie should have centered around . 

zak orth , as the newly realized porn star monk , shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the film's intelligent dialogue . 

rounding out the impressive ensemble of young talent are shawn hatosy ( `the faculty' ) , selma blair ( `cruel intentions' ) and ashton kutcher ( tv's `that 70's shows' ) . 

even the fonz himself - henry winkler , the epitome of teenage angst and nostalgia - has a welcome role as al's dad , the host of the popular cooking program `chef ray' . 

maybe the concept of `down to you' looked good on paper to draw such a crowd . 

as a feature film , however , the finished product is bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to keep the gears from stopping entirely . 

perhaps worst of all , `down to you' is not funny . 

the jokes are drawn from obvious sources and the resulting humor is banal and uninspired . 

the characters on screen , often laughing at each other's goofy/embarrassing antics , seemed far more amused than the audience . 

even the giggly 12-year old girls had grown restless toward the end as they waited impatiently for the formula to run it's course . 

the one mildly clever segment featured winkler and prinze jr . in a fantasy sequence called `cooks' , a `cops' take-off in which the father and son would storm houses and cook a decent meal for ? needy' families ( with the assistance of a fully-armed swat team , of course ) . 

when this is the highlight reel , you know the remaining film could leave something to be desired . 

in order to make a teen comedy work , you've got to have characters that show something by way of depth and identity . 

`10 things i hate about you' actually featured characters who were more than walking flashcards , and the result was refreshing . 

no such luck with `down to you' . 

it's just a textbook romance where , despite absurd circumstances , everything is bound to work out in the end . 

and at the end of the whole clich ? d ordeal , the nicest thing you could possibly say would be ` . . . . 

only in the movies' . 
"
"the only thing worse than watching a bad movie is realizing that the film had a lot of potential and could've been effective . 

such is the case with _urban legend_ , the new horror film from first time director jamie blanks . 

the idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends . 

examples include the killer in the backseat of the car and person getting calls from inside her house . 

the killer wears one of those l . l . bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up , so you can't see the face . 

i guess halloween masks are out of style for psychos these days . 

anyhow , the premise is certainly a nifty one and the opening scene is spooky and atmospheric . 

it's a very good setup that promises more chills to come . 

unfortunately , the film never takes off from there . 

the movie takes place on a peaceful new england college campus . 

like most slasher flicks , this one also centers around a young female main character whose friends are slowly killed off by a knife wielding maniac ( or in this case an axe wielding maniac ) . 

i've always wondered why these killers don't save themselves a lot of time and trouble and just go after the person they ultimately aim to kill . 

after the fine first scene , the movie degenerates into a monotonous series of those annoying you-thought-it-was-the-killer-but-was-just- someone-else scares . 

these are always accompanied by loud bursts of music . 

i guess sudden , sharp music chords are what passes for terror these days . 

the actual killer will attack at about every third music blast . 

the slasher appears , attacks , the victim is eviscerated , and the tedious cycle appears anew . 

false scares should always be used in moderation . 

someone needs to tell director blanks that things like this just aren't as scary as they used to be . 

this movie commits the biggest sin a horror film can commit--it's not frightening . 

remember the horror movie cliches that were so mercilessly mocked in _scream_ and _scream 2_ ? 

this movie still adheres to them . 

tons of illogical moments about ; more than i really have the inclination to list . 

and i don't mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie sense . 

that type of illogical can be fun . 

this film insults your intelligence more times than i care to remember . 

the last 20 minutes especially degenerates into such lunacy that you'll be laughing more than you'll be screaming . 

actually , you won't be screaming at all . 

at its best , the acting can barely be called "" adequate "" and the script could've definitely used a rewrite or two . 

the film still manages to have some strong points . 

the killings are certainly inventive and plentiful enough to satistfy most gore fans . 

there are some intentionally funny moments . 

 ( these were exceeded by the unintentional ones . ) 

the film is well made from a technical standpoint . 

besides the first part , there is also another good scene , a prolonged cat and mouse chase inside a radio station . 

if there had only been more sequences like this , that relied on tautness and suspense rather than loud bursts of music , _urban legend_ might've been worth your money .

"saving private ryan ( dreamworks ) running time : 2 hours 48 minutes . 

starring tom hanks , edward burns , tom sizemore and matt damon directed by steven spielberg already being hailed as the 'greatest war movie ever made , ' saving private ryan is an harrowing , saddening and riveting movie . 

it may not be the greatest war movie in my opinion , but it's certainly one of the best war movies made , and one of the best of 1998 . 

tom hanks stars as a captain who's troop has to find private ryan ( damon ) who has a ticket home because his three brothers have been killed in action . 

action , drama and even some humour occur as the troop journeys through wartime france to find him . 

after the disappointing amistad ( 1997 ) spielberg has returned to form with this excellent movie . 

i'm not the war movie genre biggest fan , but i found this film to be gripping , and very scary , thanks to the excellent cast , direction and terrifying battle scenes . 

tom hanks is superb , straying away from his usually soppy dramatic roles , such as in forrest gump ( 1994 ) . 

this time , he plays the role with gritty realism , and is much better for it . 

occasionally he overacts the sentimentally , but he generally delivers a fine performance . 

edward burns , looking a lot like armageddon's ben affleck , also delivers a top notch performance , moving away from his roles in films such as she's the one ( 1996 ) tom sizemore makes less of an impact , but is still watchable , and matt damon reinforcing his position as one of the finest young actors working today . 

spielberg directs very well , putting the audience right in the heart of the action of the battle scenes . 

and what battle scenes they are ! 

they're truly terrifying , yet the audience cannot drag their eyes away from the screen . 

the battle scenes are filmed with a jerky hand-held camera , and the panic and confusion felt by the soldiers is emphasized by this technique . 

the gore and violence isn't spared either , which body parts flying , and blood spurting . 

this film is certainly not for kids and sensitive adults . 

other factors help saving private ryan be a masterpiece of 90's film making . 

the cinematography is excellent , and the music score by john william's is also superb . 

it is never intrusive , and adds to the drama on-screen . 

but while they are thousands of good things great about private ryan , there's one major flaw that detracts the genius of the film : the writing . 

it is unusually flat , with many of the speeches strangely weak . 

the film never really makes any profound statements . 

this is not a major gripe , as private ryan is a film of action , not words . 

still , the script could of been a lot better . 

thankfully , the actors help partly to rectify the situation with their great delivery of their lines . 

saving private ryan , in the end , is an excellent film , but not the 'greatest war movie' due to it's weak acting . 

this film should be viewed by everyone who has the stomach for it , as it's rewarding and extremely worthwhile . 

it really shouldn't be missed , and dreamworks skg has finally found it's first hit movie .

today the movie studios want to take over my critical review , and somehow persuade you that _armageddon_ , the summer's biggest blockbuster , is a film for everybody .

umm , moving right along . . . 

armageddon also has lots of action , with a capital "" a "" .

this can't be any old thriller--we must have an asteroid , the size of texas head straight for earth ! ! 

and , and , we must have beautiful scenic worldwide shots , like paris , blown up .

the final sequence , where muslims in prostrate worship stand up--in domino fashion--to cheer the victory , filled me with such emotional goo that i wanted to , to , to rip the screen into shreds ! !

okay , kids , what does that spell ? 

seriously , folks . 

any film that could take the indie-films' most valuable talents , and throw it all away with a bruce willis vehicle , a hundred-million dollar budget , but have cheap-o sets and lousy special effects , is , bottom line , living proof that hell exists , and has made a multi-picture deal with universal . 

in the midst of all the action , the terseness , the one-liners , the fake sets , the overall waste of time , i recognized matt malloy playing an underwritten nasa technician ( "" malloy , give me a reading "" ) . 

remember him ? 

he was a principal player in last year's _in the company of men_ , a film that was more powerful , shocking , terrifying , funny , and shocking than _armageddon_ could ever aspire to be . 

_armageddon_ cost over $100 million to make . 

_itcom_ cost a paltry $30 , 000 .

"melvin van peebles' "" sweet sweetback's baadasssss song "" was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement . 

it was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident . 

its violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before . 

in style , content , and how it was conceived and produced , "" sweet sweetback "" was a cinematic revolution , whether or not one agrees with its subject matter . 

van peebles , a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france , built "" sweet sweetback "" from the ground up almost entirely by himself . 

because no studio would dare fund such a film , he was forced to raise all the money himself . 

the movie ended up costing about $500 , 000 , part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby . 

van peebles cut costs by hiring non-union labor and taking on most of the film's responsibilities himself . 

he wrote the script , scored the music , edited and directed the film , as well as starred in the central role . 

he was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck . 

for instance , when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x-rating , van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa , but he also developed a little marketing scheme : he coined the phrases "" rated x by an all-white jury , "" which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film . 

he also printed the phrase on tee-shirts which he had no problem selling . 

the storyline in "" sweet sweetback "" is deceptively simple . 

it takes place in los angeles , and van peebles stars as the title character , a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel , and makes money by doing what he does best : having sex . 

one day , he agrees to go with a couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like they're bringing in suspects on a politically-charged case involving murder . 

however , on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mu-mu ( hubert scales ) , who they proceed to beat viciously . 

acting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation , sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death . 

the rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico . 

although the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film , this plot allows van peebles' camera to roam the darker side of l . a . - the ghettos , alleys , and back-street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked . 

van peebles' entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored . 

at the beginning of "" sweet sweetback , "" he offers this epigraph , which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news : "" sire , these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented , but a hymn from the mouth of reality . . . "" 

van peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality , not of exaggeration . 

of course , with today's abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner-city life , as well as films by spike lee , john singleton , and the hughes brothers , "" sweet sweetback "" doesn't seem all that revolutionary . 

it is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made . 

at that time , "" sweet sweetback "" was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it . 

distributors were petrified of a film that , in van peebles' words , gave the black audience "" a chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out - about rising out of the mud and kicking ass . "" 

of course , once it caught on , it caught on big . 

 "" sweet sweetback "" is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era , although van peebles disassociates "" sweetback "" from other movies like "" shaft "" ( 1972 ) and "" the mack "" ( 1973 ) , because those were financed by big hollywood studios . 

 "" sweet sweetback "" is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers . 

however , even if when viewed from an african-american perspective , "" sweet sweetback "" is certainly not without its controversies . 

when it was first released , an article was published in "" ebony "" magazine denouncing the film , while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it . 

there have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all - beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of . 

others have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film ; he has no political motivations , and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs , but in personal and selfish motives . 

still others point to the clich ? black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex , illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm . 

nevertheless , a movie like "" sweet sweetback "" cannot be made without conflicting points of view . 

it is a revolutionary movie not because it's about one man's defiance , but because it put front-and-center black issues that had never been dealt with before . 

until that point , american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain , and with the exception of sidney poitier , all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites . 

the fact that "" sweet sweetback "" was a movie by black about blacks , was something new ( in the opening credits , van peebles lists the starring actors as simply "" the black community "" ) . 

van peebles tells an interesting story that goes a long way toward defining the difference between "" sweet sweetback "" and all movies that had come before it . 

when the movie first opened , he saw it in a theater next to an older woman . 

near the end of the film , when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert , she kept saying to herself , "" oh lord , let him die . 

don't let them kill him . 

let him die on his own . "" 

it was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any african-american in a movie who rebelled against white authority , that she couldn't even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape . 

and , of course , sweetback does escape , and the screen fills with the message : "" watch out ! 

a baad asssss nigger is coming back to collect some dues . "" 

beyond the political aspects , "" sweet sweetback "" is an entertaining picture , which van peebles always intended it to be . 

he squeezed every drop out of his limited budget , and produced a film that , although dated now , was technically fantastic at the time . 

he shot in rough , documentary-like fashion , while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him . 

he makes good use of older techniques like split screens , freeze frames , reversed color schemes , and overlapping images . 

the only time the film ever looks bad is during the night sequences , because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment . 

watching "" sweet sweetback "" more than twenty-five years after its initial release , one realizes that it still has bite . 

arguments can be made that race relations in the united states have made quantum leaps since the early seventies , but there are still problems that are reflected in this film . 

but there is more to the film than its racial aspect . 

the legacy of "" sweet sweetback's baadasssss song "" is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the african-american perspective , but more importantly , the work of every artist who has fought to fund and produce that which is important to him .

i know that is very sweeping statement , so i'll qualify it by adding that the andromeda strain is one of the few films made that genuinely deserve the label of "" science fiction , "" stories in which speculative science is at the core of the plot . 

2001 : a space odyssey is probably a better film , but it really only qualifies as science fiction if you consider metaphysics to be a science . 

most all other films we normally classify as science fiction , or sf , are really just fantasy , action or horror stories set in a futuristic setting . 

the andromeda strain starts out with two soldiers in a high-tech ( for 1970 ) van looking for a crashed satellite in a tiny new mexico town . 

something bad happens to them . 

pictures from a reconnaissance plane show a shocking sight . 

apparently everyone in the town is dead . 

the authorities call a "" wildfire alert , "" summoning four scientists , all but one of them somewhat reluctant , to a super-secret underground germ warfare laboratory in nevada . 

two of scientists , stone and hall , fly directly to the town in space suits and find a town where almost every single resident literally dropped in their tracks , their blood turned to powder in their veins . 

some went insane before they died and two of them , a baby and an old wino , are miraculously still alive . 

they take the survivors and the satellite back to the lab , where stone pressures the white house to call up a "" directive 712 , "" an executive order to cauterize the area around the town with a nuclear bomb . 

what they find on the satellite when they get back to the lab is andromeda , an organism that defies all the normal rules of earth-like life and mutates as it grows . 

their only hope to cure it is to find out what a perfectly healthy baby boy has in common with an old derelict . 

what they find out is that organism feeds directly on energy and that detonating the a-bomb over the town would only spread it across the entire planet . 

they barely call off the bombing in time . 

but then the organism mutates into something that threatens to eat through the labs defenses and break out . 

this triggers the lab's last-ditch defense mechanism , an atomic bomb . 

to those raised on the brainless action fare that pollutes movie theaters these days , the andromeda strain will probably seem interminably slow . 

much of the film is a lot of people standing around looking at video screens and computer readouts . 

but what the characters see on those screens ratchets up the tension with every turn of the screw . 

the performances are universally fine , with the actors keeping things low-key and restrained , just like scientists . 

to me , the real appeal of this film is the fact that it shows scientists acting like scientists and makes it seem exciting . 

we follow the logic of their deduction step by methodical step , puzzling like they do every time andromeda behaves in a way we don't expect . 

this film is only available on wide screen on dvd and that is the way to see it . 

it was originally rated g when first released but it now carries the pg rating , mostly for very mild nudity and one scene in which a body's wrist is slashed , spilling its powdered blood .

" "" when it's cold , molecules aren't moving . 

everything is clean . "" 

these are the essential words of mikey carver ( elijah wood ) , a young teenage boy living in 1973 new canaan , connecticut in the ice storm . 

when mikey delivers these words to a bored science class , it is unlikely that anyone realizes how much they parallel mikey's life and the lives that surround him . 

his father jim ( jamey sheridan ) is rarely seen and his mother janey ( sigourney weaver ) is having an affair with married neighbor ben hood ( kevin kline ) . 

ben's wife elena ( joan allen ) suspects the affair , but doesn't say anything . 

meanwhile , ben's 14-year-old daughter wendy ( christina ricci ) continuously lures mikey and his younger brother sandy ( adam hann-byrd ) into sexual explorations . 

tobey maguire plays paul hood , the 16-year-old narrator of the story who also happens to be the least prevalent character . 

we start the film with an interesting outlook on family from paul . 

he compares family to the fantastic four comic book , and even goes so far as to say that family is everybody's own anti-matter ; something everybody will return to eventually , and the farther you go , the deeper you'll return . 

the ice storm is a character piece that explores a dismal time both in america , and in the individual lives portrayed in the movie . 

everything parallels everything else . 

the young teenagers trying to discover who they are thru drugs , sex , and alcohol is really almost identical to the parents trying to figure out the purpose in their own lives using the same methods . 

 "" when it's cold outside , the molecules aren't moving . 

everything is clean . "" 

everything is clean because nobody will admit what's going on . 

even the president is on tv denying his wrong-doings . 

how can you expect anything more out of a couple of suburban families riding the coattails of sexual revolution ? 

all the sex and drugs is so obviously empty , and i think that's the point of the film . 

at first viewing , the entire movie might seem empty , but then why shouldn't it parallel itself ? 

you don't get to know the characters very deeply , but i think that's because nobody in the movie knows each other either . 

we sadly watch two families go about their lives nearly oblivious to one another . 

at first glance , you might think emotion is lost in the ending scenes because you haven't gotten to know the characters well enough to sympathize - then you realize that just might be the point , and then you do feel the pain . 

the acting by all is quite good , but i particularly liked elijah wood . 

he doesn't seem to be receiving as much recognition as the others , but i still found him to possess quite a real sense of being . 

christina ricci is being acclaimed for her part as the misguided teenage temptress who looks for something more to her life in the pants of every available boy . 

still , i say hats off remain to wood , joan allen's subtle but believable performance as a lonely , unappreciated wife , and the always excellent kevin kline . 

tobey maguire did a fine job , but his character which , perhaps , was the most intact , sensible person in the story , seemed a little lost . 

he was needed , but perhaps he should've been used more . 

the ice storm is being hailed by many as one of the best films of the year . 

i hate to say that i don't agree , but i don't . 

in fact , i can think of many other films that i would rank higher than this one . 

even so , it is a very good film . 

it takes a lot of retrospect to fully appreciate it's art , but when you finally start seeing things in it that you didn't before , you start to grow even fonder of the characters and the story . 

perhaps this is one to see , ponder , and then watch again with different eyes . 
"
"in the continuation of warner brother's franchise , joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow . 

what makes this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film . 

avika goldsman's screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another . 

this coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project as "" the client "" is such a shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke . 

situations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another . 

this is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstone's batgirl , who just happens to be alfred's niece . 

the story of dr . victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought . 

while working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife , dr . freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure , and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment . 

now of course he has become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live . 

now the logic of that little sub-plot escapes me . 

if mr . freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death , why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth . 

this is indeed a cold hearted man . 

the development of poison ivy is no less contradictory . 

she wants to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal . 

she joins with mr . freeze in his plan to start a new ice age , destroying all animal life , therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them . 

the characters have no logic . 

batman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films . 

now that he has an adoptive son in burt ward / robin , bruce wayne is trying to be a father figure , constantly spouting out homilies about family and relationships , while at the same time not really having any . 

george clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the dialogue given him . 

to say that his performance is workman-like is to be generous . 

his best performances are still on "" e . r . "" . 

bruce wayne has the most unromantic evening with his girlfriend ( played by elle macpherson ) , that it brings into question bruce's latent homosexuality . 

there is no spark and no passion ( as there was for nicole kidman's psychologist in "" batman forever "" ) between bruce and anyone other than alfred . 

and even that relationship is very reserved . 

robin comes off less charismatic that in the last film in the series . 

now he's just a spoiled kid . 

in "" batman forever "" , burt ward wanted to be batman's partner and friend . 

now , robin is suffering from ego deficiency . 

robin's attraction for poison ivy is not believable , except for a boy around the age of 15 . 

his later flirtation with batgirl smacks of incest , even though they are not related in a traditional sense . 

chris o'donnell , once considered a rising star , successfully burns up on reentry with this performance . 

his robin needs nothing more than a good spanking . 

the less said about alicia silverstone's performance the better . 

this talented young actress reads her lines with all the aplomb of a dubbing actor for a godzilla film . 

she was cast strictly for her commercial value and she knew it . 

this brings us to the villains . 

arnold scharzenegger walks through his part with all the concern of someone waiting for payday . 

the most rediculous scene is during mr . freeze's imprisonment . 

the guards are at least a foot taller that arnold and yet fall at his hand in one of the most unbelievable fights scenes caught on film . 

it's almost as ludicrous as seeing michael jackson as a gang member . 

umu thurman struts and coos her way through her part , showing a growing discomfort with her sex symbol status . 

her poison ivy has all the come hither sex appeal of may west in "" sextette "" ( 1978 ) . 

the only performances worthy of notice are pat hingle and michael gough . 

these two seasoned veterans carry their scenes with a dignity sorely lacking from the rest of the film . 

without going through the intricacies of the plot , there is one question that always comes to mind with this series ( except for the first "" batman "" ) , and that is how do these super villains manage to hire so many thugs only to abandon them at the final reel . 

mr . freeze is introduced with a team of hockey playing hoodlums that seem to have stepped out of an old kiss music video . 

every villain ( even the minor ones ) have to have a look , no one can be an individual with day glow paint on their face or some sort of elaborate costume . 

with this film , warner brothers has succeeded in retrograding the series back to it's tv incarnation . 

the only thing missing from the action scenes are the superimposed titles detailing the pows ! , 

gwaaaa's , and clang's associated with the old series . 

you almost wonder if william dozier , producer of the tv series is collecting royalties from this film . 

the special effects ( by john dykstra ) and production design ( by barbara ling ) are the primary stars of this film . 

and it is a case of extravagance in the pursuit of nothing . 

every set , from ivy's lair , the batcave , to freeze's hideout is set with enough neon and fiberglass to keep the epa in paperwork for years to come . 

there is no one realistic set or set piece in the film . 

everything is set for maximum exposure . 

the special effects have that strange cartoon look that most rushed cgi effects have . 

there are homage thrown in by dykstra and his team to gene warren and his work on "" the time machine "" ( the growing plant scene ) but these scenes are so wroth with glaring color and art that they are almost obscured . 

joel schumacher has directed the film with no flair . 

camera angles are poorly chosen rehashing set ups from the old tv series . 

master shots pepper the action scenes , destroying any flow of kinetic quality they may have had . 

mr . schumacher is a good director . 

one just has to look back on the films "" the lost boys "" , "" cousins "" ( an underrated film ) and "" the client "" to know that . 

but "" batman and robin "" comes off as a mated made for tv movie . 

the film has no style of individuality . 

it is the cinematic equivalent to jell-o , pretty to look at , but empty . 

it is unfortunate that this film , even with it's surprisingly strong box office has succeeded in doing what warner's thought tim burton would do with the franchise . 

kill it . 

joel schumacher's "" batman & robin "" is loud , colorful , action packed , and ultimately . . 

boring .

"wyatt earp details thirty-five years in the life of same from around 1865 to 1900 . 

after seeing the movie speed twice recently , i kept thinking that i was seeing wyatt's life pass before my eyes in real time . 

this movie was boring , slow , boring , and slow . 

there were a few scenes that tried to be great scenes that tried too hard and just fell flat . 

the script happily woman-bashes but also tries to sound like an 80s movie . 

they cannot have it both ways . 

 "" i now pronounce you husband and wife . "" 

sure , they said that in the 1800s . 

 "" entrepreneur . "" 

sure . 

every bit of male-ego-stroking dialogue that wyatt's third wife speaks to him made me sick to listen to it . 

 "" oh , the script was written by two men ? "" 

 "" no kidding ! "" 

the movie is torture to sit through . 

the scenery is boring . 

the fades were either awkward or cliche or to self important . 

can you say poor editing ? 

everyone looks ugly in this movie . 

when you shoot people from under their chins , they look like they have double chins . 

kevin costner has never looked worse . 

he should sue . 

he looks like he gained the 43 pounds that dennis quaid lost . 

dennis quaid is marvelous . 

if you have to see this movie just for his performance , go into the theatre at the movie's halfway mark . 

doc holliday ( quaid's character ) shows up at about the 90-minute mark . 

gene hackman is very good . 

is he in the credits ? 

i don't remember seeing his name . 

mare winningham makes the best of a small role as wyatt's second wife . 

annabeth gish is good as wyatt's first wife . 

i though that jamie gertz played wyatt's third wife , but i later heard that her name is joanna going . 

she looks great but her dialogue sucks . 

she also seems way to young for costner . 

costner seems way to old for 90% of this movie . 

in his first scene he is supposed to be about 19 years old . 

yeah , right . 

catherine o'hara and jobeth williams are always good and totally wasted here . 

this is the worst movie that i have seen in years . 

the last action hero was better that this . 

go see maverick if you want to see a western . 

bullets for dennis quaid's performance only .

"deep rising is one of "" those "" movies . 

the kind of movie which serves no purpose except to entertain us . 

it does not ask us to think about important questions like life on other planets or the possibility that there is no god . . . screw that , it says boldly , let's see some computer generated monsters rip into , decapitate and generally cause irreparable booboos to a bunch of little known actors . 

heh ! 

them wacky monsters , gotta love 'em . 

of course , since we can rent about a thousand b movies with the same kind of story , hollywood must give that little extra "" oumph "" to get people in theaters . 

that is where deep rising fails , which is a good thing . 

confused ? 

let me explain : 

despite all them flashy effects and big explosions , deep rising is still , at heart , a good 'ol b movie . 

luckily , it's a very good b movie . 

the worst cliches in movie history are a b movie's bread and butter . 

therefore , things that would destroy a serious movie actually help us have a good time while watching a movie of lower calibre . 

of course we know there's a big slimy creature behind that door , that one person will wander off to be picked off by said monster and we always know which persons or person will make it out alive . 

we just don't know when or how horrible it will be . 

i went to see deep rising with my expections low and my tolerance for bad dialogue high . 

imagine my surprise when i discover that deep rising is actually , well , pretty darn funny at times . 

a funny b movie ? 

well , that's new . 

these flicks are not supposed to make us laugh . 

 ( except for a few unintended laughs once a while . ) 

and before you know it , treat williams , wes studi and famke jansen appear on the big screen . 

hey ! i know them guys ( and gal ) from a couple of other movies . 

cool . 

familiar faces . 

so far so good . 

our man treat is the hero , he'll live . 

wes is a staple of b movies , he is the token victim . 

we know he'll buy the farm but he will take a few creeps with him on the way out . 

famke is the babe , 'nuff said . 

there is also a guy with glasses ( the guy with glasses always dies ) a black person ( b movie buffs know that the black guy always dies , never fails ) and a very funny , nerdy guy . 

 ( ah ! 

comic relief . 

how can we possibly explain having to kill him . . . let 

him live . ) 

after the first fifteen minutes i felt right at home . 

i know who to root for and who i need to boo too and a gum to chew . 

 ( please kill me . ) 

suffice it to say that for the next hour and a half i jumped out of my seat a few times , went "" ewwww "" about a dozen times and nearly had an orgasm over all the explosions and firepower our heroes were packing . 

i'm a man , we nottice these things . 

all in all , i'd recommend deep rising if you are looking for a good time and care to leave your brain at the door . . . but 

bring your sense of humor and excitement in with you . 

the acting is decent , the effects top rate . 

how to best describe it ? 

put together the jet ski scene from hard rain , the bug attacks from starship troopers , a couple of james bond like stunts and all those scenes from friday the thirteenth and freddy where you keep screaming "" don't go there , he's behind you "" and you end up with deep rising . 

for creepy crawly goodness , tight t-shirts , major firepower and the need to go to the bathroom every fifteen minutes from seing all that water . 
"
"an unhappy italian housewife , a lonely waiter , a goofy masseuse , lots of love , and gorgeous scenery all come together in bread and tulips , which proves charming despite its covering of predictable , well-worn material . 

the story concerns the aforementioned housewife , rosalba barletta ( licia maglietta ) who accidentally becomes separated from her immediate family while on vacation . 

instead of waiting for a ride home , rosalba opts not to go home to her italian town , but to instead hitchhike to venice . 

upon arriving , she tells her self-centered husband , mimmo ( an excellent antonio catania ) that she'll be home in a few days . 

of course , that doesn't happen , as rosalba quickly gains a level of independence that has been unattainable in her past life of scrubbing floors and buying groceries . 

in what seems like days , she moves in with lonely , suicidal waiter fernando ( bruno ganz ) , gets a job as a florist , learns the accordion , and befriends her neighbor -- a wacky holistic masseuse named grazia ( marina massironi ) . 

rosalba , who is first seen wearing a gaudy stretch pants outfit , starts wearing sexy dresses and getting closer to fernando . 

i can think of at least five other ( american ) movies ( including fried green tomatoes and an unmarried woman ) that are more than similar to bread and tulips . 

but maglietta and ganz , who act with restraint and care , help bread and tulips from becoming a tired retread . 

ganz plays the suicidal waiter role with a solemn , sometimes playful dignity that is a joy to watch , while maglietta never overreacts to her growing comfort with the outside world . 

throughout the movie , maglietta has an easygoing , confident demeanor , which makes it very easy to root for her and her growing attraction for ganz's character . 

the gorgeous scenery of moonlit town squares and sparkling rivers provides a perfect love story backdrop -- you just might want to ask the attractive stranger in the seat behind you for coffee after the lights come up . 

director and co-writer silvio soldini must get credit for sprinkling the movie with effective goofy humor . 

the cheap mimmo , desperate to find his wife ( after all , he needs his shirts ironed and his mistress won't do it ) , hires a job applicant ( giuseppe battiston ) at his bathroom supply firm to do the job . 

the reason ? 

mimmo discovers that the prospective plumber loves detective stories . 

the novice detective's various misfortunes , including him saying goodbye to his weepy mother , are very funny . 

unfortunately , there are flaws that somewhat spoil bread and tulips' cheery tone . 

rosalba is bothered by several surreal dreams during her time in venice , which bring the movie to a halt . 

it's like putting a gunfight in a nora ephron movie . 

several details in fernando's life also never get proper closure , including his suicidal tendencies . 

early in the movie , he nearly hangs himself before rosalba knocks on his apartment door . 

after that , fernando's step towards death is never made reference to , probably because soldini wanted to include a lukewarm , underdeveloped subplot about fernando's stormy past . 

it seems more like a desperate attempt to pump up the drama in a plot that doesn't need any . 

but there aren't a lot of overwhelming negatives in bread and tulips . 

the movie is fun and romantic , with beautiful scenery and characters whose lives we'd like to live if we had the nerve . . . 

or if our passports weren't missing . 
"
"1 . he doesn't have a hard-to-decipher accent , 2 . he doesn't always speak in a monotone , and 3 . 

his face doesn't always wear the same impassive expression . 

in short , the former nfl player turned fox sportscaster turned actor is too good to be bad , but too bad to be good . 

unfortunately , the same cannot be said of his first star vehicle , firestorm , which is just plain awful . 

one of the most glaring problems with long ( who made his acting debut in john woo's broken arrow ) is that he's so mediocre that he often blends in with the scenery . 

as ace firefighter jesse graves , long is supposed to be playing a bigger-than-life action hero -- the kind of he- man who will crash through a flaming door to save a child or parachute into a burning clearing to rescue some stupid campers . 

unfortunately , despite the best efforts of first-time director dean semler to photograph long using heroic shots that make kevin costner's work in the postman look stark , jesse turns out to be a pretty boring good guy . 

to put it kindly , this is not a well-written motion picture . 

firestorm is a collection of howlingly bad lines set against a backdrop of disaster movie clich ? s which , taken together , form something that requires a level of viewer inebriation to be recognized as a plot . 

the only reason this film is getting one star ( instead of something lower ) is that most of the fire sequences are realistic , and i was fascinated by the meticulous planning that must have been necessary to stage them effectively . 

we're introduced to our big burly hero one afternoon when he and some colleagues jump into the midst of a forest fire to save a group of people . 

during this sequence , our big burly hero proves that he's also a sensitive guy by risking his life to save a little girl and her dog ( yes , the dog lives ) from being broiled alive . 

flash-forward a year . 

now , our big burly hero is taking over as chief of his smokejumpers association , replacing outgoing honcho wynt perkins ( real actor scott glenn ) . 

but this day , our big burly hero's first in charge , isn't going to be business-as-usual . 

a group of nasty escaped criminals have set a wyoming forest alight to aid their flight to freedom . 

led by randy earl shaye ( william forsythe ) , the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , they pose as canadian firefighters who somehow got lost across the border . 

along the way , they meet and take hostage the damsel in distress ( suzy amis ) . 

eventually , our big burly hero is placed in a position where he has to fight the fire , rescue the damsel in distress , defeat the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , and restore order to the galaxy . 

firestorm's director , dean semler , is a former cinematographer ( he won an academy award for his work on dances with wolves ) , so it's no surprise that the film looks good . 

unfortunately , that's firestorm's lone asset , and it falters near the end , when computer-generated special effects fill up the screen . 

these are of about equal quality to what you might observe on a nintendo 64 video game . 

the action sequences , which include a variety of chases , are occasionally interesting , but never invigorating . 

everyone , including long , appears to be going through the motions . 

there isn't a memorable performance to be found from beginning to end , unless you count the forest fire , which generates some heat . 

as the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , william forsythe lacks panache . 

he's worse than a generic bad guy ; he's a boring generic bad guy who doesn't have any snappy one-liners to hurl at our big burly hero . 

my advice to scott glenn ( absolute power ) and suzy amis ( titanic ) is to accidentally forget this film the next time they're making out a resume . 

there's some small comfort in knowing this early in the year that i already have one entry for my bottom 10 list . 

 ( at least i hope there aren't 10 worse films than this . ) 

and i know i wasn't the only one who really disliked this movie . 

as the audience was filing out of the screening , i loitered in the theater lobby to catch a few comments . 

the general consensus seemed to be that , although the movie sucked , the promotional key ring was cool . 

the problem is that fox won't be giving out key rings to regular movie-goers , so that nixes any reason to see firestorm . 
"
"a month ago i wrote that speed 2 was the worst film i've ever reviewed on paper . 

i didn't know at the time that i'd soon encounter and despise batman & robin , which has just overtaken speed 2 as the picture least worthy of your attention this summer . 

as directed by joel schumacher ( who now specializes in batman sequels and john grisham adaptations and isn't very good at either ) , b & r is one long excuse for a taco bell promotion . 

the plot , which has mr . freeze and poison ivy ( uma thurman ) planning to take over gotham city and then "" the vorld "" ( as an oddly ineffective schwarzenegger states ) , is weighted down by repetitive asides about the nature of trust , partnership , blah , blah , blah . 

but morals are not the point of this film--topping each bloated , confusing action scene with next one is . 

the garish art direction and overlit cinematography make this picture oddly comparable to the trashy showgirls . 

since when did gotham city become a giant las vegas hotel ? 

only george clooney comes out on top ; he underplays nicely and pretends like he's in a real movie . 
"
"a film that means well , but is too pushy in promoting its belabored point and too sentimental to be compelling as a drama . 

it's jeroen krabb ? 's melodrama about a community of jews in antwerp in 1972 who can't forget their bitter past . 

the heroine is an attractive , carefree , nonreligious 20-year-old , chaja ( fraser ) , who wants to forget her jewish roots by getting involved in student demonstrations , screwing a student rebel leader , and living with her gentile friends away from her nagging mother ( s ? gebrecht ) and her self-absorbed , eccentric father ( schell ) . 

her parents are survivors of the holocaust concentration camps , and her home life is filled with angst . 

her mother is in denial about the past always busying herself by cooking soup and baking cakes and complaining about everything , while her father is more openly loving but has recently been absorbed in searching for two suitcases filled with mementos , a family album , silverware , and his old violin . 

he buried them in a garden during the war while fleeing the nazis , but can't locate them now due to all the changes in the city . 

out of frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher and facing eviction from her apartment , she reluctantly accepts a job as a nanny with an hasidic couple that an old man in her parents' apartment building , mr . apfelschnitt ( topol ) , tells her about . 

the hasidics are ultra-orthodox : they don't go to the cinema or watch tv , adhere to strict dress codes , and strictly observe their religious laws . 

chaja is at first put off by the way they expect her to follow their rules , but soon finds the wife , mrs . kalman ( rossellini ) , to be kind and she becomes attached to one of her 5 children , a 4-year-old named simcha ( monty ) who doesn't talk . 

the stern mr . kalman ( krabb ? ) is not friendly to her and considers her to be a whore because of the way she dresses . 

to hammer home the point of how anti-semitism hasn't gone away there's a barrage of overdone and uninvolving scenes with a sneering concierge ( bradley ) , who keeps making nasty remarks about jews and tries to make things inconvenient for them by preventing the jewish family from using the elevator . 

the film is done in by its ham-fisted script as the story , adapted from carl friedman's book "" the shovel and the loom , "" goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality . 

it starts off telling chaja's story of how she's a lost jewess trying to find her identity , then to her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck in an insulated environment , and then it makes it a story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that can't be forgotten . 

the effort seemed heavy-handed , as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters . 

the supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a cartoonish flavoring : chaja's parents are given no human shades , while the janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was one-dimensional and falsely acted . 

the only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser , whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt -- but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots ; while rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence , but is strong in accepting her faith . 

topol's reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser , acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense . 

the film brazenly uses little simcha to get across its agenda of pointing out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it can't love : it starts out by showing how under chaja's loving care he's taken to the duck pond and soon starts jabbering away , beginning by saying 'quack , quack' and then going on to ask the four questions during a passover seder . 

but by showing how the boy is so terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence , refuses to speak because of his stern dad , and eventually becomes the victim of a tragic accident , the film thereby exploits the boy's sufferings and his story just becomes tiresome and not sincerely done . 

i felt i didn't just see a movie , but i attended a lecture for the whole 100 minutes of this serious but unappetizing story . 

it was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon , as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarily--the message it keeps sending was already received . 

in the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage , one has the impression that no one in the film learned anything about themselves or the past . 

that seems strange , since i thought that was what this film was supposed to be about . 

unless i was mistaken and the film's real aim was to make us cry over simcha . 
"
"there have been bad films in recent years : 'mr . 

magoo' was by far the worst ever made , the spectacularly bad 'blue in the face' , the horrible 'baby genuises' and now 'i woke up early the day i died' . 

it may not however be the worst movie made but it certainly ranks as one bad movie . 

the film's acting ( if that's what you want to call it ) is well mediocre to me . 

loaded with a sensational cast you would think that the cast would at least save the film a bit , boy was i wrong . 

after escaping from a mental institution 'the thief' played by billy zane goes out in the real world and finds that it is pretty harsh and gritty . 

he turns to burglary to survive , robs a loan back , kills the loan officer and runs with thousands . 

a country-wide man hunt is on for him to catch him and bring him down . 

he ends up in a cemetery where he puts his money in a coffin to keep it for later , comes back and realizes that someone took it and put it somewhere . 

now he is determined to kill all the visitors at the funeral earlier that day until he gets his money back , ultimately leading to a finale that is less that satisfying . 

a film which was based on a 'long-lost' script by ed wood , i have only one question : no dialogue , only music and movement where exactly is the point ? 

the film moves along at a rather slow pace , but does have one advantage : the soundtrack which is catchy and vibrant except the first song which can be offensive to some . 

it opens with a fun , innovative opening credits sequence and quickly goes downhill after that . 

some of the low points are when 'the thief' steals a woman's purse , and then she faints , sandra bernhard as a dancer and tippi hendren as a deaf woman whom 'the thief' kills to the music of 'psycho' . 

come on people get some new ideas already ! 

what's even worse is that the film has no plot at all . 

well to a certain extent it does , but who cares by the time the middle of the film arrives we're bored out of our mind and ready for something fun and exciting to happen . 

'i woke up early the day i died' is a perfectly bad film . 

it shows us how low filmmakers get sometimes just when desperate to make a movie . 

even with the huge cast talent , the film is a waste of my time and certainly a waste of yours .

"ironically , one of the themes of 200 cigarettes is that you should try to make the best of every moment in life . 

unfortunately i will no longer be able to say that i lived every moment of my life to the fullest , because i spent 95 otherwise perfectly good minutes , watching this sad excuse for a movie . 

actually smoking 200 cigarettes in the same 95 minutes couldn't be any worse for you than it is to watch the movie . 

not only is it a pathetically bad film overall , but 200 cigarettes actually has no redeeming qualities whatsoever . 

the plot is scattered , thin and predictable ; the acting is monumentally bad ; and the style of film making resembles a home video . 

it is december 31 , 1981 and the big party is at monica's ( martha plimpton ) house . 

but no one has arrived yet . 

her 8 invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups . 

some of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica , and some are total strangers . 

but they all are to face their own personal neuroses before night's end . 

those who are invited are the ones that have the issues . 

it is up to those who aren't to help them come to terms . 

first there is eric ( brian mccardie ) who is a former boyfriend of monica's and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance , or lack thereof . 

he is one of the most bland characters , in a film full of dullness , because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical , a common trait of this poor production . 

bridget ( nicole parker ) and caitlyn ( angela featherstone ) who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new year's eve and tag along to the party with them . 

they stumble across a nameless bartender ( ben affleck ) who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfections . 

he is nether sexually deprived , nor uncertain about his future , as he is in law school . 

his lack of flaws is both boring , unrealistic and painful to watch . 

as bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub-standard comedy . 

moving on , there is val ( christina ricci ) and stephie , ( gabby hoffman ) 2 teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts . 

val is monica's cousin and a true fan of the new york scene . 

on the other hand , stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just can't find . 

paradoxically , it is 2 punks that they meet at a bar ( actually they attempt to flee from their presence , but aren't successful ) who guide them through their fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds . 

of all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples , only one approaches a level of decency in both acting and plot . 

wisely , the movie's creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy ( courtney love ) and kevin ( paul rudd ) who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless . 

paul has just broken up with long time steady ellie ( janeane garofalo ) and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship . 

however , the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends , and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening . 

finally , there are the two worst performances and worst sub-plot of the film . 

jack ( jay mohr ) and cindy ( kate hudson ) have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindy's virginity the night before . 

while she attempts to play this down and be her usual self , he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy . 

very often , when a film is as putrid as this production , there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory . 

however , this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted . 

instead , what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts , bad continuity and inaccuracies . 

first , and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another , there is no apparent order that it follows , and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot . 

at other times , objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot . 

there are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish . 

not in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver . 

and yet , no matter how miserable this film may be , and no matter how poor the acting is all around , there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots . 

perhaps , if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or , perhaps , even three , there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development , or quality acting , or even a decent plot payoff at the end . 

but it didn't happen that way . 

the cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance , and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball to drop at midnight . 
"
" "" the fugitive "" is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made . 

it takes realistic , believable characters and tells an exciting story that's totally believable throughout . 

this isn't an over-the-top action flick for the sake of action , this is an intelligent adventure story with a real sense of mystery to it and it works perfectly . 

harrison ford stars as dr . richard kimble , a man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife . 

the entire premise of the story revolves around this murder , but is not told in a straightforward manner . 

we constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimble's perspective . 

hints are dropped from various times of the night kimble's wife , helen ( sela ward ) was murdered . 

we don't get to see who the killer is until much further into the story . 

in fact , we might even have a little doubt about kimble's innocence ourselves . 

the film doesn't spend much time on the details of kimble's trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story . 

one of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck . 

but it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated , it is actually suspenseful to watch . 

this movie is so incredible because it's able to take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable . 

tommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard , a u . s . marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives . 

from the moment he appears we know a huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur . 

kimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other . 

most of the film deals with richard's complex investigation as he tries to find the one-armed man who killed his wife . 

ford does not have a lot of lines here , so it is stuart and twohy's script and davis's outstanding direction that make the film as great as it is . 

just watching richard use his keen intelligence and wits , disguising himself , and doing his own detective work is very interesting . 

we know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed , so as he learns more so do we . 

meanwhile gerard and his staff are using all their skills to hunt him down . 

at one point they run into each other and a great chase ensues , but richard is just too smart for them . 

he leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence and to help him solve the mystery . 

one of the greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor . 

there is a great sense of comradeship between gerard and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo ( pantoliano ) and biggs ( roebuck ) . 

they are trying to catch what they believe to be a dangerous murderer , yet they constantly start up small talk with each other , making funny wisecracks and one-liners , but not in any kind of distracting manner . 

the final act concludes with another terrific chase . 

richard figures out who the killer is and confronts him , and although we get a typical fight scene , the case is far from solved . 

the man who ordered the murder has been under our nose all along , and we don't realize this until the end when both richard and gerard put the pieces together . 

maybe the finally scene is a bit much , but it still has a believable atmosphere to it . 

we're so relieved when justice is served . 

it's not the plot is that makes "" the fugitive "" great , it's all the motions the characters go through to make for an intriguing story . 

watching a seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so adventurous . 

if only hollywood could produce more movies like this .

"salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets . 

actors who demand such salaries might be greedy , but in some instances they are quite justified , because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation . 

proof for that can be found even in the realm of low-budget movies , and one fine example is breakaway , 1995 thriller directed by sean dash and starring ( in ) famous figure skater tonya harding . 

face of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movie's poster , but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra , attractive woman who works as a courier for gangster . 

one day she decides to retire , but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about that . 

realising that her life suddenly became worthless , myra starts running for her life , followed by professional assassins . 

terri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater . 

although tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities , her acting leaves much to be desired . 

on the other hand , her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality , believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave b-films a bad name . 

martin sheen's brother joe estevez , whose character looks like he had entered from another movies' set , is the only bright spot of breakaway . 

unfortunately , he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya harding's silver screen debut proved to be her last film .

"the scene at the end of 1989's `dead poets society , ' when robin williams' english students stand up on their desk and say , `captain , my captain , ' gets me every time . 

unfortunately , the court room scene near the end of robin's newest film , `patch adams , ' doesn't have anywhere near the same impact . 

from the surface `patch adams' looks very promising . 

it's a story about a not so young man , patch adams ( robin williams ) , who finds meaning in his life through helping sick people . 

when the film opens , we find patch , depressed and suicidal , checking himself into a mental hospital . 

in a few scenes , strongly reminiscent of `one flew over the cuckoo's nest , ' he ends up helping the patients through their problems ; and it's here that he finds how much he loves working with people . 

so he checks himself out of the hospital , and heads straight to medical school . 

right from the start , patch uses comedy to help make the patient more comfortable . 

he continuously breaks medical tradition and makes the dean of the school angry . 

shortly after joining medical school , he meets and falls in love with carin ( monica potter ) . 

they , along with patch's dork friend , truman ( daniel london ) , start a medical clinic for uninsured people . 

once the dean catches wind of the clinic , he tells patch he can't graduate and kicks him out of school . 

patch , like what any true american would do , takes the school to court . 

it's here where the not so climatic court room battle takes place , over whether or not patch can become a real doctor . 

i have never seen a movie with some potential just completely blow it . 

it seems more like a series of short sketches , rather than a full-length movie . 

considering it runs almost two hours , much too long for such a light film , it could have flowed much smoother . 

not to mention the fact of how serious the film takes itself , and manages to cover all the cliches of bad melodrama . 

robin williams saves the film from being abysmal with several comic scenes that elevate the movie to entertaining and worthwhile levels . 

but those moments are rare and in the end `patch adams' is barely average . 
"
"isn't it the ultimate sign of a movie's cinematic ineptitude when you can't think of much to say about it other than "" it sucks "" ? 

one of the first official year 2000 releases , supernova is such a movie . 

i can't seem to get past one-word adjectives with this one , although "" boring , "" "" stupid "" and "" absurd "" doesn't amount to much of a review . 

a shame . 

i would have been able to save myself the chore of desperately trying to elaborate . 

but c'est la vie . 

here goes nothing . 

i'll keep it short . 

i suppose the first bad omen for supernova came when director walter hill ( 48 hours ) removed his name from the movie , requesting that it be replaced with the pseudonym thomas lee . 

the film's fate was sealed in many minds when struggling studio mgm declined to screen it for the press , an event usually signifying a studio's lack of confidence in a particular movie . 

hill's and mgm's actions were prudent . 

when the captain of medical space vessel nightingale dies in a tragic hyperjump accident , a reformed drug addict who is also the first officer , for some reason ( james spader ) is forced to take command . 

the ship picks up a distress call from a nearby planet and , on arrival , picks up one survivor from an apparent accident in an abandoned mining colony . 

one of the crew members ( angela bassett ) knows this passenger , who is played by peter facinelli , and has some bad feelings about it -- and we all know what that means . 

this intergalactic hitchhiker is carrying some mysterious cargo -- a jellylike substance the purpose of which is unknown , though it seems to bring some form of pleasure to whoever touches it . 

another one of the crew members experiences this first hand ; after spending a few minutes partially inside this glob of goo , he does some impressive handstand pushups . 

evidently , touching this enigmatic egg-shaped thingie makes you younger and stronger . 

how ? 

why ? 

the movie never bothers to explain . 

soon enough though , spader and bassett are running around the ship like mad , being chased by the all-of-a-sudden-superhuman facinelli . 

to be honest , i don't even remember exactly why . 

i just remember that i didn't care . 

supernova's plot suggested some more or less interesting ideas , such as the ball of goo being an intergalactic time bomb , but they are all dropped before they have a chance to develop into anything truly intriguing . 

in fact , everything is dropped just so the actors can have some fun running around what looks like an elaborate set . 

well , the effects are good , though there's hardly a studio movie with bad special effects these days so i'm not sure whether that's so remarkable an accomplishment . 

the performances are hardly worth talking about . 

i'm not even sure i can call what's here "" performances , "" though angela bassett sure is good at giving people the finger . 

james spader is not a bad actor , but he proves to be one of the blandest action stars i've seen in a while , mostly because he isn't given a character with a personality . 

the action scenes are just as bland , since they're pretty much just rehashes of action elements that weren't particularly entertaining the first time around . 

and since the action scenes are everything to this movie , it's pretty much dead in the water . 

and for the life of me , i can't figure out why it's called supernova . 
"
"2 days in the valley is more or less a pulp fiction knock off . 

it basically involves how a bunch of quirky characters in the los angeles area end up having their lives become intertwined in some very unusual ways . 

i'm not going into much greater detail than that , since it would take forever to explain , and quite frankly , i'm not willing to spend any more time on it than the 2 hours that i've already wasted . 

while it tries very hard to be pulp fiction , 2 days in the valley falls way short . 

this is quite a condemnation considering the cast includes danny aiello , james spader and jeff daniels . 

while the story isn't much , and the dialogue and characters rate only marginally better , 2 days in the valley does have a couple of bright spots . 

james spader's character , while not much better than the rest , is at least fun to watch in a sick sort of way . 

and we do get to see a nice cat fight between uber babes teri hatcher and charlize theron ( in her first role ) . 

you know a movie isn't that good when the highlight is a brawl between two women . 

even if they are both gorgeous . 

i will give the writers some credit for the fairly clever ways in which they managed to intersect the lives of this group of characters that would have otherwise never interacted . 

but marveling at that ingenuity is a far cry from actually enjoying the result . 

while some of the characters and their respective stories are fairly interesting , they inevitably are brought down as they intersect with the other half of the characters that i really cared absolutely nothing about . 

if i were to put a number on it , only about half of the story and half the characters in this movie were particularly interesting or otherwise enjoyable to watch . 

this is the sort of movie that only a huge fan of one or more of the cast members should rent , and even then prepare for disappointment . 

not even charlize theron being naked would get me to sit through this movie again . 

or at least not all of it anyway .

"retelling the classic story of joan of arc has been a popular trend this year . 

earlier this may , leelee sobieski played the passionate title role in the top-rated miniseries that debuted on cbs . 

and now , director luc besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent by god to rescue france from the clutches of their enemies . 

starring milla jovovich , who is predominantly unconvincing as the heavenly messenger accused of being a witch , `the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is a disjointed and overblown historical re-enactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of the famous legend . 

besson ( who's previous work includes the hyperactive sci-fi `the fifth element' ) perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in ex-wife jovovich , because in `the messenger' , the actress is drowning in a pool of her own inexperience . 

at first , when reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role , i was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of such a caliber . 

after seeing the rousing trailer , my hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed - milla jovovich looked superb . 

with the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance , `the messenger' looked like a timeless epic in the making . 

a timeless epic it is not . 

besson is hesitant to abandon his unique and flashy style , and the story behind `the messenger' is not entirely suited to his demands . 

on the shoulders of besson's choppy and unexciting direction , the film dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery . 

there is no human exploration into the character of joan ( or jeanne ) . 

jovovich merely rambles on about the power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective . 

jovivich's unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to the realization that besson sees jeanne as a piece of spiritual cardboard . 

she is just another special effect in this continuous visual feast . 

jovovich does have a few isolated moments of sheer power , but mainly , she looks lost . 

quite frankly , i don't know of any actress who could successfully navigate her way through `the messenger' without a major fumble . 

the script is chock-full of laughable dialogue and unfortunate comedy , as jeanne confronts the uncrowned king charles vii ( john malkovich ) and informs him of her heavenly intentions . 

faye dunaway plays charles' overbearing mother-in-law , and dustin hoffman appears over two-hours into the story as a character dubbed ? the conscience' . 

all three actors juggle limited screen time , although malkovich is uncharacteristically awful . 

the battle scenes are extremely bloody , but with the presence of such jittery camera work , they capture none of the excitement or finesse of something like `braveheart' . 

there's a particularly graphic and unsettling scene early on , when jeanne ( as a young girl ) watches in horror from a closet as her older sister is murdered and then savagely raped by a bloodthirsty english soldier . 

even his fellow troopers are petrified . 

`the messenger' is also strictly a 90's update on the classic story . 

almost too 90's , it seems . 

there's gratuitous use of the f-word and a barrage of slang terms like `she's nuts ! ' 

sprinkled throughout the screenplay . 

i was half-expecting jeanne to invite her homeys to come chill in her crib , but it never happened . 

there's also the familiar presence of bizarre besson humor , but none of it comes even remotely close to functioning properly . 

it seems terribly misplaced , but in a catastrophe as jumbled and disjointed as `the messenger' , almost everything does . 

the musical score by erric serra is spectacular , and the set and production designs are continuously impressive . 

if it was visual excellence that besson was striving for , then he achieves his goal . 

but the only time the dramatics come alive in `the messenger' is during the closing trial , in which jeanne is found guilty and burned at the stake . 

during these moments , the historical relevance and dramatic purpose of joan of arc reaches the audience , albeit in a faint stream of light that provokes little power or meaning . 

it's just too delayed for besson to revive his lifeless interpretation , in which he is always concerned with the wrong aspects . 

`the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is an unlikely and unwelcome historical addition to the hollywood shelf . 

anyone searching for an entertaining epic is going to be painfully slapped with an overblown and confusing film . 

despite my original hopefulness , milla jovovich is not going to have to worry about thanking the academy .

"titanic is so close to being the perfect movie it's upsetting that it isn't . 

the film , which cost $200 million+ to make and could of put 20th century fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it 'sunk' ( pun intended ) is a labour of love for cameron , who wrote and directed the film . 

we all know that big budget dosen't mean great film ( see waterworld ( 1995 ) ) but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic . 

but sadly , titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece ( although it is one of cameron's best films ) 

the film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic . 

they find a safe , and inside a picture of a woman . 

the woman in the picture ( an old winslet ) tells the explorers that the picture is of her . 

the explorers invite her over , and she then tells her story of titanic . 

in the flashback , dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson , who , after winning a poker game , wins two tickets to board the grand ship titanic , leaving liverpool to go to america . 

also boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater ( winslet ) who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosen't love at all , cal hockley ( zane ) so her family can remain rich . 

she nearly commits suicide on the ship , but jack comes to the rescue , saves rose , they fall in love , and cal gets jealous and eventually tries to kill them . 

oh yeah , and the ship sinks . 

and that is the main problem with the film , and which stops it from being a work of genius . 

the story and script ( both by cameron ) are both weak . 

the story is full of cliched characters , ( the creepy man who the nice girl has to marry , the poor boy with heart , the stuck-up mother ) and poor dialogue ( the script consists of lots of in-jokes of how the boat won't sink , and most of the dialogue is pretty basic ) it's a shame really , as the audience does have to sit through 3 hours of this film . 

without good dialogue , a film could become a very long , very boring film ( like camerons own terminator 2 , 1992 ) but , luckily , there are some redeeming features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear . 

firstly , there's cameron's direction . 

there are some great sweeping shots of the titanic , and some clever fades between the flashback titanic and the ruined titanic . 

but the scenes cameron directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end . 

there is a lot of mayhem and panic , all done very well by cameron . 

it's a scary sight , watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below . 

thanks to cameron's direction , then , the audiences attention is held for the full 3 hours 15 minutes . 

to support the directing are the excellent cast , working very well with their underwritten characters . 

dicaprio is good , although he only looks 16-17 years old . 

his performance of a over excitiable , yet also well mannered boy is excellent , and he also has some funny lines . 

winslet is great also , and her transistion from a well mannered rich girl to a rebelous young adult is pretty smooth . 

zane is deliciously evil as cal , saying every line with a sneer and a flicker of the eye lash . 

the audience really does come to hate him . 

he may be playing the same character he plays in every film he's in ( like dead calm , 1988 ) but he does it really , really well . 

also worthy of note is kathy bates ( edward scissorhands , 1990 ) as a loud mouthed american . 

finally , the icing on the 'great things' cake are the special effects . 

cameron is a whiz with effects ( just watch aliens ( 1988 ) , terminator 2 and true lies , 1994 ) and they are used very well throughout . 

the sweeps of the ships are awesome , although digital domain , who did the effects , cannot animate human movement too well . 

the humans seem to move to 'smoothly' , there's just something odd about them . 

you can tell that they have been animated on a computer . 

of course , the ship sinking scenes are awesome , with bodies flying all over the place , and the scene where the ship splits in half has to be seen to be believed . 

titanic is one of the only films where effects have reinforced the film . 

titanic , then , is a wonder of directing , acting and cgi , but not writing and story . 

again , like most of camerons films , the editing is loose ( cameron edits himself ) , and the film could of come in under three hours with a few more cuts . 

titanic , then , although not the godfather of movies it could of been , is a wonderful attempt at creating a work of genius . 

enjoyable , scary , and even sad , titanic is a film cinema was invented for , filling the screen with incredible images , and assaulting the ears with awesome sound . 

a superb film , but sadly not perfect .

"georges polti once wrote a paper called "" the thirty-six dramatic situations , "" in which he asserted the fact that all drama could be defined by no more than thirty-six different situations . 

this may be the modern restatement of the biblical prophecy from ecclesiastes , "" there's nothing new under the sun . "" 

the faculty , the latest movie by from dusk till dawn director robert rodriguez , certainly proves this in typical hollywood fashion . 

there's not a measureable fraction of original material in this unworthy outing . 

drawing elements from both the puppet masters and invasion of the body snatchers , screenwriter kevin williamson ( of scream 2 credit ) gives us a horror tale set in middle america ( ohio ) one eventful fall . 

making use of a cast of unusually stock characters , williamson designs an alien invasion that will not be done independence day-style but rather "" through the back door . "" 

parasitic aliens take over the faculty of a run-down high school and soon have infested most of the student body , leaving it up to the ensemble of principal characters to win the day . 

the lack of gusto is the movie's major stumbling block . 

even though the genre has seen movies that have a lack for quality such as this , they've been saved by an energetic approach . 

this casts more than a shadow of a doubt on williamson's ability , who enjoyed success with the wes craven-directed scream but couldn't pull anything solid in for this outing or i know what you did last summer . 

although he designs the faculty with more of a sci-fi bent than his typical slasher picture , it still comes down to the same results : throw the stock characters in a steel cage match and see who comes out alive . 

on that level , the main roles are played by virtual unknowns . 

only the recognizeable elijah wood ( deep impact ) is at the front ; other than that , the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of the alien teachers . 

perhaps williamson has it in mind to champion these up-and-comers to the fame that their scream and last summer counterparts achieved ; but to do that , they'd all need to star in their own wb television show about the horrors of puberty a la "" dawson's creek . "" 

needless to say the acting is far from top notch , nor does necessity ask that it should be . 

there is a moment or two of genuine horror , but unfortunately williamson and rodriguez did not take the story far enough in the sci-fi direction to make any use of it . 

in sum , the faculty was just one long shot that did not pay off .

"have you ever been in an automobile accident where you've miraculously walked away with only a few scratches , yet the car has been obliterated into an unrecognizable , mangled wreck ? 

well , that has never actually happened to me and i hope that none of us will ever experience this situation . 

but after watching this inane exercise of a movie , i certainly feel that i've miraculously walked away unscathed after a two-hour ride that mercilessly careens back and forth before finally plummeting into an icy pond . 

oddly , `eye of the beholder , ' which is a psychological-romance-thriller , starts off promisingly enough when the opening sequence introduces us to a british intelligence agent , called the eye ( ewan mcgregor ) , working in washington dc . 

in the humorous opening scene , he eyes a top lawyer across the street in his office with his pants down . 

using an array of high-tech surveillance and communications equipment , he proceeds to transmit pictures of the bared lawyer to pc screens and fax machines in his office . 

the law firm's employees get a good chuckle . 

the audience gets a good chuckle . 

the eye is later given an assignment where he encounters a beautiful woman ( ashley judd ) . 

there is something compelling about this mysterious woman . 

despite her glamorous looks , however , we learn that she is a psychopath with a propensity to kill men that get too close to her . 

after the murders , she sobs while singing the christmas tune `little bluebirds' and laments about being abandoned by her father long ago . 

after each killing , she puts on a different wig , assumes a new name , and then makes her way to another state . 

the eye has witnessed all her murderous transgressions . 

but he does not alert the authorities . 

he somehow empathizes with her sense of loss . 

the eye , it turns out , also is haunted by his past . 

his daughter was taken away from him and he anguishes this loss every day of his life . 

his tormented psyche creates a ghost-like image of his daughter with which he engages in conversation . 

she becomes a sort of spectral adviser , and one thing that the ghostly daughter says is that he must help the woman . 

he now diverts his energies into trying to help her find some kind of salvation . 

it doesn't matter that he has witnessed all of her murders . 

and it doesn't matter that the eye is abnormally reticent , hiding his entire life behind computer screens . 

he follows her to a dozen different locales and shadows her every move to keep her out of trouble . 

when a crazed druggie ( jason priestley ) attacks her , he shows up for some quick butt kicking . 

when the police are closing in to arrest her , he provides a distraction so that she can escape . 

all the while , the woman has no idea who her guardian angel is and the eye stays just out of sight . 

peculiar . 

how bad is this movie ? 

i refer you to my `review quote source' litmus test . 

just take a look at the full-page ad in the newspaper and see where they are pulling quotes . 

for this movie , they are from magazines called `flaunt' and `mirabella . ' 

no doubt , they were impressed with judd's series of catwalks and disguise changes . 

the major problem with `eye of the beholder' is that the film jerks forward , always unsure of its ultimate destination . 

if it was a thriller , there was little to keep us entranced . 

if it was a love story , there was absolutely no emotional pull . 

completely disjointed in structure , it's only saving grace was its stylish look which reminded me of my favorite car commercial ( the one where the `6' on the tachometer dissolves into a winding road and a passenger rail car dissolves into a small miniature on a child's train set ) . 

i am also still hopeful that ashley judd will find a serious role to showcase her potential talents . 

beyond that , the film is hopelessly out-of-control and is in need of seriously better traction and handling .

"the disney studios has its formula for annual , full-length animated features down so pat that it's hard to remember which one you're watching at any given moment . 

 "" mulan , "" their 36th animated adventure , is the latest case in point . 

once again we have a tale focused around a strong central character ( female as usual ; disney is one of the few studios whose heroines--ariel , belle , pocahontas , and now mulan--get equal screen time with their heroes in recent years ) . 

add the requisite love interest and a wise-cracking sidekick or two , pep up the soundtrack with a handful of strategically placed show tunes ( an introspective number by a pool or looking in a mirror , a rousing anthem , a cutesy , montage-backed crowd pleaser ) , pose a few threats to our engaging lead , and tie things all up neatly by the closing credits . 

bob's your uncle ! 

better make that walt's your uncle . . . 

kids will no doubt go ga-ga over "" mulan "" ( or at least the fast food tie-ins ) , but familiarity can , after a while , leave grown-ups--this reviewer included--wishing for a little more . 

maybe an animated feature without--shock ! 

horror ! --the 

songs , for example ? 

or maybe a film in which a cheeky chihuahua called pepe longs to become a matador from trinidad ? ? 

how about simply ditching the sidekicks altogether ? 

it isn't gonna happen . 

like disney's previous entries , "" mulan "" is slow to make its mark . 

the animation tends to suffer from some slackness in the early going and the humorous element , a madcap dragon wannabe ( in the guise of a loquacious lizard with a case of dry mouth , courtesy eddie murphy's animated vocal talents ) , plays like an inappropriate if necessary ( formula-wise ) afterthought . 

however , after about an hour everything comes together and the formula , like it or not , clicks . 

highlights include a spectacular cavalry charge on a snow-covered pass ( which , due to the sophistication of today's computer-generated imagery , is hard to tell from the real thing ) , a memorable , show-stopping musical interlude ( "" i'll make a man out of you , "" penned by matthew wilder and david zippel ) , and last but not least , mulan herself . 

voiced by ming-na wen , mulan is disney's strongest female character to date . 

when hordes of huns pour over china's great wall and threaten to overthrow the imperial palace , the emperor decrees that every family in the land dispatch one man to serve in the imperial army . 

since mulan's father is infirm , but proud , the high-spirited mulan steals her father's armor and , incognito , signs up to face the mongolian menace . 

attracted to , but not distracted by , her commanding officer shang ( b . d . 

wong ) , mulan outmatches her fellow combatants in smarts , wit , and physical ability . 

she's a woman of the '90s a couple of millennia ahead of her time .

"kate ( jennifer aniston ) is having some problems . 

it appears the twenty-eight year old is not happy with her slow progression up the company ladder , and her love life apparently leaves something to be desired . 

she learns that her problems are related , as the owner of her advertising agency , mr . mercer ( kevin dunn ) , explains to her that her single status does not bode well with the company . 

her freedom would make her more likely to leave the company , taking clients with her . 

a solution presents itself in nick ( jay mohr ) , a wedding videographer who kate meets through a coincidence and gets photographed with . 

kate's boss , darcy ( illeana douglas ) , uses the photograph to fabricate a wedding engagement between kate and nick . 

kate is at first repulsed by the idea , but after getting immediate positive results , she pursues it . 

her first task is to convince nick to go along with her plan . 

the actual plan consists of nick pretending to be her fianc ? . 

at a dinner with kate's bosses he will provoke a fight and they will break up . 

she meets nick to propose the plan . 

he accepts . 

kate's new status brings unexpected results in other areas . 

the office bad boy , sam ( kevin bacon ) , who wouldn't give kate the time of day , now does . 

now that she is engaged , he pursues an affair with her , as doing so would destroy her good girl image , hence sam's sudden interest . 

things start to fall apart for kate , as it becomes apparent that nick really likes her , and does not wish to break up with her . 

after some provoking nick does oblige , but problems continue for kate . 

it appears sam is no longer interested now that she is available . 

or maybe kate does like nick , but "" reconciliation "" will force her to admit her lies to her employer . 

adding to her mess is the constant prying of her mother ( olympia dukakis ) , who wants her to get married and settle down . 

there is a scene in this movie where jennifer aniston is ( from the waist up ) only wearing a bra . 

it made me chuckle because it is the only time in the movie when she actually wears one . 

there is enough cleavage in this movie to satisfy russ meyer . 

it's like the director said 'well , we know the story is formulaic and the performances aren't that great so , what the heck , let's show jennifer's assets as often and as uncovered as humanly possible to keep the pg rating . "" 

quite frankly it's insulting . 

i don't think aniston is a competent enough actress to carry a movie . 

she did a decent enough job in ed burns' "" she's the one "" because it was a smaller and supporting role , and she just doesn't deliver the goods effectively in this movie . 

her performance was not convincing . 

unfortunately , as far as romantic comedies go , this movie adds nothing new to the standard formula for these types of movies . 

the film is similar to "" my best friends wedding "" in a sense that the leading female character is actually quite vindictive and due her actions , gets no sympathy from me when things go awry . 

i didn't care for how quickly kate puts down nick's profession by explaining that videotaping weddings wasn't glamorous enough for her co-workers . 

at least "" my best friends wedding "" changed the formula a bit and had a somewhat surprise ending . 

no such luck with "" picture perfect "" . 

every plot occurrence can be spotted a mile away , including a couple that really made no sense . 

after everything kate had done to prove her loyalty to her company , why would she blindly throw it all away when she should have made sure that nick would even talk to her first , let alone consider a relationship ? 

was quitting her job a prerequisite to making amends with nick ? 

throw in the fact that i don't think nick and kate spent enough time together to even warrant that rash of a decision . 

i believe that kate liked him , but liked him so intensely that she was willing to throw her career away ? 

i doubt it . 

and what of the ending scene at a wedding where the entire congregation feels it necessary to stop everything and stare at the couple ? 

are mass groups of people simultaneously that interested in total strangers ? 

well , i guess of the congregation consists of movie extras and the strangers are the movies two lead stars , then that would make sense .

"hollywood has a . 750 

batting average with elmore leonard adaptations . 

last year's touch was ill-conceived and just plain odd but get shorty , jackie brown and now out of sight all were highly entertaining movies . 

steven soderburgh , master of sex , lies and videotape , now adds crime to his repertoire in this tale of bank robbery , prison , double-crossing , uncut diamonds and , oh yeah , true love . 

george clooney is the protagonist , a risky choice after such duds as batman and robin and the peacemaker , but for once i didn't want to slap the taste out of his mouth . 

he plays his role in out of sight as the suave cary grant-type perfected in hitchcock movies , the kind of guy to whom crime is just a profession like any other . 

nowhere present is clooney's usual ain't-i-sexy sneer -- there's just enough leftover lightheartedness to fit in with the leonard style . 

clooney is definitely a perfect successor to john travolta in get shorty . 

clooney plays a man who's robbed about 200 banks without ever using a gun . 

in the opening scene , he walks into one bank and robs it not only with ease but with charm . 

of course , he gets caught , so it's not all good . 

it's while doing time in a florida prison that clooney learns of one rich inmate's ( albert brooks in a frightful bald wig ) collection of diamonds in detroit . 

clooney and cohort ving rhames plan the score , while protection artist and fight promoter don cheadle begins rival plans . 

meanwhile , there's jennifer lopez . 

unintentionally funny in selena and intentionally funny in anaconda , she's finally graduated to a worthy role as the u . s . marshal who happens to be driving up to the jail on the night clooney escapes . 

rhames is waiting to give him a ride in a stolen car , and lopez makes it a threesome , her hostage ass locked in a trunk with clooney . 

he's covered in dirt and has a gun to her neck , and it's a little cramped in there , but they manage to make a love connection anyway , probably because it's a movie . 

the relationship between clooney and lopez is at the heart of the movie , and one of the details that elevates it beyond your normal noir-ish crime story . 

the leonard movies are more obsessed with dialogue than crime , and this is no exception . 

although they're not really germane to the plot , lopez's relationship with her father ( dennis farina of get shorty ) , rhames' relationship with his christian sister ( you could call her sister christian ) and a pop-in cameo by michael keaton all lend extra class to a movie already full of it . 

out of sight spans at least three years but has a non-linear structure , focusing on the jailbreak / brooks score and flashing back to earlier times . 

this is a movie with a brain , as smooth and calculated as the clooney and lopez characters themselves . 

the entire cast does the material justice -- clooney and lopez coming into their own , and rhames and cheadle cementing their positions as two of my favorites . 

here's hoping future leonard adaptations continue to carry the torch . 

serving america for almost 1/20th of a century ! 
"
"by trying to satisfy every kind of viewer , it's possible that sphere may end up pleasing no one . 

action lovers will be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup . 

audience members who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by the film's sudden collapse into mindless storytelling and by the ending , which is an insulting cop-out . 

somewhere out there , maybe there's a small cadre of film-goers who will appreciate sphere's dubious charms , but i'm not among them . 

i sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie ( i no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham ) , because if the finished motion picture product is anything to go by , it's hard to understand why the rights were optioned . 

sphere is the kind of first- class mess that only a top-line director with an a-list cast can create . 

with expectations high ( and how could they not be , considering that another barry levinson/dustin hoffman collaboration , the excellent wag the dog , is still playing in theaters ? ) , 

something this bad can't help but look even worse . 

the last time a big-name , big-budget film displayed this level of ineptitude was last year's batman & robin , and everyone knows how that movie was received . 

sphere starts out a little like an amalgamation of contact and james cameron's the abyss , but , somewhere along the way , it collapses into the cellar with another recent science fiction effort , event horizon . 

science and philosophy , which are used to good effect during sphere's first hour , give way to mindless , confusing action sequences . 

attempts at characterization fall apart . 

intelligent writing , which is evident early on , is replaced by hackneyed drivel . 

special effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness . 

but all that is just in preparation for the ending , which is inexcusably awful . 

this is the time-honored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect . 

i left the theater feeling cheated by the way crichton and his screenwriters had chosen to end the film . 

there is some promise , but it's all in the setup . 

we're introduced to norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) , a psychologist who once wrote a $35 , 000 report for the government about what to do in the event that a crashed space ship is discovered . 

when one is found in the middle of nowhere , 1000 feet below the surface of the pacific ocean , norman is called in to be part of the welcoming committee . 

on the team with him are beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist who was once his student and lover ; harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , a mathematician who earned his first doctorate at the age of 18 ; ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist who is awed by the opportunity to explore alien technology ; and harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , the government operative in charge of the mission . 

together , the five descend into the bowels of the ocean , where they rendezvous with a temporary sea base on the ocean floor from which they will attempt to make first contact . 

for a while , sphere had me fooled into thinking it was going to take an astute approach to the man-meets-alien situation . 

the overall scenario is not without promise and several plot twists ( such as the revelation that the enormous craft is actually an american space ship , apparently from the future ) offer intriguing possibilities . 

then , right around the one-hour mark ( that's the time to sneak into the theater next door and check out whatever's left of titanic ) , the virtually non-stop action begins , and , once it starts , the script becomes superfluous . 

this might be acceptable if director levinson generated some legitimate tension , but , instead , he relies on loud , overbearing music , strange camera angles , and quick cuts to make things "" exciting . "" 

additionally , because none of the characters are well-formed ( a common failing in anything penned by crichton , who's more interested in technology than people ) , viewers don't develop much of a rooting interest . 

it makes sitting through sphere a frustrating and pointless experience . 

what about that a-list cast ? 

not surprisingly , the most energetic performance is given by samuel l . jackson , but his harry isn't a person ; he's a walking plot device spouting occasionally-witty dialogue . 

dustin hoffman isn't lively or particularly good -- it's ironic that this , which may be his worst work in a decade , has arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination ( for wag the dog ) . 

sharon stone and peter coyote are both flat . 

their characters exhibit little evidence of emotion ; automatons would have been as effective . 

then there's queen latifa , who , despite getting fifth billing in the credits ( ahead of liev schreiber , who boasts at least quadruple her screen time ) , has less than a handful of lines and almost nothing to do other than inflate the body count . 

i like to think that levinson and hoffman , recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be , chose to make wag the dog as a sort of penance ( the low-budget picture was filmed during sphere's lengthy pre-production phase ) . 

if that's the case , forgiveness is granted . 

i'm less inclined to look favorably upon crichton , although he has a few enjoyable titles on his resume ( jurassic park and the levinson-directed disclosure come to mind ) . 

even if his novel was butchered in the adaptation process , crichton's credit as a producer disallows him absolution . 

he was a willing participant in a creative travesty . 

no wonder sphere is being released in february , in the midst of the early year's cinematic wasteland . 

it deserves no better than to get sunk by the unstoppable titanic , which should plow sphere under on its way to a ninth-consecutive weekend atop the box office heap . 
"
"up until about a year ago , john travolta's career consisted of those "" look who's talking "" movies ( notice how they never called them look who's talented ) and the 1991 bomb shout ( which was bad enough to make most people scream ) . 

but somewhere along the line , travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again . 

weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame and fortune once again , while barry , robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a 1993 straight-to-the-cutout-bin album aptly named "" size isn't everything "" ( and of course , they learned that sales are everything ) . 

but now travolta's back on the hollywood scene once again , and i think we all know why . 

four words : contract with the devil . 

and this has nothing to do with newt gingrich's "" contract with america . "" 

no , satan is much more humane . 

anyway , yes , travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld . 

how do i know ? 

i own the document in question . 

amazing what you can buy at those collector's shops for a few hundred dollars , isn't it ? 

get shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction , with travolta as crime minion chili palmer . 

he goes to collect some of the mafia's money from a b-grade director ( gene hackman ) and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game . 

sure , a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood , but i guess that's beside the point . 

palmer is determined to get hackman's next project made , so he sets out to convince big star martin weir ( danny devito ) to star in the movie , bringing along down-and-out horror actress karen flores ( rene russo ) , who has already had affairs with hackman and devito . 

it doesn't take a las vegas odds-maker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well , after the customary sexual tension and denial , which has been used in every comedy from "" who's the boss ? "" 

to speechless . 

it works in this case , unlike "" who's the boss ? "" 

although it's interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also . 

complicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackman's other films and want in on this one too , along with travolta's mob boss trying to track him down for defecting . 

get shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction , despite the obvious similarities . 

this movie doesn't have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies i've seen this year ( yes , even better than halloween vi ) . 

get shorty is my kind of movie , one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence . 

i'm definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on . 

are you getting this , shorty ? 
"
"warning : contains what the matrix is . 

rated r for sci-fi violence . 

starring : keanu reeves , laurence fishburne , joe panteliano 

some may be disappointed with the matrix . 

i'll tell you i was . 

i sat there and sat there and sat there waiting for something to happen . 

now wait wait , i know most of you loved it , and i'm not saying i didn't like it . 

what i'm saying is the first half was extremely slow . 

now seeing the trailer it makes you think the whole entire movie is one big special effects show . 

don't be fooled , this movie has a big story . 

and big chunks of talky moments . 

but i will admit the special effects and the acting were above par , deserving the rating above . 

ok now to the story . 

well this may take a while . 

ok first of all , our world we live in now , is not the real world , actually we live inside a computer generated world known as the matrix . 

a man played by keanu reeves is about to find that out , when is kidnapped and almost coaxed to go into the real world . 

he does so , and finds out that he can do anything , be anything he wants to be . 

but he has to fight a 'matrix skipping' bad guy , who wants to send him back to his own world or destroy him . 

laurence fishburne , his guide of sorts plays his character well as does keanu reeves . 

but i sat in the theatre for over and hour wondering where all the special effects were . 

yeah there were some in the first half but not enough . 

the trailer for this movie was really decieving making people think that this was a special effects laden movie . 

now for the second half , it is explosive , and saves the movie . 

some of the special effects and fighting were breathtaking . 

the sound , the music , and all the effects were effective , and the last hour kept us entertained . 

but with a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes , this movie is at least 40 minutes too long . 

one would have wished for a better 'matrix' , but i do have to say , i did like it and i was entertained . 
"
"here's a concept -- jean-claude van damme gets killed within the first ten minutes of the movie . 

now if that isn't enough to get you to finally see a van damme movie , i don't know what is . 

all sarcasm aside , it is certainly a different way to start a movie , of course a few minutes later we find out that the newly deceased had a twin brother -- so lucky us , we get to see more of jean-claude . 

van damme #1 works for the russian mafia in the united states and is killed by some of their operatives . 

van damme #2 is a police officer in france who finds out that he had a twin brother he never knew about after #1 gets killed in france . 

the remaining twin ( the french cop ) goes to the united states to find out who killed his brother and avenge his death . 

once there , he hooks up with his deceased brother's girlfriend , played by natasha henstridge , and the two of them set out to discover who the murderers are . 

jean-claude's acting abilities don't seem to be up to the usual lackluster standards in this movie . 

in other words , just in case you missed the sarcasm , his acting is worse than normal . 

on the upside , natasha henstridge is in this film , and she does what she did best in species -- she gets naked . 

sadly , this is probably the high point in the movie . 

she is actually a decent actress , but didn't improve as much as i thought she would after species . 

this is the typical van damme movie , with jean-claude doing a variety of high end martial arts moves on his opponents . 

nothing new here , and certainly nothing we haven't seen in every other van damme movie . 

simply put , there is absolutely nothing new about this movie . 

it has a retread plot -- this isn't the first time jean-claude has played twins . 

he still can't act . 

we all saw natasha's breasts in species ( although this is one repeat performance i'm not complaining about ) . 

this is pretty much like every movie that van damme has ever been involved in -- sub par . 
"
"jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities , but whom you end up liking anyway . 

in as good as it gets , the character in question is melvin udall , a successful novelist with obsessive-compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible , except when he feels like being a royal pain in the you-know-where . 

he's mean . 

i mean really mean . 

the opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium . 

every day , melvin eats at the same cafe , sits at the same table , and gets served by the same waitress . 

you can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance , when his waitress carol ( helen hunt ) tells him he can just go sit in another section , and all the other waitresses just cringe . 

one day , melvin makes a comment that goes to far , and carol , genuinely hurt , comes down on him like a ton of bricks . 

at that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course , but is also the only person who can get to him , too . 

another person who often crosses melvin's sights is simon ( greg kinnear ) , an artist who lives on melvin's floor . 

aside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city , simon has the added benefit of being gay , making him a prime target . 

simon's friend frank ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , also gay , does not fare much better . 

when simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment , he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital , and frank , who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor , intimidates melvin into watching after simon's dog while he convalesces . 

this is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage . 

an interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in : melvin gets to like the dog , and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvin's softening up to the world around him . 

it doesn't happen overnight , but throughout the film , he bites his tongue here , cares a little there , and most miraculously , falls in love . 

one of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others . 

he's traveling terra incognita here , and it shows . 

good performances are turned in by all principal players in this film , especially by nicholson and hunt . 

they play well off of each other and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them on screen . 

greg kinnear , who is becoming known for his supporting film roles , is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon . 

he gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist , and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels . 

cuba gooding jr . performs with a hyped-up level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear , and comes through with a near constant comic performance . 

the screenplay , by mark andrus and james l . brooks , is clever , touching , and funny . 

the best part about it , however , is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting . 

melvin is a man we can't quite figure out , but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention . 

carol is a working woman living with her mother , trying to take care of a child with a debilitating respiratory problem . 

simon is a man who is a success in his circle of peers , but who is still not accepted by much of society . 

combined with the talent of the actors , these characters make the film . 

the one noticeable area where the film is lacking , however , is the absence of cuba gooding , jr . through the second half . 

his character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary , but the film ends before his return , leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved . 

i would have liked to have seen more of his character in general , in addition to a part in the film's conclusion . 

there's one actor , who will probably not be recognized by any awards , but who contributes greatly to many of the movie's best scenes and who deserves mention . 

this is that little dog . 

he plays such a pivotal role to melvin's character development , actually serves to forward the plot , and has some absolutely scene-stealing moments , that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal . 

award or no , however , when even the dog puts in a good performance , you know you've got an outstanding movie . 
"
"as a devout atheist and an avowed believer in aliens , i have some idea of how ellie aroway ( jodie foster ) feels . 

but because my reasons for not partaking in religion are different than hers , i can't say that i do exactly . 

her reason is that she needs solid proof : there is no proof that god existed , so therefor she does not believe . 

ellie also believes in aliens , and has spent most of her life trying to prove they exist . 

how can she say she doesn't believe in god because of the lack of proof , and then say she believes in aliens , which are gereally less believed in than god without sounding like a hypocrite ? 

that's the catch-22 . 

when aliens from the star vega fax her some plans for a device to transport someone to them ( okay , well , they didn't really * fax * them . . . ) 

ellie wants to be the one to go , but because of her atheism she is denied the position . 

how dumb is that ? 

she discovers the transmitions , then she isn't allowed to go . 

well , because of a bomb and a psychopath ( jake busey ) , she * does * end up going , but not in the way that we would've thought . 

contact is based on a novel by carl sagan , who died during the filmmaking . 

it is the best alien movie since close encounters of the 3rd kind , and will end up being the best film of the year . 

its views of science and religion will no doubt aggrivate some , but will stimulate more . 

i'm glad at least one movie of the '90s can portray aliens in a psitive light , rather than a bunch of slimey beasts who will eat your insides and then put on your body .

"making a sequel to a widely beloved film is a weighty proposition indeed , especially when the first film is considered by many to be a masterpiece . 

when it comes to living up to expectations , a filmmaker is almost doomed to some degree of failure . 

for a sequel to live up to or even surpass the original's greatness is very rare indeed . 

and whereas "" babe : pig in the city "" misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe , it is a worthy companion piece . 

more than that , it is a spectacular work of art that deserves to stand alone in its own right . 

 "" babe : pig in the city "" warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like "" the godfather : part ii "" and "" the empire strikes back "" as being one of the greatest sequels ever produced . 

 "" babe : pig in the city "" picks up precisely where "" babe "" left off . 

having won the sheep herding competition , farmer hoggett ( james cromwell ) and his pig are elevated to fame status . 

a series of unfortunate circumstances and hilariously freakish events leads to mrs . hoggett taking babe from the small country farm into the big city . 

in doing so , the film transports us into a wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors and exceeds the creative design seen in the original . 

 "" babe : pig in the city "" flourishes where so many sequels fail . 

most sequels simply rehash the events of the first film . 

not "" babe : pig in the city "" . 

this is a completely original tale that offers up a story drastically different than the first . 

also , by not being content to utilize most of the old characters , this film gives us many new ones to enjoy . 

in essence , it doesn't attempt to copy itself . 

instead , it strives to achieve an originality of its own . 

and it succeeds . 

that's not to say the familiar is absent . 

 "" babe : pig in the city "" retains some of the best core elements and characters from the first film . 

along with babe himself , ferdinand the duck comes along for the ride , as does mrs . hoggett ( one of this decade's best and most underappreciated comic characterizations , hilariously performed by magda szubanski ) . 

the three singing mice also make the journey , chiming in with their cute high-pitched vocals . 

the story structure is also similar as each segment is introduced with title cards read by the aforementioned mice . 

from there , we are guided once again by roscoe lee browne's soothingly deep narrative . 

composer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that is perfect for cinematic fables such as these . 

but these elements are simply the frame that surrounds an entirely new painting . 

while staying at the flealands hotel , babe encounters a veritable ark-full of new animals . 

monkeys , kittens , and dogs of various breeds and sizes are some of the new "" urbanites "" that babe befriends , as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdinand the duck happens to encounter . 

each character is distinctly unique , some of which are imbued with personal human-like struggles that are endearing and touching . 

and while this world focuses largely on these animals , we are introduced to two new human characters as well . 

mary stein plays the owner of the flealands hotel , an animal-loving young spinster who harbors these lost creatures much to the dismaying anger of her fellow neighbors . 

stein's landlady is a wonderfully odd caricature . 

we also meet fugly floom , an old soft-spoken clown who owns many of the animals in the flealands hotel , utilizing them as a part of the act that he performs at different parties and functions . 

not having known who portrayed fugly floom prior to seeing the film , it came as an unexpected pleasant surprise to see who it was . 

so as not to ruin this well-kept secret , i won't reveal the actor's identity here . 

it was a treat indeed to see one of cinema's legends grace the screen again in what was a superbly gentle and heartwarming performance . 

the greatest triumph of "" babe : pig in the city "" is the art direction . 

simply put--it bleeds creativity , taking the look of the original film to a whole new level . 

restricted primarily to a farm the first time around , this second installment creates an entire city , dazzling us with unique fable-like architecture . 

but the stroke of pure genius by production designer roger ford is his use of our world's architectural landmarks . 

designing a skyline that includes the statue of liberty , the sydney opera house , the brooklyn bridge , the hollywood sign and the eiffel tower , ford has created a singular city that encompasses all of our cities ( as seen in the film photo and pre-production drawing to your right ) . 

added to that , many of this city's streets are the twin siblings of venice's gondola-trekked rivers . 

the metropolis that has sprung from ford's vision is a wondrous sight to behold . 

it is a world that you want to walk around in . 

norma moriceau's costume designs belong in this world , vibrant in color and style equal to that of the ford's landscape . 

most of the costumes are imaginatively cartoonish , with the most exotically grand design going to that of fugly floom's clown outfit . 

andrew lesnie's photography captures these elements with various lighting moods that are beautifully effective in creating the film's multiple emotional tones . 

much press fodder has been made over the weeks leading up to the release of "" babe : pig in the city "" . 

reports stated that its original cut was branded with a pg-13 rating . 

these reports were discovered to be false as it was assigned a pg rating . 

but even so , to be anything harsher than the original' s g rating had many parents and fans up in arms . 

by deleting a minimal number of shots , "" babe : pig in the city "" was eventually given the coveted g rating . 

although appeased , many fans were still concerned that it would be too dark , fearing that the film may have come to be possessed by tim burton himself . 

well , to coin a phrase , the reports of "" babe : pig in the city "" 's death at the hands of a dark , scary , felliniesque interpretation have been greatly exaggerated . 

granted it has its moments of pseudo-morbidity , but all-in-all "" babe : pig in the city "" is the funny and charming adventure that everyone was hoping it would be . 

whatever "" dark "" moments it may have can be attributed to director george miller ( the "" mad max "" trilogy , "" the witches of eastwick "" , "" lorenzo's oil "" ) . 

having served as a producer and co-writer on the first film , miller moves into the director's chair for this one , putting his own unique sense of style into this budding franchise . 

the story of "" babe : pig in the city "" is an enchanting yarn , but one that doesn't achieve the emotional or character depth of the original . 

missing here is the attempt to broach such heady themes as personal identity , an individual's worth , challenging conformity , and one's purpose in life . 

 "" babe "" dealt with this weighty subject matter , creating a timeless fable . 

 "" babe : pig in the city "" should not have rehashed these themes , but i do wish it would have attempted to explore new ones . 

this film is not bereft of moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife , class differences , sacrificial courage , and so on . 

but this film's goals aren't as lofty as the first's , instead choosing to take a more straightforward approach , allowing its themes to take a back seat to an exciting , sometimes intense , fable adventure that is undeniably clever and inventive . 

 "" babe : pig in the city "" also decides against developing a relationship to the level of which was present in the first film , specifically the one between farmer hoggett and babe . 

hoggett's love for babe , which grew ever so gently , is what gave that film its charming and endearing quality . 

best exemplified in hoggett's dance for babe , this moving relationship was truly unique . 

it is something that i wish would have been present again ( and could have through fugly floom ) , but was not . 

please understand , these are not negative criticisms , per se' , but simply statements of what i see as the differences between "" babe : pig in the city "" being a very good film and the original being a great one . 

but having said that , these observations are minor critiques at best . 

as an overall piece , "" babe : pig in the city "" is a thoroughly enchanting and entertaining fable from beginning to end . 

sure , it isn't a great film , but it is an excellent one that possesses elements of greatness . 

it is a film that is magical with its charm and humor , exciting in its adventurous exploits , funny with its dry wit and cute voices , and breathtaking in its presentation . 

 "" babe : pig in the city "" may not be moviemaking at its absolute best , but it is on level of cinematic quality that is rarely achieved or seen in cinema . 

as a result , if you choose to let this film pass you by , you will be missing of the year's best cinematic treats .

"it's almost amusing to watch 21-year old christina ricci get drastically overshadowed in sally potter's follow-up to 1997's the tango lesson , the man who cried . 

the gen-y actress , with her cold stare and big , black eyes , has appeared in an impressive range of films ; but she doesn't even come close to being the bold heroine the film , set against the historical backdrop of world war 2 , requires her to be . 

ricci , whose character is shockingly silent and blank , showing only the occasional smile or hint of concern , shares most of her scenes with the astounding cate blanchett : quite an amusing sight to behold . 

blanchett's lola , a paris dwelling dancer who befriends the aspiring singer suzie , is bold , interesting and layered ? everything our heroine lacks . 

co-star of the upcoming lord of the rings trilogy , blanchett has a good seven inches on ricci , sports twice the makeup and dons a flashy wardrobe . 

the actress inhabits the role ? as she always so remarkably does ? with a fervor and life that makes you want her to hold the screen as the film's lead rather than her dull companion . 

important historical events involving hitler and his nazis scatter themselves across the film ; these landmarks serve as the film's little conflict . 

obviously , the tables are turned in the life of suzie by these events , whose jewish origin is unknown among her parisian colleagues . 

the man who cried has many aspirations , none of which come full circle by the film's close . 

there are forced messages here and there : "" go forward ; always go forward , "" lola preaches to suzie ; there's romance between suzie and a fellow target of hitler's nazis , the gypsy cesar ( johnny depp , who , like ricci , barely gets to speak ) ; lola struggles with her character that desires above all things wealth and men who have it ; and at the core of all these devices lies suzie's desire to travel to america , where her father journeyed after leaving her and her mother years ago . 

the film's main problem is that potter isn't skilled enough to tell the epic-sized story of suzie . 

the time period's instability , the conflicting social classes , the prejudice against suzie from all those around her in her new life : serving as both writer and director , potter throws in some of each , but hardly an inch of depth is to be found in any . 

by the time the sigh-inducing climax hits , the believability and complete absence of focus leave one ready to leave the theater . 

the film's falling action is weirdly unsatisfying and unlikely ; are we really meant to believe any of this could happen ? 

contrastingly , in its moving final scene , the man who cried strikes a note that is made effective in its ties to the emotional beginning of the film . 

although it's apparent that potter can't grasp what she reaches , i'm puzzled as to why she reaches for so much in the first place . 

ricci's suzie is meant to be the film's core : from the extended flashback at the film's beginning to the quickly drawn ending , everything seen in the film , in some way , relates to her . 

so why then does potter spend so much time on subplots involving other individuals ? 

the character of suzie is too present for the man who cried to work as an ensemble , but not present enough for the film to be ricci's . 

the almost constant lack of flow and one-note tone with which potter depicts the man who cried are somewhat improved upon by sacha vierny's beautiful cinematography that renders the film's various locations wonderfully . 

also worthy of note are lindy hemming's costumes that help to depict the area quite nicely . 

and then there's the music . 

from minute one to minute ninety-seven , there's hardly a moment when the wavering , skilled voice of an opera singer or the rhythms of the gypsy music don't undercut the action ; the notes stricken both overwhelm ( particularly john turturro , portraying fictional opera singer dante dominio , whose money and reputation catch lola's interest ) and accompany ( oftentimes , the perfect chords are captured to undermine the state of the film's characters and reinforce that state ) . 

potter obviously cares much about each and every musical note ; unfortunately , the same effort isn't given towards ( almost ) everything else .

"stallone attempts to 'act' in this cop drama . 

the film is set in a neighbourhood pratically built by kietal , who's nephew ( played by michael rappaport ) is involved in a car crash and killing of two black youths . 

keital dosen't really want to get involved in anything , gets rid of rappaport , and stallone and de niro try to work out what the hell is going on . 

this film should be brilliant . 

it sounds like a great plot , the actors are first grade , and the supporting cast is good aswell , and stallone is attempting to deliver a good performance . 

however , it can't hold up . 

although the acting is fantastic ( even stallone isn't bad ) the directing and story is dull and long winded 

some scenes go on for too long , with nothing really happening in them . 

in fact , the only scenes that do work are action scenes , which i suspect stallone was trying to avoid . 

in this film , serious means dull . 

the dialogue is warbling , and basically just repeats the same points over and over , no matter who is delivering them . 

the plot , which has potential , is wasted , again just being cliched after a while . 

in fact , the only thing that does keep the film going is kietal and de niro , both delivering their usual good performances . 

however , stallone , although not given much to say , gives a good performance . 

however , it's not all that bad . 

as said above , the action scenes are well done . 

theres also a very good ending , which uses the cinemas sound system well . 

in fact , the last 10 minutes of this 2 hour film are one of the best endings of 1997 . 

if only the rest of the film was as good as the ending . 

cop land , then , turns out not to be a power house film , but a rather dull , and not every exciting film . 

hugely disappointing , and i can't really recommend it . 
"
" "" i'd rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell , "" earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher . 

with that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister , hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story . 

he will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american , and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation . 

from elmer gantry on , we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church . 

well , think again , for the apostle , which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade , does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister , and by implication all , the rest of organized religion . 

instead it gives us a highly devout man , who certainly has his foibles , but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god . 

and arguably just as surprising , the good-spirited film is no comedy , even if it does have humorous moments . 

instead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures . 

when in the privacy of his attic , robert duvall , as texas preacher euliss "" sonny "" dewey , argues sternly with his lord , the scene shares a kinship with emily watson's character crying out for her god in breaking the waves's most powerful scene . 

the body of the story starts with sonny's coming upon an horrific auto accident , which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters . 

with his well worn bible in hand , sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over and with the accident's dying victims . 

the scowling police officer orders him to go away , and , after he has tried to work his miracles , sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lord's work . 

robert duvall not only gives a moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the film's director , writer , executive producer , and chief financier . 

rarely has a movie been such a labor of love . 

with a white suit , peach-colored shirt and tie , and dark sunglasses , sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher . 

duvall has every movement down pat . 

even when he is walking down the street , the ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy . 

he dances and claps all the way . 

sonny's churches having more black members than white means that he shares his preaching duties with many deep-voiced black orators , but his rhetoric is always competitive . 

 "" i may be on the devil's hit-list , but i'm on god's mailing list , "" he shouts to the congregation in a revival tent . 

and they lap it up . 

people jump up , scream , "" praise the lord ! "" 

and mean it . 

the intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable . 

but sonny is no saint . 

it turns out that he has a wandering eye , which angers his wife jessie , played in a remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett . 

jessie gets her revenge by taking up with the church's youth minister and conniving to gain control over sonny's church , leaving him unemployed . 

sonny , letting his temper get the best of him , does something foolish , which causes him to have to leave town and two beloved kids forever . 

the bulk of the film occurs in a small , predominately black church in louisiana , which he builds up from a derelict building with no congregation into a remodeled church ( "" one way road to heaven : holiness temple "" ) with an enthusiastic flock . 

in this part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e . f . the apostle is a hard worker willing to take on any odd job necessary to obtain the funds for his church . 

he asks his members to tithe , but he gives all of his money . 

and his good deeds extend to secret donations of food for the local poor folks . 

a man who can't stand to be still , he tells one of his friends , "" i quit school because i didn't like recess . "" 

in his new town he meets toosie ( miranda richardson ) , who , like him , has a family that she hasn't seen in a while . 

his romance with the separated woman , like the rest of the film , doesn't follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies . 

billy bob thornton shows up one day playing a local racist and general troublemaker . 

his confrontation with the apostle is yet another of show's many surprising scenes , again breaking many rules and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take . 

although it probably couldn't have ended any other way , the movie does wrap things up nicely . 

and don't miss the sweet epilogue during the film's closing credits . 

a tour de force acting performance by duvall and a surprising and unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outstanding and moving film . 

the apostle runs a little too long at 2 : 12 . 

it is rated pg-13 for mild profanity and brief violence and would be fine for kids eleven and up . 
"
"more than forty years ago , the "" sword and sandals "" genre of historical epic ruled the box office . 

during the 1950's hollywood sought to give audiences a reason to turn off their televisions and go out to the movies by offering the grand spectacle of the roman empire in cinemascope . 

 "" ben-hur . "" 

 "" cleopatra . "" 

 "" the robe . "" 

 "" sparticus . "" 

 "" the fall of the roman empire . "" 

 "" quo vadis . "" 

sometimes brilliant , sometimes campy , the roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood . 

since then , epics have appeared infrequently ( "" the last emperor , "" "" braveheart "" ) and some of the best have been small-screen affairs produced in the 1970's ( "" roots , "" "" shogun "" ) . 

yet , the phrase "" we who are about to die salute you "" has been absent until now . 

 "" gladiator "" begins in germania in a . d . 180 . 

roman general maximus ( russell crowe ) has conquered yet another group of barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , and he is eager to retire to his plantation in spain where his wife and son are waiting . 

however , the emperor is worried that his decadent weakling son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) will prove a poor successor , so he wants to make maximus his heir as a transition toward rome becoming a republic again . 

when commodus hears the plan , he strangles his father and orders maximus and his family murdered . 

maximus escapes from the executioners , but he arrives home too late to save his wife and son . 

a caravan of slavers pick up the wounded hero and carry him off to north africa . 

 ( why the caravan happened to be cruising by maximus' place is never explained . ) 

an african named juba ( djimon hounsou ) treats maximus' wounds . 

proximo ( oliver reed ) , a gladiator who won his freedom , purchases maximus and juba as fodder for the arena . 

of course , maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier , and his fame spreads . 

when commodus reopens the coliseum , proximo brings his troupe of warriors to rome to compete . 

our hero wins the hearts and minds of the cheering crowds and finds that he has an ally in commodus' sister lucilla ( connie nielsen ) . 

the similarities to "" braveheart "" are obvious : an evil king , a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family , the aid of a lovestruck princess . 

also , like mel gibson's epic , "" gladiator "" has a primarily visceral appeal and is driven forward by the hero's anger . 

it's a simple tale of good versus evil . 

maximus has all the manly virtues : nobility of purpose , courage in battle , loyalty to king and country , physical stamina , and devotion to family . 

commodus is his opposite in every way : a sniveling , selfish coward who is intended to disgust the audience . 

the opening night crowd in my theater was about 70% male , and that seems appropriate . 

 "" gladiator "" is a guy movie ( would the opposite of a "" chick flick "" be a "" dick flick "" ? ) . 

there's much pumping of testosterone and chopping off of body parts in gruesome battle sequences . 

 ( those easily offended by gore should stay away . ) 

lucilla is the only female character , and what sparks there are between her and maximus are dampened by his devotion to his dead wife . 

joaquin phoenix gives an astounding performance . 

in the scene where commodus kills his father , phoenix shows the pain of a son who has never had his father's love or pride . 

throughout the picture , phoenix manages to give depth to a character who's scripted as a caricature of evil . 

i've been a russell crowe fan since "" romper stomper . "" 

this role doesn't offer him the complexities of his parts in "" l . 

a . confidential "" and "" the insider "" -- essentially his job is to grunt heroically -- but his voice , which has a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp , is perfect for the genre . 

the late oliver reed gave us the best work of his career in his last role . 

i hope it will be rewarded with an oscar . 

my only major quibble with "" gladiator "" is its stylized look . 

several scenes are tinted . 

we've seen a lot of the tinted look lately , particularly in "" payback "" and "" the matrix . "" 

i don't get the appeal of the style , which makes feature films look like tv ads . 

in "" payback "" it was merely annoying , but in "" gladiator "" it bleaches the color out of the grand spectacles that are the raison d'etre of the roman epic . 

 ( perhaps it's meant to gloss over the imperfections of the computer-generated shots . ) 

also , the battle scenes are filmed in a strange herky jerky style that seems to be slo mo and fast forward simultaneously . 

 ( it reminds me of the way the flash runs in the comic books , leaving a half-blurred trail of images of himself behind . ) 

with a more realistic look , "" gladiator "" could be even more satisfying than "" braveheart "" because it has a tighter script and a more fulfilling conclusion . 

bottom line : a rousing action film enriched by fine performances but tarnished by stylistic choices . 
"
" "" have you ever heard the one about a movie so bad that it made a guy run out of the theatre screaming ? "" 

obviously the producers at columbia tristar did not think that we suffered enough from the first installment , and so to finish us utterly , they have now released "" urban legends : final cut "" . 

this is another "" scream "" -like feature , consisting merely from the recycled materials of rip-offs from the most pointless movies of all time . 

amy ( jennifer morrison ) is a film student who is attending a film school filled with uninspired film students who do not have a clue about what to do . 

but just as she reaches the halfway mark of her final semester at prestigious university's film program -- where each year's best thesis production takes the coveted hitchcock prize , a virtual one-way ticket to hollywood success -- she has a chance encounter with campus security guard reese ( loretta devine ) , whose tale of a series of murders based on urban legends at another university inspires amy to try her hand at a fictional thriller organized along similar lines . 

soon enough , fake -- and real -- blood starts to flow , and amy is being chased around by scary killer , while her cast and crew get slain , one by one . 

is the culprit the original urban legends murderer , just some random psycho , ! 

a member of the faculty , one of her competitors for the hitchcock , or is there something even more stupid going on ? 

this is another one of those tiring , pointless teen slasher flicks : neither scary , funny , or interesting . 

it simply lacks the ability and the story to entertain . 

the body counts and screams continue to grow , as the weak level of intelligence sinks rapidly . 

in fact watching films like that after having watched "" scary movie "" is impossible keeping a serious face . 

several times i tried to prevent myself from laughing , without succeeding . 

and then i realized that practically the whole theatre was laughing . 

it's the same thing that has been told and told and told over and over again as if it was the revelation of the century . 

how many times must we tolerate the same clich ? s that have haunted the slasher genre since its birth ? 

it has been so many films about masked killers that most of us have developed an allergy for them . 

they are the most stupid , meaningless , predictable and soulless films in existence . 

however , director john ottman manages to make "" urban legends : final cut "" into one of the worst achievements of this godforsaken genre . 

what was done with a sense of redemption for past failures and irony in "" scream "" , ottman takes seriously . 

for that reason alone , it is worth a look , just to realize how bad a movie can be . 

it's tough to find comparisons for such an achievement , and we have to dig in ancient history to find a movie that would match its intellect . 

even movies like "" lost in space "" and "" mission to mars "" seem spectacular in its shadow . 

we have not seen such waste of t ! 

ime and resources since "" showgirls "" ( 1995 ) . 

no matter how hard i tried to find positive elements in this so called production , i came up with nothing , except the way the killer was dressed . 

here i feel that i have to compliment the costume designers trysha bakker and marie-sylvie deveu , that have wisely replaced the well known scream-mask with a very elegant fencing mask . 

jennifer morrison ( "" stir of echoes "" ) is all right , and the other actors' best achievement is keeping a straight face when pronouncing the words from the script . 

in fact the only thing that is terrifying about this film ( with the exception of its screenplay ) is its portray of film schools . 

if these graduates will be the directors of the future , then hollywood's golden days are over . 

rumors are already spreading through the internet that columbia tristar is already developing a third installment . 

let's just hope and pray that it's just an urban legend . 
"
"since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 1993's steven spielberg drama "" schindler's list "" and directed 1993's intelligent "" searching for bobby fischer , "" his new film , "" a civil action , "" should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career . 

what doesn't make sense is how such high-profile and superb actors as john travolta , robert duvall , william h . macy , and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project , which is both dull and completely ineffective . 

the film , which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia , certainly contains the type of story to be emotionally-charged , but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings , leaving us with nothing more than a poorly-done courtroom drama . 

based on a book by jonathan hart , which was consequently based on a true account , "" a civil action "" is set in 1982 in the town of woburn , mass . , where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann ( john travolta ) decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their children's death from leukemia due to unknown causes . 

jan originally decides to drop the case , but when he stumbles across to corporate giants , grace and beatrice foods , who have plants located near the families' homes , he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place : the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which , thus , goes into the city's drinking water . 

suddenly , after hearing about the families' heartbreak and personal stories , he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery , even though he is warned by his staff accountant ( william h . macy ) that no money is coming in to them , only going out . 

also figuring into the story is jerome facher ( robert duvall ) , beatrice foods' corporate counsel , who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his $20-million offer to settle the case . 

coming from such a talented writer , director , and cast , not to mention one of the most interesting film composers , danny elfman , "" a civil action "" is an astoundingly empty-headed drama , one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience . 

perhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture , zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an absence of magnetism and even meaning . 

watching the film , i couldn't help but notice its similarities with 1997's far , far superior film "" the sweet hereafter , "" which dealt with a lawyer , played brilliantly by ian holm , investigating a school bus accident that killed a number of children . 

in his attempts to find someone who may have been responsible for the accident , holm interviews the grieving parents , as well as the sole surviving passenger , a teenage girl , which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter , a young drug-addict who has run away from home . 

not only was the plotting similar to "" a civil action , "" but it also had the same exact running time of 115 minutes . 

considering this , it is amazing how fulfilling and truthful "" a sweet hereafter "" was , not only concentrating on the school bus accident , but delving deeply into ian holm's character and his own personal demons , as well as the teenage girl . 

in "" a civil action , "" however , i have no idea where the running time went , since the film is virtually two hours of nothingness . 

we do not get to know the parents very well , nor any of the main characters . 

through its whole duration , i did not learn one thing__not one thing__about travolta's lawyer character , jan schlictmann , who doesn't appear to have any sort of life or purpose outside of his job . 

every scene is tediously related directly to the premise , and therefore , there was no one for me to care about or root for . 

you've got to work pretty hard , actually , to not get an audience to become involved in the parents' plight , since their children are dead , but that is exactly what "" a civil action "" does . 

to be honest , i would be fairly hard-pressed to state an aspect of the film that i actually liked . 

aside from one flashback to when a man's young son died on the way to the doctor , i remained unmoved and passive about what was going on in the scenes , and more than once found my mind wandering . 

i could say the performances were good , but who's fooling who ? 

since every character is one-dimensionally written , no one's acting abilities are challenged in any way . 

travolta plays a lawyer well enough , but that's about all he does . 

duvall virtually sleepwalks through his role , apparently only appearing to give one-liners at every chance he gets . 

and what in the world is kathy bates doing in the picture's final scene , as a judge ? 

she appears unbilled , since it is just a cameo , but why did she even agree to do it in the first place ? 

finally , when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began to role , the film left me with another question : what was the point ? 

abruptly ending without any susceptible momentum , where none came before that to begin with , "" a civil action "" seemed to me , at least , to be an example of how not to make a courtroom drama , and it certainly did not do justice to the very serious subject matter the film deals with .

"the grandfather of italian horror the late mario bava has credits in nearly 100 films and tv movies produced in italy between 1939 and his death in the early 80's . 

more practiced as a cinematographer than a director , bava nonetheless sat in the director's chair for beyond the door ii , the project which turned out to be his last full-length feature film . 

alongside the appalling zombie schlock of hacks like lucio fulci , beyond the door ii is simply a revelation . 

in his day bava was considered by most to be no great filmmaker , yet here he fashioned one of the finest italian horror movies of the 1970's . 

 ( note that the film has no connection with the 1975 exorcist-rip off behind the door , but for some unexplained reason was given this related title for release in the usa and australia . ) 

this story focuses on dora , a women set upon by a malevolent spirit that channels itself through her young son marco . 

the film opens with dora , her son and second husband bruno returning to a house by the sea that was the scene of her first husband's suicide and her subsequent trauma 7 years earlier . 

they hope to put the past behind them , but as small accidents start to befall dora - usually while bruno is away on business - she starts to suspect that marco ( played with uncanny ability by 8 year old david colin jr . ) is somehow involved in the strange goings on . 

to reveal any more of the story would be unfair . 

suffice to say that this artfully paced study of a woman suffering a nervous breakdown offers an intriguing plot , loads of atmosphere and solid acting , though the dialogue is somewhat weakened by the dubbing into english . 

bava coaches a surprisingly good performance from the usually wooden daria nicolodi , wife of famed italian horror director dario argento . 

her character is invested with sufficient depth to allow the audience real empathy with dora's troubled soul . 

the music by italian ensemble libra is also effective , mixing odd-sounding 70's rock with classic gothic piano sequences . 

and there is at least one moment - brilliantly engineered by bava - that is guaranteed to lift you ten feet out of your chair . 

yet for italian horror , the bloodletting here is surprisingly minimal . 

lamberto bava and francesco barbieri's script is more concerned with deeper , psychological terrors , with themes of guilt and suffering , with the notion that what we sow will shall - somewhere , somehow - eventually reap . 

scholars of the genre take note : beyond the door ii is stylish , chilling , and essential . 
"
"the event horizon is the boundary of a black hole . . . 

and , in the future , it's also the name of a spaceship that vanished when it tried to go faster than the speed of light by traversing through its own portable black hole . 

naturally , this is the setup for the other event horizon . . . 

the movie . 

when the ship suddenly appears at the point that it vanished at , just outside of neptune , the crew of the ship called the "" lewis and clark "" has to go to investigate , and dr . william weir , the creator of the "" event horizon , "" gets to come along for the ride . 

if you've glanced at a poster for this movie , you know that , supposedly , what follows is "" infinite terror . "" 

well , i don't know about the "" terror "" part , but "" infinite "" certainly seems to qualify . . . 

event horizon is a mean-spirited , gory , sick excuse for a film . 

it starts off as an alien rip-off , and then degenerates into a pointlessly bloody slasher flick after about 40 minutes . 

at least for those first 40 minutes it's an * interesting * rip-off of alien . 

that's a lot more than can be said for the rest of them movie , which seems to go on forever . 

it not a scary monster movie , nor is it a psychological thriller . 

it is simply a movie which tries again and again to make the viewers feel sick to their stomach at the site of extreme gore . 

you've seen this kind of movie before . 

the hellraiser series had plenty of scenes containing this sensibility . 

this is a kind of movie for which i have no respect , a kind of movie which i had hoped died out years ago . 

it is quite possible for a movie to frighten or shock its audience without resorting to nothing more than gore , but event horizon takes the low road , and the viewers pay the price . 

there are many good , respectable performances , from fishburne and neill most noticably . 

paul anderson's direction is impressive , as it was in mortal kombat . 

there are many nice special effects , mostly dealing with numerous common objects floating around in zero-gravity . 

the sets are beautiful to gaze upon . 

and richard t . jones' character ( cooper ) is hilarious and extremely likable ( more so than most characters i've seen in recent movies ) for the little screen time that he has . 

and none of this can save the movie from being a d-grade level of film . 

the idea of a ship that has some sort of life within its walls , a life that knows the fears and inner skeletons of the human passengers , is a promising one . 

a haunted house story in space isn't such a bad idea . 

but the final execution is extremely disappointing . 

that's not to say that philip eisner ( here making his feature film-writing debut ) doesn't have talent . 

for those first 40 minutes , he manages to make a tired premise interesting , adding in aspects of unique flavor into a rip-off story , and that's something that not too many writers can do . 

he even has one scene that , though it also tries to sicken the audience , has a honestly tense feel to it ( the scene in question deals with one of the crew being in an airlock while others try to save him from floating into space ) . 

he definitely has something of a gift , but it's not fully on display here . 

i certainly will look forward to seeing more from him , and i hope that his future work fully explores his talent and the story possibilities of the premise . 

but because of what this movie degenerates into , i have little or no respect , and got little or no enjoyment , out of it . 

if this is what we have to look forward to in the future of film , then i agree with laurence fishburne's sentiment - "" god help us . "" 
"
"the title is taken from the writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of a traveler as 'anywhere but here . ' 

there isn't one thing about this mother-daughter relationship melodrama that felt honest . 

it relies on a contrived minor character to tell both mother and daughter what was obvious to do in order to straighten out their dysfunctional lives , as for some reason they couldn't figure it out for themselves . 

if the film looks familiar , that is because "" the slums of beverly hills ( 98 ) "" went over the same ground but was fortunate to be more comical and perceptive due to alan arkin and natasha lyonne performances , in which they were fortunate to have a much sharper script to work with . 

alvin sargent's script was weak and annoyingly claustral . 

wayne wang's ( "" the joy luck club "" ) inept direction made a weak script even weaker by his inability to tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating what the action couldn't convey . 

pushy mother adele august ( susan sarandon ) forces her 14-year-old daughter ann ( natalie portman ) to leave a small midwestern burg to go cross-country with her to beverly hills . 

the daughter resents her twice divorced , unstable but exotic , schoolteacher mother , bullying her to be an actress as a means of escaping a humdrum life . 

the daqughter doesn't even like the used gold mercedes mother buys to drive to lala land in and can't stand the beach boys records mom enjoys hearing on the car radio . 

so it becomes a question of who knows best , as the ladies fight it out between them , until the predictable sweet ending comes in this yawner . 

adele's dream of greener pastures in beverly hills soon doesn't look that good , as she lands a job in a slum school , has her precious car scratched by the unruly kids , and settles into a job she hates in order to financially survive . 

daughter pines for small town wisconsin and her friends there . 

during one of many arguments with her free-spirited mom , they go for ice cream and while mother is being ticketed , she runs away , only to be chased down by friendly traffic cop ( michael milhoan ) , who offers her wise counsel . 

with the cop's zen wisdom passed onto the daughter , she will survive living in many different addresses in beverly hills until she reaches 17 and then she plans to get way from mom by using her good grades to go to brown university instead of ucla . 

during their stay in beverly hills , she grows from feeling awkward in beverly hills high to immediately having many high school girlfriends and even a high school rich boy admirer-- a t . s . 

eliot ( corbin allred ) reader . 

but the transition of her life into beverly hills had no feel of reality , as everything seemed staged and unemotional . 

when she learns her cousin benny ( shawn hatosy ) , who happens to be her best friend dies in a traffic accident back in wisconsin , she returns for the funeral and in those reunion scenes it wasn't clearly shown why she wants to stay there , and for that matter , it was never made clear why the mother wants to leave so badly . 

the film is one big battle of wills between mother and daughter over their dreams . 

i guess what the filmmaker is trying to say , is that mom is a bad dreamer and the daughter is the observant one , able to recognize mother's faults when not in growing pains and in need of parenting herself . 

mother has a series of setbacks , like being dumped by her dream-boat dentist ( bochner ) she met on the beach , and witnessing her daughter mimic her whiny optimistic sayings when trying out for an acting part . 

but mother learns that her daughter has grown-up and is independent and that she has to stop living her life through her . 

she learns this when the same wise cop who told ann what to do , is about to ticket her and this time will remind the mother of the right thing to do . 

this of course results in the corny ending , showing that mom's heart was always in the right place , only she went about it in the wrong way . 

this was just one of those films where you want to be anywhere but in the theater where this film is showing . 
"
"here's a word analogy : amistad is to the lost world as schindler's list is to jurassic park . 

in 1993 , after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit , many critics described schindler's list as the director's "" penance "" ( as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowd-pleasing blockbuster ) . 

now , after a three-year layoff , spielberg is back with a vengeance . 

once again , his summer release was special effects-loaded action/adventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers . 

now , following his 1993 pattern , he has fashioned another serious , inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity . 

that film is amistad . 

although not as masterful as schindler's list , amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture . 

thematically rich , impeccably crafted , and intellectually stimulating , the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact . 

watching schindler's list was a powerful , almost spiritual , experience . 

spielberg pulled us into the narrative , absorbed us in the drama , then finally let us go , exhausted and shattered , three-plus hours later . 

aspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since . 

amistad , while a fine example of film making , is not as transcendent . 

the incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books , but , considering who writes the texts , that's not a surprise . 

however , the event is a part of the american social and legal fabric , and , while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account , most of the basic facts are in order . 

several , mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the film's dramatic force . 

on the whole , while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation , it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired . 

one stormy night during the summer of 1839 , the 53 men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad escape . 

led by the lion-hearted cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , they take control of the vessel , killing most of the crew . 

adrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to africa , they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey . 

they are tricked , however , and the la amistad , which makes its way northward off the united states' eastern coastline , is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut . 

the kidnapped africans are shackled and thrown into prison , charged with murder and piracy . 

the first men to come to the africans' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) . 

they are soon joined by roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a property attorney of little repute . 

aided by advice from former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) , baldwin proves a more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for , and his central argument -- that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men , not property -- convinces the judge . 

but powerful forces have aligned against baldwin's cause . 

current president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , eager to please southern voters and 11-year old queen isabella of spain ( anna paquin ) , begins pulling strings behind-the-scenes to ensure that none of the africans goes free . 

at its heart , amistad is a tale of human courage . 

cinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain and indignity he is subjected to . 

he is a free man , not a slave , and , while he recognizes that he may die as a result of his struggle , he will not give it up . 

effectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou , whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention , cinque is the key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies . 

they are individuals , and our ability to make that distinction is crucial to the movie's success . 

to amplify this point , spielberg presents many scenes from the africans' point-of-view , detailing their occasionally-humorous observations about some of the white man's seemingly-strange "" rituals "" . 

the larger struggle is , of course , one of defining humanity . 

as the nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as "" sub-human , "" so the pro-slavery forces of amistad use a similar defense . 

the abolitionists regard the africans as men , but the slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property . 

in a sense , the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of civil war , which would break out less than three decades later , looming over everything . 

amistad's presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating , making this movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history . 

four claimants come forward against the africans : the state , which wants them tried for murder ; the queen of spain , who wants them handed over to her under the provision of an american/spanish treaty ; two american naval officers , who claim the right of high seas salvage ; and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad , who demand that their property be returned to them . 

baldwin must counter all of these claims , while facing a challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of a relationship he develops with cinque . 

even though attorney and client are divided by a language barrier , they gradually learn to communicate . 

aside from cinque , who is a fully-realized individual , characterization is spotty , but the acting is top-notch . 

matthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his "" pretty boy "" image to become baldwin , but the lawyer is never particularly well-defined outside of his role in the la amistad case . 

likewise , while morgan freeman and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson and tappan , they are never anything more than "" abolitionists . "" 

nigel hawthorne , who played the title character in the madness of king george , presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election . 

finally , there's anthony hopkins , whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done . 

hopkins , who can convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer , an emotionally-crippled english butler , and richard nixon , makes us believe that he is adams . 

his ten-minute speech about freedom and human values is unforgettable . 

one point of difference worth noting between amistad and schindler's list is this film's lack of a well-defined human villain . 

schindler's list had ralph fiennes' superbly-realized amon goeth , who was not only a three-dimensional character , but a personification of all that the nazis stood for . 

there is no such figure in amistad . 

the villain is slavery , but an ideology , no matter how evil , is rarely the best adversary . 

it is to spielberg's credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture without a prominent antagonist . 

amistad's trek to the screen , which encountered some choppy waters ( author barbara chase-riboud has cried plagiarism , a charge denied by the film makers ) , comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the incident . 

an opera of the same name opened in chicago on november 29 , 1997 . 

numerous books about the subject are showing up on bookstore shelves . 

it remains to be seen how much longevity the amistad phenomena has , but one thing is certain -- with spielberg's rousing , substantive film leading the way , the spotlight has now illuminated this chapter of american history . 
"
"on the basis of this film alone , i never would have predicted that , in two years , quentin tarantino would become the country's biggest hotshot director . 

reservoir dogs has hints of the tarantino brilliance that emerged in pulp fiction , but is a much less substantive , more conventional crime story than the big pf . 

here's what the two movies do have in common . . . 

--scenes of intelligent , amusing dialogue with no relevance to the plot --a story that jumps back and forth in time rather than going in a logical , chronological sequence --graphic yet necessary violence --an engaging crime story --dialogue liberally spiced with swear words and racial/gender slurs --three of the same actors ( harvey keitel , tim roth and steve buscemi ) --a mexican standoff ending , although this one is considerably less optimistic than pf 

reservoir dogs is an entire hour shorter than pulp fiction because it's only got one story to tell rather than three . 

crime lord joe cabot ( veteran actor lawrence tierney ) has assembled five criminals who have never even met each other to pull a diamond store heist . 

the five are instructed not to reveal their real names or personal details or anything the cops could use if one of them was captured and interrogated . 

instead , they are all given code names off the color chart -- mr . white ( keitel ) , mr . pink ( buscemi ) , mr . orange ( roth ) , mr . blonde ( michael madsen ) , mr . brown ( tarantino ) and mr . peach ( tarantino's chin ) . 

most of the movie's running time is spent with mr . white and pink waiting at a warehouse for the others to arrive . 

mr . orange , meanwhile , is on the floor , dying from a gunshot wound . 

the police had arrived at the scene of the crime way too soon , leading white to believe one of the five was an informant . 

the story's background unfolds through a series of flashbacks , of the crime itself and the meetings between joe and the criminals prior to the crime . 

eventually , blonde arrives with a police officer hostage , and what follows is a truly brutal , uncomfortable torture scene . 

let's just say picasso would be inspired by what blonde does to the cop's ear . 

a lot of the time , reservoir dogs seems like your typical gangster heist-gone-wrong movie , but there are a few sequences that are uniquely tarantino . 

the opening scene in the coffee shop starts the movie off on a high note the rest of it doesn't live up to , as the criminals plus joe have a conversation on , among other things , tipping philosophies and their interpretations of madonna's "" like a virgin . "" 

another scene involves roth's lengthy manufactured story about running into a group of cops and a police dog in a bus station bathroom while carrying a giant bag of marijuana . 

neither of these have much plot relevance but are given ample time to develop , like the captain koons gold watch speech in pulp fiction , only here these sequences are more enjoyable than the rest of the movie . 

reservoir dogs is good but it's no pulp fiction . 
"
"it was easy to fear the worst . 

begin with a classic 1960's television series , add a big budget and an a-list star in the lead role , and stir . 

script , you ask ? 

who needs one , kid . . . 

we've got ourselves a formula . 

that was my fear : a bloated monster without any sense of direction . 

then , much to my amazement , everything that could possibly go wrong . . . 

didn't . 

the fugitive is as lean , taut and tense as anything the action genre has produced in the last several years . 

under the direction of andrew davis ( 1992's under siege ) , the fugitive grips you by the throat from the outset and never lets go . 

expect box office to go through the roof , deservedly , and expect an academy award nomination for tommy lee jones . 

the premise is a simple one . 

dr . richard kimble ( harrison ford ) is wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife after struggling with the real killer , a man with an artificial arm . 

after an escape attempt by some other prisoners during a transfer goes awry , kimble finds himself on the run . 

his one goal : to find the one-armed man ( andreas katsulas ) before u . s . marshall sam gerard ( tommy lee jones ) finds him . 

where the fugitive surprises the most is the script , by jeb stuart and david twohy . 

in a genre where one is almost always asked to allow leaps of logic , the script repeatedly astonished me with its intelligence , its attention to detail and its respect for the audience . 

in an early sequence , kimble sneaks into a hospital to shave of his beard , slick back his hair and change into a lab coat . 

on his way out , a police officer jokingly tells the man he doesn't know is kimble to zip up his pants . 

it's a small moment , but it punches home the urgency of kimble's situation , and exactly what a man concerned about not being recognized might easily forget . 

later , while trying to lose himself in a parade , kimble thinks to drop his overcoat , the most likely way he'd be recognized from behind . 

it's these details which convince us that when a colleague of kimble's tells gerard that he's too smart to be caught , he may just be right . 

credit must also be given to the special effects and stunt coordinators . 

the bus crash which allows kimble's escape is a spectacular sequence , as is a leap from a dam into the water below . 

the action is crisp and brutal , and never romanticized . 

special kudos go to director davis for maintaining a relentless pace which underscores the single-mindedness of the two leads . 

and what a pair of performances those leads are . 

tommy lee jones is nothing short of brilliant as gerard , because he manages an incredibly challenging feat . 

for the first third of the film , there is really no * villain * per se ; kimble is on the run , and gerard is out to find him . 

it would have been very easy to turn gerard into a malevolent , vindictive inspector javert , but that never happens . 

instead jones plays him as a sharp , committed man who's just doing his job , so that when he responds to kimble's comment , "" i didn't kill my wife , "" with a matter-of-fact , "" i don't care , "" we know exactly what he means . 

it's not his job to determine guilt or innocence . 

it's his job to bring in a fugitive . 

this is a well- written character played with relish by an actor at the top of his form . 

the only unfortunate thing about jones' stunning turn is that it's likely to overshadow harrison ford , and that's a shame . 

for his entire career , ford has been underappreciated as an actor due to his pigeonholing as an action hero . 

however , he does a fine job with the less flashy part of kimble , always keeping at the forefront the advantage this man has because of his intelligence . 

the fugitive could only work to its fullest if the two protagonists always seemed to be on equal footing , and ford is up to the task . 

this summer has been loaded with action/suspense films , and most of them have been doing brisk business . 

however , it's time for clint , sean , and various dinosaurs to step aside . 

the chase is on . 

my advice is to catch it .

star trek : first contact a film review by michael dequina copyright 1996 michael dequina 

star trek : first contact ( pg-13 ) anyone familiar with the series of star trek movies knows of the "" even-odd pattern "" --the even-numbered installments of the series are good while the odd-numbered ones are , well , not-so-good . 

the pattern continues with the new star trek : first contact , an energetic sci-fi adventure that ( coincidentally ? ) is the eighth entry in the hugely popular series . 

in this first trek feature to feature only cast members from the late star trek : the next generation television series , captain jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the rest of the 24th-century crew of the starship enterprise--commander will riker ( jonathan frakes , who also directed ) , android lt . cmdr . 

data ( brent spiner ) , lt . cmdr . 

geordi laforge ( levar burton ) , lt . cmdr . 

worf ( michael dorn ) , dr . beverly crusher ( gates mcfadden ) , and counselor deanna troi ( marina sirtis ) --travel back to 21st-century earth while doing battle with the borg , a race of cybernetic beings that share a collective mind with the borg queen ( alice krige ) . 

the borg intend to alter history and assimilate all of humankind into their race--starting with the earth-orbiting crew of the enterprise and a 21st century stowaway ( alfre woodard ) . 

this is an interesting plotline that is sure to mesmerize trekkers everywhere and engage everyone else , but , unfortunately , it only makes up the star trek half of the script by brannon braga and ronald d . moore . 

the other half of the title--first contact--refers to a subplot that takes place on 21st-century earth , where riker , troi , and laforge meet legendary scientist zephram cochran ( james cromwell ) , who is about to embark on the first warp speed flight in human history , which directly leads to the first contact with extraterrestrials . 

while this story does tie into the main plot and pays off interestingly in the end , it is nowhere near as involving or exciting as the borg battles on the enterprise . 

not helping matters is the tiresome cochran character , an eccentric whose drunken schtick starts out funny but becomes too one-note after a while . 

in the end , though , the first contact subplot doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the film as a whole . 

the story is typical sci-fi fantasy , but the conviction of the cast--most notably the always-phenomenal stewart--makes you believe and care . 

frakes , making his feature directorial debut , keeps the action swiftly rolling along and delivers the action goods , even upping the violence a notch ( this is the first trek film to bear a pg-13 rating ) to greater effect . 

st : fc has a bigger budget than the last trek outing , the middling star trek generations , and it definitely shows on screen--the production design and especially visual and makeup effects are outstanding ( in particular those involving the borg queen ) . 

braga and moore's mostly sharp script will please both trek devotees and the rest ; the references to the borg storyline in the tv series , the continuity with the previous film ( e . g . 

the ongoing saga of data's emotion chip ) , and a fleeting star trek : voyager crossover will make trekkers squeal with delight , but such points are made easily accessible to those less familiar to the trek mythos . 

paramount was reportedly worried about the staying power of its trek franchise with the next generation cast now carrying the helm . 

based on the entertaining success that is star trek : first contact , i'd say the studio has nothing to worry about ( at least not until this cast retires and the crew of the wan star trek : deep space nine takes over . . . ) .

"i want to correct what i wrote in a former retrospective of david lean's war picture . 

i still think that it doesn't deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute's list of the 100 greatest american movies . 

and i think that lumet's "" 12 angry men "" , wilder's "" witness for the prosecution "" and kubrick's "" paths of glory "" would have been better choices for the best picture oscar in 1958 . 

but i can't deny the importance of "" the bridge on the river kwai "" - cinematically and in its contents . 

the film is set in burma in 1943 . 

a bataillon of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai . 

but the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers needn't work as simple workmen . 

struggling toughly , col . nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col . saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect . 

afterwards col . nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge . 

he considers it an opportunity to raise his men's morale , and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese . 

but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins ) . . . 

a flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people . 

they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge . 

and the film doesn't consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in "" paths of glory "" . 

lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies . 

this is also perceptible in the conversations between col . nicholson and col . saito . 

in this regard it is symptomatic that shears , who doubts the military logic , is a somehow unpleasant person in the film . 

the audience is supposed to applaud col . nicholson's perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not . 

the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col . nicholson takes for his men . 

 ( the plot by-passes these risks . ) 

that means , the picture isn't perfect . 

but it has a lot of virtues as well . 

it shows the "" madness "" of war and what war can produce in people's minds . 

it shows how col . nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics . 

and "" the bridge on the river kwai "" is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests . 

these points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti-war film ( despite the inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme ) . 

david lean's effective and atmospherically perfect direction creates a high suspense , especially in the dramatic ( though not wholly plausible ) showdown . 

alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col . nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character . 

the other actors deliver very good performances as well . 

jack hildyard's fine color cinematography and the apt score are also helpful . 

i like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses .

"john boorman's "" zardoz "" is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own . 

not since the rampant bumblings of one edward d . wood jr . has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time . 

of course , wood's career can be explained by two things : he had no money and he had no talent . 

boorman , on the other hand , cannot court such excuses to explain "" zardoz "" ( or his follow-up film , the equally awful "" exorcist ii : the heretic "" ) . 

boorman obviously had a sizable budget , a matinee idol movie star ( sean connery ) in the lead role , and although you wouldn't know it from this film , boorman does indeed have talent . 

this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece "" deliverance "" ( 1972 ) , as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama "" hope and glory "" ( 1987 ) , the slightly over-conceived arthurian epic "" excalibur "" ( 1981 ) and the father-son jungle adventure "" the emerald forest "" ( 1985 ) . 

his films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination , but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste . 

if boorman is anything , he's ambitious , and when he succeeds , it's in grand fashion . 

unfortunately , the bigger they are , the harder they fall , and when boorman falls , the resounding impact can be heard for miles around . 

 "" zardoz "" is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies , an obsession of boorman's . 

his screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even "" the wizard of oz , "" a book which figures into the movie's plot . 

but , despite all this reaching , the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling . 

the events take place in the distant year 2293 , but there is little of the typical futuristic movie-ness to be found . 

in fact , things seems to have moved backwards , with people riding horses , shooting old-style guns , and living in large victorian mansions . 

it's more middle ages than space age . 

the world of "" zardoz "" is divided into two distinct hemispheres : the outlands , where all the poor , pathetic people live , and the vortex , where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life . 

these immortals never grow old , they never engage in sexual activity , they possess psychological powers , and they live in a sort of quasi-utopian marxist society where everyone is equal , and everyone contributes equally to the society . 

however , if one breaks the rules , that person is punished by being aged so many years . 

if someone breaks the rules enough , he or she is aged to the point of senility , and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals . 

one of the immortals , arthur frayn ( niall buggy ) , a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face , is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed . 

like "" the wizard of oz , "" he adopts a god-like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head . 

 ( this flying head is one of the movie's opening images , and it's a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come . ) 

calling himself zardoz , frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders and makes them into a group called the exterminators , whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they can't procreate and take up more resources . 

from inside his giant , stone head , zardoz bellows seriously laugh-inducting statements like , "" the gun is good . 

the penis is evil . "" 

that line alone is worth the movie's cult following . 

one day , an exterminator named zed ( sean connery ) , sneaks into zardoz's flying stone , pushes frayn out , and goes back to the vortex . 

once there , the immortals label him a "" brutal "" and study him like a lab rat , taking great , perverse care in exploring his sexuality , which is a mystery to them . 

they seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection , and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily-clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up . 

i say "" hilarious "" because that is exactly what "" zardoz "" is . 

it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so ; he made this film with the straightest of faces , although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward , he didn't get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming . 

just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles - he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper , a mane of hair braided halfway down his back , a wyatt earp-style handlebar mustache , and a pair of thigh-high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker . 

boorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of "" deliverance , "" which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green-light this effort . 

he attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera , including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth ( "" 2001 "" ) , whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in "" zardoz "" besides the inadvertent humor . 

sean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971 , and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace . 

he got exactly that in "" zardoz , "" and it's a wonder it didn't end his career . 

i'm sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements . 

is it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life ? 

is it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing ? 

or is it a social statement , something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates ? 

karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary . 

come to think of it , maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip . 

people high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy . 
"
"i have to say it . 

tim burton's retelling of planet of the apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys . 

ok , that's off my chest . 

no more monkey puns , i promise . 

seriously , though , planet of the apes is one rip-roarin' summer outing , filled with thrills , action , adventure , wit and bits of funny ( dare i say , monkey ) business . 

i know , i know , i promised . 

and for those film buffs who are fond of the original , burton's version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie . 

mark wahlberg stars as capt . leo davidson , a deep-space pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic field and hurled into the future . 

he crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted , captured and sold into slavery . 

despite being darker than the original , burton's film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious . 

some of the movie's flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically burton : an organ-grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed . 

then there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter . 

the seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty : "" one thing you don't want in your house is a human teen-ager , "" he says . 

you don't have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement . 

touches such as these are what stamps this movie with burton's brand . 

lines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout : the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simian's foot to try righting himself are : "" take your stinking hand off of me , you damned , dirty human . "" 

anyone familiar with the first version of the film will , of course , recognize the irony in that piece of dialogue . 

another of burton's in-jokes is to have charlton heston , star of the original , play the chimpanzee father of tim roth's gen . thade . 

the young chimp goes to visit his dying father . 

both have one thing in common , a hatred of humans . 

with his dying breath , the elder spews out his vile : "" damn them , damn them all to hell , "" he says before expiring . 

that is the famous line heston's taylor shouted at the conclusion of the original after discovering the planet's terrible secret . 

the performances throughout are top-notch . 

wahlberg plays davidson not as some gung-ho hero , but as a confused and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return home . 

he is reluctant to lead the human rebellion ; his only objective being to find a way off this upside-down planet . 

this hesitation is what makes his character believable and vulnerable . 

roth is ferocious , cunning , cruel and savage as the fascist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity . 

he leaps and bounds as if he had springs on his feet . 

it is a masterful turn . 

helena bonham carter is ari , the chimp who believes that apes and humans can live in peace and as equals . 

hers is a smart , compassionate characterization . 

michael clarke duncan is big and brutal as attar the gorilla aid to thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken . 

a fine comic outing is given by paul giamatti as limbo , the ape slave trader making a living off the misery of the humans he captures . 

as the battle between apes and humans looms , the cowardly limbo pleads , "" can't we all just get along , "" echoing the words of rodney king . 

much of the success of planet of the apes goes to burton's technical crew , especially production designer rick heinrichs and the legendary rick baker who created the ape makeup . 

burton's musical collaborator , danny elfman , provides another fine score , though it is not as memorable as his work on batman or sleepy hollow . 

the movie's only letdown comes at the very end where burton tries to outshock the finale from the 1968 original . 

he comes close , but falls short . 

otherwise , planet of the apes is what a summer movie should be : an amusement park ride filled with lots of action , stunts and a few laughs . 

this is one feature in which the expectations lived up to the pre-release hype .

"gere , willis , poitier chase each other around the world 

the jackal a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman 

when the soviet union imploded , the western countries lost their shadow . 

with the united states friendly with the russians , we no longer had an entity to blame for the world's problems . 

this showed up in hollywood films as the communist government was no longer the easy bad guy . 

it's time to rejoice because we've found our new villain . 

now it's no longer the russian government who sends killers out into foreign lands , it's the russian _mafia_ . 

a perfect solution , it combines the dread of organized crime and the still-present uneasiness with the former eastern block countries . 

best of all , the villains are still foreigners : fear of the other always plays best . 

so it is a crime lord in moscow that sends legendary hitman the jackal ( bruce willis ) to assassinate a highly placed us government figure in retaliation for the death of his brother during a nightclub raid . 

the fbi is at a loss as to how to protect the target from someone they're not sure even exists . 

coming to their rescue is former ira operative declan mulqueen ( richard gere ) who is temporarily released from prison to assist fbi agent carter preston ( sidney poitier ) and russian major valentina koslova ( diane venora ) . 

mulqueen's ex-girlfriend basque terrorist isabella ( mathilda may ) is the only person who has seen the elusive jackal . 

 ( presumably there is an exclusive international terrorist club somewhere where the three met . ) 

the film follows two parallel tracks as the jackal prepares for his $70 million hit and mulqueen attempts to locate him while preston makes sure that the irishman doesn't slip away . 

crossing numerous borders and donning various disguises for both himself and his mini-van , the killer is always one step ahead of his pursuers . 

being very loosely based on the same book the 1973 thriller "" the day of the jackal "" , comparison between the two films is inevitable . 

there is no doubt that the original is the better movie , playing the story for suspense rather than the current action/adventure . 

as a mystery , "" the jackal "" has enough holes in it to ruin the tale , but if you can accept it for what it is , there's entertainment to be had . 

holes ? let's see ? a pivotal clue for mulqueen is so obscure that he must possess psychic powers to pick it up . 

for a 20-year veteran that can command the big bucks , the jackal is an incredibly poor shot . 

the final scene between gere and willis occurs in a location that should be mobbed with police , but it's just the two of them . 

willis' disguises usually look like bruce willis and are just as interesting as val kilmer's in "" the saint "" . 

 ( and lest you misunderstand , that's not a compliment . ) 

but the three stars are fun to watch . 

it's good to see gere in something other than a business suit . 

willis has a mixed history in picking projects , but his characters are always watchable . 

poitier is by far the superior actor , but has limited screen time . 

the problems in logic are flaws , but don't ruin the experience . 

occasionally there are movies that transcend their blemishes . 

this is one of them .

"the truman show ( paramount pictures ) running time : 1 hour 42 minutes starring jim carrey and ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait , jim carrey's dramatic debut finally makes it to the big screen . 

in case you've been asleep for the last few months , the plot centres on truman burbank ( carrey ) who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven . 

his life seems so perfect , however , because it's controlled by christoff ( harris ) creator of the truman show , the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of . 

that's right , burbank's life is being broadcast live to the american public , and seahaven and all it's inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage . 

the film takes the jerry springer format one step too far . . . 

with an idea so different , it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator . 

luckily , the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages , yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie . 

talking of carrey , he's perfect in this movie , enjoying the best role in his career . 

his character is a re-inforced stanley ipkiss from the mask ( 1994 ) and is completely suited to carrey's persona . 

he occasionally falls into ace ventura mode , shrieking and being silly , but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey . 

he's not completely dramatic like the film promises , however . 

ed harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff , the megalomaniac creator of the show . 

quiet and well spoken , he burns an image into the viewer . 

unfortunately , he's barely in the film , and for the first hour dosen't appear at all ! 

also disappointing is natascha mcelhone's character sylvia . 

she plays the role well , but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her . 

the supporting cast is excellent , and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect , so perfect it's creepy . 

the philip glass soundtrack is also superb , and is used to great effect during the film . 

peter weir keeps the film going , clearly having fun . 

the film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society and green card . 

although it is slightly slow to begin with , about half an hour into film the pace really picks up , and when christoff is introduced fully the film is on a roll . 

sadly , though , the film is practically over when the film is in full steam . 

also , concerning the ending , it is slightly too ambiguous , which was disappointing . 

the screenwriter , andrew niccol , who bought us gattaca ( 1997 ) delivers an entertaining script , and manages to keep the plot in trim . 

while christoff's plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly , they never go over the line , which would have been easy for niccol to do . 

also , there's some funny gags involving product placement and the people who watch the show . 

overall , the truman show is excellent entertainment . 

certainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces , it should be viewed by everyone . 

it offers something to every member of the audience , and you would almost certainly not come out disappointed . 

overall rating= 

review by david wilcock ? 1998 

 "" you know , for kids "" - norville barnes 
"
"capsule : bleak and point-blank -- just the way it should be . 

makes its case with cold-blooded precision and intelligence . 

 "" serial killer chic "" is a relatively new entry to the cultural vocabulary , and one of the more stomach-turning ones . 

i've never found someone automatically admirable or even interesting because they killed creatively or in great numbers , and because of that i had apprehensions about seeing henry . 

i wasn't sure i wanted to see the story of multiple murderer henry lee lucas portrayed as some kind of nihilistic hero/antihero . 

thankfully , that's not the way henry works . 

the director , john mcnaughton , took a small budget and a gallery of actor friends and created a chilling and intelligent piece of work . 

it doesn't provide cheap-jack explanations for henry's behavior : it shows him up for what he is , an unrepentant and un-idolizable man who killed when the mood struck him . 

at the film's opening , henry's friend ottis toole has a sister , who comes by to stay while she tries to find work in chicago . 

in a viciously riveting scene , he admits matter-of-factly to having murdered his own mother , and she covers his hand with hers . 

they are damned together from that moment on . 

henry and ottis eventually begin to kill for fun . 

the movie is especially good at showing how they seem to have drifted casually into it : there's a scene where the two go to buy a new tv . 

the pawnbroker they talk to goads henry with ugly words , and henry responds by stabbing the man to death with a soldering iron . 

no preface -- it smashes into us as suddenly as it does the broker . 

in a scene which many damned the movie for , unseen , they steal a video camera and film the murder of a whole household , playing it back over and over again for their own enjoyment . 

the movie itself , however , does not glorify the killings , but shows instead that henry feels no joy at his work , only irritation . 

henry succeeds thanks to excellent writing and direction as well as acting . 

michael rooker is credible as henry from the first frame , just standing there , and the rest of the cast works by being unaffected and casual as well . 

the producers had originally comissioned a slasher film from mcnaughton , but he decided to give them something more memorable , and consequently the film nearly didn't see release . 

the film does not glorify or justify -- it just shows us , with unflinching coldness , what henry was . 

i'm hard pressed to see how anyone can see this and consider henry any kind of "" victim "" or "" hero "" . 

then again , probably , so would henry . 
"
"despite its exceedingly well-done visual effects , 1995's original species was one big hunk of sci-fi cheese , from the writing to the feeble performances . 

so , coming from such b-grade roots , its sequel's stunning ineptitude is not terribly surprising , yet at the same time it is . 

it would not have been difficult at all for the people behind species ii to top the hokey original , yet they have somehow managed to fabricate something just as bad , if not even worse . 

something is clearly amiss when the back door left open for a sequel in species--a sewer rat becomes not quite of this earth after eating a body part from the exploded alien/human hybrid sil--is never entered into ( perhaps that was left for species iii--though i'm not giving away anything when i say that this installment has an open back door of its own ) . 

the alien fun and games begin this time when a three-person astronaut crew returning from mars inadvertently carries within their soil samples deadly alien dna that eventually infects the mission captain , patrick ross ( justin lazard , late of cbs's short-lived soap of a few years back , central park west/cpw ) . 

this alien dna is not identical to that which created the original film's sil , but it's close enough , and upon arrival on earth patrick is mating like crazy , engaging in bloody sex with just about every woman he can find . 

meanwhile , scientist dr . laura baker ( the returning marg helgenberger ) has created a clone of sil named eve ( natasha henstridge again ) for research purposes . 

it doesn't take long for eve to sense another alien presence , which send her libido into hyperdrive . 

it's up to laura and her former partner , bounty hunter press lennox ( michael madsen , another returnee ) ; and patrick's uninfected shipmate dennis gamble ( mykelti williamson ) to find patrick before the in-heat eve does . 

 "" this isn't the x-files , goddammit ! "" 

exclaims one character in the early going . 

in terms of quality , he's absolutely right , but he's also wrong . 

the new alien first appears as an otherworldly oozing sludge that causes patrick's pupils to dilate once he's infected . 

looks and sounds an awful lot like the x-files's "" black cancer "" to me . 

but that's not the only source director peter medak and writer chris brancato steal from . 

species was already a ripoff of alien , but medak makes the cribbing much more blatant than the original's director , roger donaldson , did . 

human patrick is given a tongue that also has a tongue within itself , and his alien form more closely resembles the alien than eve's alien body ( which ironically was designed by alien designer h . r . giger ) . 

a large alien hive that our heros douse with a substance fired from large guns ? 

aliens sans flamethrowers . 

the visual effects were by far the best thing about species , and the sequel's effects crew at steve johnson's xfx inc . keeps that high-quality tradition alive ; no cheap-looking lost in space cgi here . 

after the effects , the original's best asset was the fresh presence of henstridge . 

however , medak and brancato have no idea what exactly to do with her for this installment . 

at one point she's called on to play alien "" empath "" ? la forest whitaker in the original , but for most of the duration she's holed up in a glass cell . 

by the time the big breakout so prominently featured in the trailer actually takes place , the film is well into its home stretch . 

so the rest of the time we are treated to patrick , played with little zest by lazard . 

one problem with the first film was that the deadly , horny , but innocent-at-heart sil was too sympathetic ; no such problem with patrick , who comes off as a cocky pretty boy before the alien takes control . 

the rest of the cast also fails to add much , but the writing can be faulted for that . 

helgenberger and madsen go through the motions , but they are already hampered by the clich ? d development that somewhere between the two films , the once-linked laura and press stopped getting along . 

williamson suffers the worst indignity . 

he tries his best to enliven the token african-american role , but how can anyone recite insulting , derivative lines such as "" i'm gonna get african on someone's ass "" and not appear ridiculous ? 

but species ii's worst crime is being a thoroughly uninteresting piece of work . 

at least the original featured plenty to laugh at--unaccountably awful performances by the otherwise fine actors ben kingsley and whitaker , and the sight of helgenberger's character performing fellatio on madsen's , for a start . 

but the filmmakers do not display any discernable effort at all , let alone the misguided effort that is required for something to reach the camp level . 

for all the blood and gore , nudity , and sex thrown in , species ii is , quite simply , a vapid bore . 
"
"the above is dialogue from this film , taken almost completely in context , and not jazzed up a bit to make it more inept than it is . 

it is spoken between two of the protagonists somewhere in the film , and basically serves as a perfect example of what this film is about , especially if you realize that this exchange is meant to be taken seriously . 

mr . gregg "" i'm-having-a-mid-life-crisis "" araki , the writer and director of this film , wants to show how important teenagers are , and wants to show how they feel in such a horrible , horrible world . 

and how does he show it ? 

by really cheap surrealism , and moronic exchanges like this . 

oh , and it gets better . 

a similar bit of dialogue is said in the middle of , oh i dunno , the fiftieth sex scene in this film ( i'm not counting the several masturbation scenes ) . 

in it , one of the protagonists is humping away on top of another , and he says to her something along the lines of "" do you ever wonder what life is all about ? "" 

sorry , man : foreplay takes place before the act of coitus . 

of course , what do you expect : the film was written and directed by a guy who can't even spell his first name right ( yes , i know it's a cheap joke , but it had to be done ) . 

 "" the doom generation "" is advertised as a road trip movie about people who go around killing others who attack them , and also as another "" teen angst "" film ( one of the slogans is "" teen is a four-letter word "" - hardy har har ) . 

it's a film about two angsty teens - amy blue ( rose macgowan , who would later play the buxom tatum in "" scream "" ) and jordon white ( james duval , who would go on to play randy quaid's son in "" independence day "" ) - who pick up an angsty homicidal maniac , xavier red ( jonathan schaech , who would go on to play the angsty lead guitarist in "" that thing you do ! "" 

- and by the way , do you get the symbolism ? 

red , white , and blue ? 

huh ? 

huh ? ) , and go on a road trip where three things happen , in no order : 1 ) they have sex ; 2 ) they run into weird people ; 3 ) they kill them . 

the film is basically a remix of a bunch of other far superior films . 

gregg araki obviously has seen such films as "" easy rider , "" "" natural born killers , "" and "" kalifornia , "" and tries to borrow elements from all these films and make something which is like a pop culture reference guide . 

but what he forgets is these films either represented something that this film does not , or that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out of them to make them deeper . 

 "" the doom generation "" doesn't want to do this ; it just wants to show everything in a surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level . 

he wants to show everything in a weird manner , and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about . 

here's one scene , an earlier scene in the film : amy and jordan go into a quick-e mart type place to get food and other stuff . 

amy is smoking , and the clerk , an asian man mind you ( i love how racist this film is , i really do ) , tells her to put it out . 

she tells him to fuck off or something to that note . 

he points a shotgun at her , and she puts it out reluctantly . 

jordan makes two hot dogs , and takes them to the counter . 

the cash register rings up "" 6 . 66 "" 

 ( oh , and this symbolism doesn't stop here ) . 

jordan checks for his wallet but it's really in the car . 

he asks amy for it , but she left her wallet in the car as well . 

the clerk brings out his shotgun again and asks for the money . 

they say they don't have it . 

he gets ready to kill them , but then xavier , who they ditched in the middle of nowhere a scene before , pops out of nowhere , fights with the clerk , and ends with him blowing the clerk's head clean off ( clean wound , mind you ) . 

the head is shown flying through the air , and lands in a fryer , where it begins to scream . 

i don't really object to this kind of sick violence , but this scene is in the film for one reason and one reason only : to gross you out . 

araki thinks that if he takes everything to the extreme , he'll make some kind of art . 

wrong . 

it takes a kind of resistance to make gore art . 

when george romero made "" dawn of the dead , "" a very gory flick even for today , he had control over everything and still was able to make everything sick . 

same goes for peter jackson's disgustingly gory "" dead alive , "" which features a 30 minute long fest of blood , guts , dismemberments , flesh chewing , and other assorted stuff , all ending with a guy with a lawn mower strapped to his body , taking out all sorts of zombies . 

it was sick , but it was also satirical , and controled . 

a scene like this has no purpose in the film , and it sticks out from everything else that happens . 

here's a couple other scenes : jordan and amy have sex in a bath tub and xavier watches , masturbates , and then licks the semen from his hand ; xavier and amy have sex and jordan watches from the window , masturbates , and falls backwards ; a man attacks the trio , and is stabbed in the crotch by a giant sword ( put there just so this could happen ) ; a fast food employee stalks the trio , and his arm is shot off by xavier ; and various other annoyances . 

also , look for about a million camoes from a wide assortment of people , who probably didn't really know what they were getting into when they signed up to do it ( just like peter o'toole , helen mirren , malcolm macdowell , and john gielgud probably didn't when they signed to be in "" caligula "" ) . 

people such as indie actors parker posey and nicky katt , alternative rock stars skinny puppy and perry farrel , hollywood madam heidi fleiss , christopher "" peter brady "" mcknight , amanda bearse , and margaret cho all grace the screen for a matter of seconds , then disappear so that we can return to the annoying main plot line . 

why are they here ? 

so that we can all point to them and say "" hey , look it's ( fill in the blank ) ! 

wow ! "" 

gimme a break . 

the film's meaning is pretty easy to detect : that , you know , teens are so precious , and the world is such a horrible place , that when the two entities collide , there's a giant explosion of horrific violence . 

otherwise defined as "" teen angst , "" or the belief that being a teenager is a horrible thing and that the world is too bad for you . 

look , i'm 19 years old . 

i went through a very brief teen angst thing which curiously lasted about as long as my taste in nirvana did . 

i've since moved on to "" i don't really know what to do with my life "" phase , but the teen angst phase is something which is so annoyingly sophomoric and ignorant that any film that thinks they're dealing with it on any kind of serious level is just beating the wrong horse . 

part of being a teen is experimenting , and testing the waters . 

it's not whining about how awful parents are , and purposely feeling dispondent . 

this is what the characters in this film do , and the film wants to show how they're these great people who are being punished by the world because they're teenagers , and how they try to defend themselves but can't totally overcome them . 

it's not their fault they kill people ; it's the world's ! 

what they really need is a reality check . 

the world is a bad place , and teenagers can be easily harmed because they are experimenting . 

but part of it is taking everything that happens to you and learning from it . 

the film thinks that teenagers are basically doomed , and there's nothing they can do about it . 

hence the title . 

not only does it have bad fallacy , but it can't even express this in an intelligent and coherent manner . 

everything's overly surreal , and all we get are scenes of graphic violence and graphic sex . 

how does xavier licking semen off his hand express teen angst ? 

how does a talking decapitated head show that teens are dispondent because the world makes them this way ? 

and why does the film constantly go back to the teen angst issue of the film ? 

if araki had any kind of competence in writing or direction , he'd show them for what they really are . 

and if he didn't want the satirical approach , he'd show the real problems with the world . 

and if you still don't think that "" the doom generation "" is incompetent on every single possible level it could be , take the acting . 

rose macgowan is horrible . 

yes , she proved herself talented in "" scream , "" but she's so bad in "" the doom generation "" that if i had not seen her in "" scream , "" i would have christened her one of the worst actresses working in films today . 

her entire performance is one-note ( bitchy ) , and the one scene where she cries over a dead animal is so forced that it's laughable . 

equally bad is jonathan schaech , who wants to be the slacker serial killer : someone who doesn't have any remorse because emotions cause some kind of strain . 

his performance is annoying as hell , and granted , he was better in "" that thing you do ! "" 

and then there's james duval . 

let's just say he makes keanu reeves look like brando . 

he has the same kind of slacker stuttering , only much much much worse , and every line he says is so bad that i have now deemed him "" least talented actor in the world . "" 

i have seen lots of bad actors , but james duval has got to be the worst . 

or at least somewhere up there . 

here's another example of a bad scene , if you're still not convinced : the film opens up in a club where they're playing nine inch nail's most banal song , "" heresy "" ( example of the lines : "" god is dead/and no one cares/if there is a hell/i'll see you there "" ) , and as the song plays , and red strobe lights show the patrons dancing , the film pans over to amy , just standing there , looking dispondent . 

the film closes in on her , she looks right at the camera and says "" fuck . "" 

no explanation of this should be necessary . 

and finally , a note to gregg : grow up . 

really . 

move out of your parent's basement , read something other than salinger , and get a day job . 

and don't quit it .

"i didn't come into city of angels expecting greatness . 

i've never seen wim wenders' wings of desire , the classic movie upon which city is loosely based . 

then again , i have seen enough stories which are based upon a similar plot device , with the little mermaid ( both the disney version and the original folktale ) being among them , that i had some high expectations about the possible power such a story of impossible love can hold . 

unfortunately , city of angels ended up fulfilling few of them . 

the plot , for those that couldn't tell from the previews , revolves around the angel seth , played with an almost creepy intensity by nicolas cage , who , in the midst of his angelic duties , falls in love with a heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan in her most endearing performance since when harry met sally ) . 

of course , his being an angel prevents him from doing much about his love except appearing at random times to talk to her , watch her buy groceries , only to disappear in the blink of an eye . 

their love must remain unrequited unless seth decides to make the ultimate sacrifice and become human . 

using this framework as a jumping-off point , the movie attempts to veer through some heavy philosophical ruminations on the nature of desire , the joys of being human , and the definition of perfection . 

the first half of the movie succeeds on most points . 

cage excellently plays the eminently difficult role of an angel who doesn't know feelings so can't really express , preventing the character of seth from getting boring despite his limited repertoire of intent looks and hang-dog expressions . 

unfortunately , cage takes the intensity too far sometimes , and then seth comes across as more creepy than sensitive . 

as maggie , ryan manages to be convincing as a heart surgeon who has trouble coming to terms with her having lost a patient on the operating table despite having done everything right . 

her beauty , unlike her unbearable cuteness in french kiss , is mature , intelligent , and winning . 

likewise , some interesting ideas float around at the beginning of the film . 

when the camera pans through traffic jams and libraries and we get to hear the thoughts of the random people who flash across the screen , the audience experiences a little of what it must be like to be an angel . 

the beautiful camera work , shooting down onto the hectic world of los angeles from the improbable perches of the angels , also gives us a sense of the unique wonder angels feel . 

the film begins to lose its way , though , when the focus tightens more and more on seth and maggie . 

the grand , angelic perspective gets lost , except for some idly tossed lines about the incredible beauty of the world through an angel's eyes . 

the movie devolves into an examination of how seth can't feel the world or , more importantly , he can't feel maggie : he can't smell her hair , feel her touch , or taste the pears she eats . 

this change in focus attempts to capture the audience in seth's intense longing , but in doing so , the conflict disappears . 

if he wants maggie so badly , then why doesn't her just make the leap and become human ? 

after all , what's so great about being an angel ? 

sure , you get to sit on marlboro signs , but what's that compared to getting to be with meg ryan ? 

and from there , once the yearning has been established and the romantic denouement must occur , it's all downhill . 

the philosophy becomes heavy-handed , the dialogue pedestrian when it tries to be deep , and the plot twists simply attempt to yank a few more tears into the audience's hankie . 

it's the last thirty minutes of the movie , then , that wrecks the film . 

i feel like the writer , by pulling out all the melodramatic stops , has robbed me of what could have been a genuinely powerful movie experience on both the romantic and the philosophical level . 

i came out feeling robbed , seeing so much possibility in a film becoming nothing . 

i could go on longer , but i don't want to "" ruin "" the end by revealing any of the cheap plot devices the film relies on . 

city of angels , then , is a paradox . 

it's a well-acted ( particularly look for dennis franz cutting against type-casting as a happy-go-lucky fallen angel ) , well-filmed , and based on a wonderful idea . 

all these possibilities , though , are what make the film so unredeemable when the closing credits come up .

"this reviewer is ignorant of what hands were responsible for delivering the original version of the abyss in 1989 . 

whether it was the meddling of studio executives , or the work of writer/director james cameron himself , the original cut of this underwater sci-fi thriller was entertaining enough but also quite seriously flawed . 

the main problem was fairly simple : the film's climax was unworthy of its build-up . 

someone at 20th century fox - and no doubt cameron himself - must have agreed , because in 1993 came the theatrical release of the abyss : special edition . 

now available on video , it seems timely to re-evaluate what , in its newly revamped state , is now a near-masterpiece despite its borrowings from films like 2010 : odyssey two , alien and close encounters of third kind . 

the plot is thus . 

we meet the crew of an experimental underwater mobile oil rig designed by the hard-nosed lindsay ( mastrantonio ) and captained by her soon-to-be-divorced husband bud ( ed harris ) . 

the rig and its crew are diverted from their normal duties when the navy seeks their help in investigating the mysterious sinking of a u . s . nuclear submarine . 

requiring a dive part-way down a three mile deep trench , three navy divers arrive to command the operation , led by the edgy lieutenant coffey ( biehn ) . 

but a series of strange sightings soon convinces at least one member of the civilian crew that whoever or whatever they're dealing with , as she memorably puts it , "" aren't speaking russian "" . 

meanwhile on the surface a hurricane is brewing and , even worse , a series of incidents around cuba involving russians ships and an increasingly nervous u . s . navy sets off an international crisis of possible catastrophic proportions . 

this crisis is mirrored in the confines of the now isolated underwater rig , with the trigger-happy and increasingly paranoid lieutenant coffey at odds with the crew about how do deal with the mysterious goings-on around them . 

the human drama is often riveting , with the principal players performing with an intensity that recalls the fine ensemble acting in cameron's aliens . 

the stunts , hardware , special effects and underwater cinematography are all outstanding . 

and so they should be : cameron's technical credentials are well established . 

but what ultimately makes the film so gripping is three intersecting plot strands : 1 ) the tension between old sparring partners lindsay and ex-hubby bud ; 2 ) the war of wills between the civilian crew and the navy divers as a series of escalating crisis' befall them ; and 3 ) the slowly unfolding revelation of what lies at the bottom of the three mile deep abyss . 

the abyss : special edition is an improvement on the original film in two major respects . 

one is that it further fleshes out the relationship between bud and lindsay , a relationship at times touching , at others incredibly intense and volatile . 

the second improvement is the restoration of some absolutely crucial scenes towards the film's end , when the aliens demonstrate their control over water with a terrifying and extraordinary display of power to a world on the brink of nuclear war . 

with the inclusion of these startling scenes , the story's climax is now given real weight . 

why on earth were they left out of the original ? 

this reviewer finds it utterly incomprehensible . 

so then , we have 25 minutes of additional footage that's turned a decent underwater thriller into something quite magnificent . 

i say "" quite "" because some flaws do remain . 

the most grating is several moments of corny hollywood schmaltz - some new , some old - that may well have you reaching for the barf bag . 

nonetheless , the abyss : special edition now stands this somewhat maligned film among james cameron's greatest achievements , alongside aliens and terminator 2 . see it and be moved , gripped and spellbound .

"back in 1998 dreamworks unveiled their first computer animated movie "" antz "" . 

the film was critically acclaimed , and went on to gross almost $100m dollars at the domestic box office . 

again in 1998 they released their traditional animated film "" the prince of egypt "" and it named an instant classic , and became a huge hit as well . 

on a winning streak , they released "" the road to el dorado "" and it wasn't as big as they hoped , but still did ok , then they had the fantastic "" chicken run "" in the summer . 

now in 2001 dreamworks has released what i can safely name , one of the top five best animated films . 

shrek ( mike myers ) is about a loving , green ogre who lives in the woods of duloc by himself . 

surrounded by fairy tale characters , he hopes somehow he would escape from everyone . 

the ruler of duloc is the short , heartless lord farquaad ( john lithgow ) , who is offering a reward to all the fairy tale creatures , if they are captured and arrested . 

of course many of the owners turn them in for gold and silver , but one of those creatures is donkey ( eddie murphy ) . 

a regular donkey , except he talks and has a definite attitude , after his owner tries to disown him , he escapes into the woods , and runs into shrek . 

lord farquaad however , has different plans and makes all the fairy tale creatures in the woods near shrek's house . 

to get his property back , and his life back shrek must rescue princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) so lord farquaad can be a king . 

shrek wants his property back , but he never thought he would fall in love with princess fiona . 

 "" shrek "" is such an amazing film , that while watching it you can't help but just smile the entire time and wonder why that other production company can't make movies like this . 

the animated graphics are so great , that they look every bit of realistic . 

i saw previews for this film all last year , and i thought to myself wow , what a great movie this will be . 

i must say i was not disappointed at all , and the film is the best of 2001 so far , and will go down on my best of 2001 list at the end of the year . 

the voice talents are brilliant as well , with the comic genius mike myers . 

in the past he has been a wayne , an austin , and a person married to an ax murderer . 

now he is shrek , not only does he do the voice talent . . . but he is shrek . 

with his irish accent , and he lovable personality , shrek becomes a friend to the audience and warms your heart . 

eddie murphy who showed his voice talent in 1998s "" mulan "" does another bang up job here , and he is the comic relief in the film . 

the tones of his voice , the lines he utters , and the jokes he gives , he even outdoes the comic genius of robin williams in "" aladdin "" . 

the always beautiful cameron diaz gives the voice of princess fiona and she does a great job as well . 

she is very funny , and her character fits her to a t . of course the best supporting voice is john lithgow , who is personally one of my favorite actors . 

he as the bad guy lord farquaad does a great job in being both sinister and funny at the same time . 

at times i was so amazed by the computer graphics , that you can't help but just start looking at backgrounds . 

there is many hidden jokes in the film , and even reflections of light on the screen like a camera . 

 "" shrek "" is a definite kid film , but not just a kid film for it is a film for the entire family to enjoy . 

there are many adult jokes in the film that the kids won't get , but the parents will be laughing . 

believe me though , everyone will be laughing the entire way through . 

in the end , "" shrek "" gives a very important message to it's audience to enjoy and be who you are . 

everybody out there is beautiful in their own way , even though it may be inside . 

there's not many words that can praise "" shrek "" enough , but my words to you is to stop what you are doing and see this movie now .

"elizabeth is a potent historical drama set in england in the mid-1500s . 

it is a time when stately royal ceremonies are as commonplace as public burnings . 

internally , the catholics wage war against the protestants . 

meanwhile , spain , scotland and france strategize their next moves in the struggle for power . 

little does england know that a young woman named elizabeth ( cate blanchett ) will be their greatest hope for survival . 

the film charts elizabeth's tumultuous struggle to gain true power over her kingdom . 

as a protestant , she is the last person any of the catholic royalty would want to be queen . 

but her half-sister queen mary ( kathy burke ) , deathly ill and unable to conceive a child , pleas with elizabeth to take over the throne . 

mary gives her her blessing on only one condition : that elizabeth renounce her faith and uphold the teachings of catholicism across the land . 

once declared queen , elizabeth immediately finds herself under assault , both by her own subjects ( including the duke of norfolk , played with steely-eyed grace by christopher eccleston ) and by forces abroad . 

slowly but surely , the neophyte ruler takes england by its reigns and forges a new path for her kingdom . 

elizabeth is surrounded by a keenly drawn cadre of subjects and advisers . 

her closest ally is the mysterious sir francis walsingham ( geoffrey rush , in a perfectly subtle performance ) . 

also on her side is sir william cecil ( sir richard attenborough ) , her well-meaning but misguided chief adviser . 

with few people she can trust , elizabeth must prove her self-worth any way she can , even if it means being the iron-fisted ruler she secretly despises . 

blanchett deserves an oscar for her performance as elizabeth . 

she portrays the young queen with just the right balance of gawky self-consciousness and shrewd charisma . 

though not a classical beauty , blanchett is able to entrance the viewer with just a coy smile or an impish smirk . 

she is at home with her character's playful tendencies , particularly in one scene where elizabeth dances unabashedly with childhood friend and lover lord robert dudley ( joseph fiennes ) . 

whether fending off unctuous suitors or "" playing "" the houses in court , blanchett's elizabeth radiates a confidence which impossible to dislike . 

almost as interesting as the character of elizabeth are shekhar kapur's visual delights . 

he and cinematographer remi adefarasin have crafted a film with a rich color palette that is a feast for the eyes . 

rolling green hills , extravagant ceremonial galas , dark and foreboding corridors -- all are depicted with a real sense of artistic appreciation . 

the castles and cathedrals of europe have rarely been doted on so lovingly as they are here . 

though writer michael hirst's script gets a little murky at times , and his injections of humor get a little overplayed , elizabeth pulses with the right amount of dramatic and cinematic verve to make it just deserving of a theatrical viewing . 

as a whole , the story survives because elizabeth's struggle is one which deserves attention . 

by the time she makes her shocking ( but very sensible ) final declaration , we're ready to bow to elizabeth as our own queen .

"let's face it : the $100 million-plus smash that was "" goldeneye "" was not a good film by any means , and as a bond movie was only marginally better than , say , "" a view to a kill "" or either of the timothy dalton pictures , by virtue of nice pacing . 

but it did revive the series , and granted the producers some new directions in which to take the it ( ie . 

the new "" m "" is a woman ) . 

 "" tomorrow never dies "" is the picture "" goldeneye "" should have been ; it's also the most entertaining bond outing since "" the spy who loved me "" . 

the new picture opens with china considering war with britain after a standard military operation is misconstrued as a hostile threat from an english submarine . 

as an attack occurs , the front-page headline is already being prepared , courtesy of carver media . 

carver ( pryce ) the man is a deluded magnate , a sort of hybrid of ted turner , bill gates , and peter sellars' german scientist from "" dr . 

strangelove "" ( physically , pryce even recalls sellars in his kubrick days ) . 

it's up to james bond to take him down , with assistance , of course , from a wealth of gadgets ( including a multi-purpose cell phone ) , and beautiful women . 

enter michelle yeoh , fresh from "" supercop "" , as a chinese secret agent with her own agenda ; with effortless grace , she cat burgles , dispatches baddies seemingly with the ease of preparing pasta , and refuses the advances of our philandering hero . 

they make a great team . 

 "" tomorrow never dies "" is a surprisingly entertaining and efficient film , given that at the helm is none other than the director of "" turner & hooch "" . 

spottiswoode has crafted some breathtaking set pieces , each much more intricate and impressive than , for instance , the tank scene in "" goldeneye "" . 

moreover , brosnan has at last settled into the role some feel he was born to play ; last time out , the fate of the franchise rested on his shoulders , and there was noticeable discomfort in his body language . 

returned in brosnan's eyes has some of the playfulness he demonstrated for so many years on tv's "" remington steele "" , as has his deadpan wit . 

and though carver's motives are muddy ( when carver explains that "" genius is insanity with some success "" , screenwriter fierstein is taking a lazy shortcut ) , pryce makes an agreeable , memorable villain . 

in the future , they should pursue actors as talented and experienced as pryce to breathe life into these cardboard figures . 

there a few too many explosions in "" tomorrow never dies "" , perhaps so many they qualify as dialogue . 

and it could have used a sharper script , though i was amused by the double entendres , none of which i will reveal here . 

as it stands , the plot suffers many holes ( i'm not taking about implausibilities ) , and the dialogue tends towards the hackneyed . 

now that the elements are in place : modern special effects and stunt work , cool pierce brosnan , kickass female allies . . . 

it's time to put them to use in something truly special . 

there's no mistaking , however , that "" tomorrow never dies "" is ideal holiday escapism , and for the first time in perhaps years , you'll walk out wanting more bond movies .

"no matter what you suspect , this isn't your usual action thriller . 

the usual suspects is an intelligent crime mystery story from up-and-coming director bryan singer . 

it's one of those movies that , after everything is revealed rapid-fire at the end , you immediately want to rewind and watch again because earlier scenes take on a new light . 

plot twists a-go-go are what you get here -- i gave up trying to figure out the mystery of keyser soze after awhile and just sat back and waited for them to reveal it to me . 

keyser soze is a name you'll hear at least a hundred times if you watch the usual suspects and for good reason . 

it's not only the name of the mysterious ( and possibly even mythical ) crime boss in the movie , it also sums up the movie -- "" keyser soze "" in latin means "" an intelligent crime mystery story from up-and-coming director bryan singer . "" 

or maybe i shouldn't have bought a foreign-language dictionary from the same company that makes those 99-cent encyclopedias sold in supermarkets . 

at the movie's opening , a group of known criminals are brought in for a police lineup , including mcmanus ( stephen baldwin ) , keaton ( gabriel byrne ) , fenster ( benicio del toro ) , buckney ( kevin pollack ) and verbal ( kevin spacey , winner of the best supporting actor academy award{symbol 153 \ f "" times new roman "" \ s 10 \ h} for his performance in the movie ) . 

verbal is so-named because he frequently rambles on about anything or nothing . 

he also earns his name as the movie's narrator , spouting memorable lines like "" the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist "" ( although , obviously , he does exist -- what else could explain kris kross having a comeback in 1996 ? ) while being interrogated by police detective chazz palminteri ( any actor with multiple z's in their name is okay in my book ) . 

we see the story unfold as spacey retells it . 

the five felons , upon being released from the lineup , get their revenge on the police by exposing a corrupt taxi service -- whereby elite criminals pay to be smuggled through town in cop cars -- and stealing all the money and drugs in the car . 

it's a definite case of male bonding for the five criminals , who later find out they were brought together by the unseen keyser soze , who sends a minion to them with an offer they can't refuse . 

namely , they have to destroy soze's main competitors in organized crime by infiltrating a ship , shooting a bunch of people , burning all the drugs and stealing $91 million cash . 

spacey does a terrific job of bringing his seemingly unintelligent "" cripple "" character to life and baldwin , byrne , palminteri and the rest make for a good supporting cast . 

the usual suspects is one of those movies that deftly mixes scenes of violence and explosions with an underlying sense of mystery and suspense , keeping the viewer guessing until the very end -- and then still leaving a few details open for scrutiny and discussion . 

i suppose all that would be cleared up if i really had rewound the movie and watched it again instead of changing the channel and wondering in disbelief what the hell kris kross was doing on mtv . 

a different mystery , i guess , which may turn into a _murder_ mystery if that video ever comes on again . . .

"i've always been told that there are two things in life that are unavoidable - death and taxes . 

oddly , i've never given much thought to either of the two . 

maybe if i did , at least i'd stop getting collection notices from uncle sam . 

yes , let me make a resolution to devote myself to better record keeping , hold on to all my receipts , and to do what it takes to have the satisfaction that my returns are mistake-free and will keep me from incurring penalties . 

it seems that the issue of death may not be so different , at least envisioned here in this film . 

as this tender love story goes , if you do good things and have a clear conscience when you die , you ascend to a place of great peace and beauty . 

the dreams , wishes , and fantasies that you had when you were alive come true . 

for those who die with a burdened soul , however , they wind up in that other place . 

chris and annie ( a winsome robin williams and a radiant annabella sciorra ) seem like the perfect couple that deserve all that heaven has to offer . 

their love for each other is strong and their bond is undeniable . 

but tragic events eventually tear apart the fabric of annie's happiness . 

and when chris dies after a terrible car accident , she commits suicide - a tortured soul who blames herself . 

despair is perhaps the greatest sin , and she will wallow in her guilt throughout eternity . 

chris , on the other hand , has made it to heaven , and upon learning of annie's fate , he journeys to hell to find her and to try to free her from her nightmare . 

this film brims with imagination , containing a lush imagery that shows the arcadia that is heaven and the bitterness and frightfulness that is hell . 

it seems that heaven and hell could very well be a product of our fantasies or nightmares . 

it's shape and look is as infinite as our imagination . 

as chris explores his new fantastic world and discovers things both amazing and wondrous , he also begins to learn more about himself . 

certain questions baffle him at first . 

why does his home in heaven ooze with paint ? 

what is the significance of the asian stewardess ? 

why does he have an all-too-willing guide ( cuba gooding , jr . ) to help him find annie ? 

but as he slowly begins to realize the answers , it makes him stronger and gives him a greater chance to save annie . 

 "" dreams "" is both visually and tellingly beautiful . 

alas , i have one regret . 

the movie did well to gather more and more emotional speed , but the denouement was curiously unsatisfying . 

it seemed as if it was racing to some kind of great finish , but its intensity seemed to wane in its final moments . 

however , your eyes will still well up with tears and you'll find lots to savor . 

the storytelling is purposeful and well constructed . 

the journey is imaginative . 

and i was surprised by how much i enjoyed this film .

"late in down to you , the lead female character ( julia stiles ) states her greatest fear is having an "" artificial conversation "" with her boyfriend ( freddie prinze jr . ) . 

the irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out , fallen asleep , or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy . 

the film is a multi-million dollar testament to everything artificial . 

filled with characters , motivation , plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable disaster . 

prinze plays a college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles' freshman co-ed . 

at first the movie seems to be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose of out-doing the previous in how "" cute "" it can be . 

the happy couple "" psychoanalyze "" each other ; they pick out a song because , as prinze's dj mother ( lucie arnez ) explains , every couple needs a song ; he smells her shampoo ; she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know she wants to make love . 

then , in standard romantic comedy style , things fall apart . 

why ? 

well , because they have to . 

otherwise the couple can't make up and live ( presumably ) happily ever after . 

down to you exists outside the realm of normal logic . 

scenes do not connect to each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism , but this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead . 

a picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre , not only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together , or even knowing each other , but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a goat . 

the supporting characters are remarkably flat , and insultingly ridiculous as well . 

stiles' best friend ( rosario dawson ) is a pot head , prinze's roommate ( shawn hatosy ) is a girl crazy fool who can't meet women , and then there are the porn stars ( zak orth and selma blair ) . 

he is one of those famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on television , does the college lecture circuit , and stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film . 

you know , the average porn star . 

the costume epic idea gives him a reason to appear in a different ridiculous outfit everytime he's on screen , the porn angle exists just so there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes . 

she is a porn star mostly so we know she's slutty , so her very existence will make stiles jealous and prinze tempted . 

attempts at drama ( which means julia is going to cry ) include a pregnancy scare and the big break up . 

these characters are so insipid only the most forgiving viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes . 

what happened here ? 

the cast is full of likable , promising , young actors ( stiles especially seems to be going places ) . 

writer/director kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it off . 

in fact the whole film feels like a reworking of last year's extremely unpleasant the story of us , for teen audiences . 

the direction is film-school-grad obvious . 

it's stylish in a hugely self conscious way which throws in split screen , a pointless parody of "" cops , "" characters walking into the flashbacks of other characters , and a hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze and stiles where all the extras move in fast motion while the couple moves in extreme slow motion . 

plus , the whole story is told flashback style , narrated by prinze and stiles directly addressing the camera . 

this is the second film in a row ( following wing commander ) starring freddie prinze jr . which should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of she's all that . 

if he doesn't start making better choices fast his future films won't be so lucky .

i'm beginning to get fed up . 

over my four years as a critic , the thing which has kept me going is the moderate balance of films . 

the good balances the bad . 

i try to see both in equal proportions . 

but disney's mighty joe young remake marks the fourth week in which i haven't seen a truly terrible movie . 

it's a backwards machismo , i suppose , the urge to see the things which you so loathe ; but i need to see a bad film every once in a while . 

and , you know what , mighty joe young doesn't qualify . 

far from being bad , mighty joe young is actually a family fun movie . 

it's enjoyable , appropriate , cute , cuddly , and all of those other things that i've been seeing in every movie since a bug's life . 

mighty joe young tracks a 2 , 000 pound gorilla in the wilds of africa that is taken to a reserve in . . . 

california ? 

 . . . 

for safe-keeping . 

okay . 

a little unrealistic , but who ever said a kid's movie had to have the slightest hint of realism . 

the first half of the movie is a gorillas in the mist-esque hatred of poachers woman-of-the-wild motif . 

the second half is a straight up parody of king kong , awestruck onlookers and all . 

mark one down . 

i'm feeling relaxed . 

it is , as a point of fact , an extremely un-creative movie . 

but , as a vetern , i can say quite honestly that creativity doesn't count for as much as it should . 

so that saves mighty joe from my wrath , although my colleagues and cohorts and surely bashing this film at this very moment . 

this is not the film to take a girl on a date to . 

it's not the film for you . 

it's the film for you and your family . 

when you're right alongside your kid , all of the normal rights and wrongs slip away . 

the same thing happens when you watch a horror movie or an action flick . 

it becomes fun . 

all you have to do to enjoy mighty joe young is shut up and watch .

"the happy bastard's quick movie review 

me tarzan . . . you 

happy viewer . 

for a minute there , i thought i was going to be groaning over the release of disney's latest , another adaptation of a legend from the past . 

 ( remember the pathetic pocahontas ? 

yikes ! ) 

but guess what- disney , a company that's been on a roll lately with animated films , strikes again with another wonderful tale that pleases the eyes as well as the inner kid in you . 

the story is pretty basic- tarzan is left orphaned and a female gorilla who's lost her young adopts him into her group . 

as he matures into a much older man , tarzan still wonders just why he's so much different from the clan , and then arrives a hunter , a professor , and the professor's lovely daughter , jane- who meets tarzan rather quickly after getting in trouble with a group of feisty babboons . 

from there , tarzan faces tough choices- should he stay with the ones that he grew up with or go join his own kind in england ? 

the voicework here is pretty top-level . 

tony goldwyn is very convincing as the ape man ; minnie driver adds a delectable touch to the already-beautiful jane ; nigel hawthorne makes for a pretty nasty hunter voice ; rosie o' donnell keeps the laughs rolling as tarzan's best ape friend terk ; and wayne "" newman "" knight has his moments as a panicky elephant . 

the movie is superb throughout , mixing a great script with incredible computer-assisted visuals . 

when tarzan tree-surfs ( a twist that was added on top of the same ol' vine swinging- and a great one , i might add ) , the camera twists and turns , allowing the trees all around to come to life vividly . 

i couldn't believe my eyes- disney has come a long way since starting in a ballroom for beauty and the beast . 

and the music's not half bad , either . 

fortunately , there's no ridiculous singing characters here , just a great set of songs by phil collins that perfectly fit the mood . 

there's some great action sequences here as well , including a wonderfully done chase between tarzan , jane , and the aforementioned babboons . 

but , of course , it's not all action- there's a message here as well that has to do with family . 

this is easily one of disney's best animated films of the decade and it's one i can't wait to put in my home library . . . that 

is , if my vcr still works in the year 2000 .

"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . 

be forewarned . 

milos forman's first film since the ill-fated valmont , columbia's the people vs . 

larry flynt , is a vastly entertaining ( if not particularly enlightening ) biopic of hustler publisher and self-made millionaire larry flynt , who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late 1970s and early 1980s . 

the film unweaves its tale in a chronological order : we open with young and dirt-poor larry flynt and his brother jimmy , peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky . 

cut to forward in time , where the two flynt brothers , now young men , are running the struggling hustler go-go clubs in cincinnati . 

the strip clubs are in a dire financial state , and in a last-ditch effort to salvage the operations , flynt decides to go to a print shop and churn out a promotional newsletter . 

this evolved into the adult periodical _hustler_ magazine , creating larry flynt a vast financial empire , and the rest is history . 

what sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material , and who railed and preached against him - flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt - and his driven , single-minded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression , regardless of personal cost . 

the people vs . 

larry flynt also weaves in the bittersweet story of flynt's true love , althea leasure , whom he meets as a dancer in his club and later marries , and who devotedly stands alongside him throughout his trials and tribulations . 

considering the serious nature of the film's theme - the importance of the united states' first amendment - the people vs . 

larry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully light-hearted and humourous . 

much of the comedy is elicited from larry flynt's outlandish stunts at his courtroom appearances - some of his chosen apparel is hilarious - and for the most part these elements of the film work far better than some of the more dramatic points , such as an uninspiring flynt monologue set at a free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity . 

the film's focus is on the flynt's many battles over first amendment rights and freedom of speech , but the heart of the people vs . 

larry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea . 

larry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff , harsh , and overtly aggressive with his friends and colleagues , but with althea , we see his loving , affectionate side . 

there's a scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on a ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking . 

ultimately , the emotional power that the film hits at its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his battles against censors , but from the strength of flynt and althea's love for each other . 

woody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly a career-topping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt . 

harrelson plays flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness and confident stubborness to make him endearing and entirely sympathetic to the audience , and a very compelling protagonist for the film . 

courtney love plays althea leasure in a startling turn , completely raw and impulsive . 

it's a very solid performance , brash and naturalistic , and love is extremely compelling ; it's difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen , and her chemistry with harrelson is dead-on . 

edward norton , as flynt's straight , level-headed lawyer is often upstaged by his flashier co-stars in the people vs . 

larry flynt , much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged by flynt during many of the courtroom scenes , but norton shines in his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of the film . 

one can sense the frustration that norton's character feels when harrelson's free-talking flynt sabotages trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind , and this results in a heightened emotional punch when norton's isaacman has the opportunity to sway the supreme court judges . 

milos forman keeps the film moving - although it runs over two hours , it never drags - and his direction of the film is very effective , eliciting a great deal of empathy for a subject which could be construed by some as extremely sordid and unsympathetic . 

there's also a great visual technique which forman uses to indicate the passing of time in one shot , which is both clever and extremely entertaining . 

two minor quibbles with the film - it certainly seems like the people vs . 

larry flynt is in a rush to get to its main theme , with flynt battling against authorities and the system for his freedom of speech . 

consequently , the first thirty minutes of the film , introducing and setting up the characters , seem unduly rushed ; perhaps it is merely due to the fact that these characters are so interesting , but i felt it would have worked better if this route was taken in a more leisurely fashion . 

it also felt like there was a distinctive lack of insight into the inner workings of these characters - the film clearly shows what flynt , althea , isaacman , and rev . jerry faldwell did , and on a superficial level some of their motivations , but it never seemed like one could really understand the characters on a deeper level . 

for example , why larry flynt was compelled by ruth carter stapleton ( president carter's sister ) to be born-again is a mystery to me . 

then again , perhaps it was to him as well . 

these two points don't detract greatly from the film . 

the people vs . 

larry flynt is certainly among the very best studio-released films of 1996 , and works both as a ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depths to which larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free expression , and as a touching love story .

"the full monty is a whole lot of fun , its wacky , witty , and original . 

it's written and directed by relatively unknowns , simon beaufoy and peter cattaneo , who both turned up oscar nominations . 

how did this movie with a budget under 10 million gross over 175 million worldwide ? 

its been rumored that this film may be the second most profitable movie of the year ! 

and to think its about male exotic dancers , and not sinking ships . 

six steel workers who have been recently been laid off and are all looking for jobs . 

inspired by the success of a chippendale's production , gaz ( robert carlyle ) decides they should all put on a strip show to make some money quickly . 

as the six team up to put on the show of their lives , they run into a few problems . 

for instance , dave ( mark addy ) is worried about his weight , horse ( paul barber ) thinks he may be inadequate , and gerald ( tom wilkinson ) is worried about his reputation and timing . 

so when the night of the show comes , will the men be able to do the "" full monty "" ? 

as i said before this is a fun movie , and not just that its really artistically good . 

the writing and direction are great . 

the acting is appealing , all the performances have a human quality to them , so you can relate to at least one of the characters . 

the full monty received four oscar nominations including best picture . 

which left me wondering one thing , why didn't trainspotting get a best picture nomination last year ? 

while the full monty is a great lighthearted comedy , it doesn't carry the social impact of the brilliant trainspotting . 

still , the full monty is a great film , a must see !

"synopsis : al simmons , top-notch assasin with a guilty conscience , dies in a fiery explosion and goes to hell . 

making a pact with malebolgia , a chief demon there , simmons returns to earth 5 years later reborn as spawn , a general in hell's army donning a necroplasmic costume replete with knives , chains , and a morphing cape . 

sullen , wise cogliostro and flatulating , wisecracking violator vy for spawn's attention . 

comments : when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics ( where he had made a name for himself as a first-rate comic book penciller on the "" spider-man "" titles ) to join the newly-formed , creator-owned image comics , a new comic book legend was born : spawn . 

mcfarlane's "" spawn "" immediately became a commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the 1990s . 

mcfarlane created a hero who was not only original but visually intricate , allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max . 

the early "" spawn "" issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane's genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing . 

with the popularity of "" spawn "" and the success of the current warner bros . 's batman film franchise , a movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn . 

in the summer of 1997 , hence , new line cinema released spawn , a live-action film based on the groundbreaking series . 

this topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book , like me , numbed by how much spawn misses the mark . 

what happened ? 

why is spawn so bad ? 

todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo . 

i don't think , however , that his presence necessarily hurt ( or helped ) the film . 

i place the blame , in part , on the recent hollywood trend , fueled by public demand apparently , for special effects blow-out movies utilizing the latest computer technology . 

these films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else : character , plot , dialogue , etc . spawn , reflecting this trend , shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics . 

hardly a minute goes by in this film without fires , explosions , knives and chains appearing out of nowhere , glowing eyes , or constantly transforming demons . 

a lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid , don't get me wrong , but , because the script and cast aren't engaging , spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper ( the surface may capture the eye , but nothing exists underneath ) . 

spawn's translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level . 

mcfarlane's spawn was a tortured hero . 

a mercenary by trade , al simmons was nonetheless a warm man in love with the beautiful wanda . 

having died and journeyed to hell , he made a pact to return to earth to be with wanda . 

simmons , however , discovers that his memories are fragmented , his body a creepy mess , and his wife married . 

despite his sometimes violent nature , readers couldn't help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld . 

spawn attempts to show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so . 

when the characters are developed , they seem absurd rather than touching . 

the cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot ( a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat-16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world ) do not help matters . 

spawn , in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman , also unwisely spends too much time on a villain , the violator ( batman favored the joker over batman ) . 

john leguizamo , like jack nicholson in batman , receives top billing in the cast as the violator ; michael jai white ( al simmons / spawn ) is second . 

i ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the violator . 

the film , however , spends so much time on the violator's offensive antics that they grate on the nerves . 

apparently meant to be the comic relief in the film ( as nicholson was in batman ) , especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn , the violator's lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny , leaving the audience wishing he would leave . 

leguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role , but he is seen far too often in the film . 

michael jai white , a relative newcomer to theatrical releases , seems to be an appealing actor , and he handles his role adequately , but we see little of him without various masks on . 

more time needed to be spent on white's character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings . 

a special note should be made about martin sheen as the over-the-top , obnoxious , evil general wynn . 

easily the hammiest performance in the movie , it's hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much ; after all , he played a vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now . 

sheen's excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as a mastermind villain and comes as a surprise considering his extensive career in film . 

many other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects to drag spawn down . 

mtv-style , jerky , in-your-face editing is one of them . 

flames , for example , roll across the screen sometimes to announce a shift in setting . 

cogliostro , unlikely wannabe guide for spawn , serves as a poor narrator for the film . 

he goofily tells the audience , at one point , that "" how much of [spawn's] humanity is left remains to be seen , "" as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another . 

the music , finally , assaults the audience as much as the manic violence and offensive dialogue . 

loud and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes . 

to be fair , however , marilyn manson's "" long hard road out of hell "" effectively compliments spawn's return to earth , while filter and the crystal method's "" ( can't you ) trip like i do "" proves a surprisingly fitting theme song . 

for as good a comic book as it is , "" spawn "" did not spawn a good movie . 

spawn , instead , suffers from too much pomp and circumstance , and too little plot and character development . 

it receives two stars for its technically well-done special effects . 

many other films , though , have equal , if not superior , special effects and are much better . 

rated pg-13 , spawn seems more violent than many r-rated movies and probably wouldn't be appropriate for the very young . 
"
"jamaica is a hot vacation spot . 

the exchange rate encourages delusions of wealth ( approximately 30 jamaican dollars to one american ) , the sea is a brilliant blue , the air is warm but lacks humidity . 

and as tourism is unfortunately jamaica's biggest trade , foreigners enter and leave with a sense of relaxation . 

life and debt takes a brassy look at life inside this impoverished country . 

while normal documentaries take the sally struthers approach of underlying scenes of starving children with tearful music , this film guides the viewer with a sarcastic voiceover that brings the troubles home without begging tears to the surface . 

the voiceover is written by acclaimed author jamaica kincaid . 

it guides the audience along a tourist's journey and the story of the native inhabitants . 

instead of telling you what you are already seeing on screen , it quips , "" you don't see what happens after you flush the toilet . "" 

this engages a viewer to see and think about devastation instead of merely being told it is there . 

this strong , sparse storytelling approach runs throughout the film . 

stephanie black is also intelligent in how she chooses to disclose the problems faced by the locals . 

this isn't just another talking head show of people moaning about their horrible lot in life . 

people are interviewed from all sectors of occupation , from field to factory , as well as social theorists and the banking organizations that continue to invest in the country . 

the variety of discussion perpetuates a compelling internal dialogue with any viewer , whether they are seeing jamaica for the first time or not . 

of course , as can be expected , the united states is slammed , owing to its involvement with the international monetary fund and the world bank . 

officials look moronic as they explain why their plans for jamaica's economy will help the country back on its feet , but only if they are willing to follow the advice word for word . 

the next moment we see why and how each of these initiatives has failed , usually due to imports being cheaper than local labor or whether or not the soil is appropriate for the next agricultural trend the u . s . is forcing on the citizens . 

admittedly , some of the back and forth between the business-minded organizations and the failures they produce gets repetitive , but it also drives home the impact ignorance can have on both sides of an international argument . 

but jamaica isn't against the united states , and this documentary does not accuse the u . s . of being the sole perpetrator of its grief . 

if anything , it begs for a better understanding of the nature of jamaican society before stepping in to change it based on foreign regulations .

"mars attacks ! 

 ( 1996 ) - c : jack nicholson , glenn close , annette bening , martin short , danny devito , rod steiger , pierce brosnan , sarah jessica parker , michael j . fox , jim brown , pam grier , joe don baker , natalie portman , christina applegate , lisa marie , tom jones . 

this is director tim burton's finest film to date . 

many will compare this tale of martians who invade earth to independence day , but even though the stories are similar , they really are two distinctly different films . 

however as a whole , mars attacks is much more entertaining than id4 , and i loved id4 . 

you really have to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy this film . 

it is completely wacked-out and unlike anything you've ever seen . 

once the silly tone of the film is set , it's easy to just sit back and throw logic out the window because logic and comedy just don't mix . 

the plot is simple : martians invade the earth . 

but it's different than any other invasion film . 

usually it's the evil aliens versus the heroic humans . 

this time however , it's the goofy aliens versus the equally goofy humans . 

the martians , who are all computer generated , are just about the funniest things i've seen in a long time . 

they look funny , they move funny , and their "" language "" is hilarious . 

and about the special effects . 

the effects in mars attacks ! 

are just about the most flawless ones i've seen to date . 

the computer animation of the martians combined with the goofy personalities they are given makes them seem 100% real . 

there are just a couple of scenes that don't work , mainly those involving sarah jessica parker and pierce brosnan on board an alien ship . 

also , glenn close overacts tremendously in her ( thankfully ) very limited screen time , so much so that i actually applauded silently when her character meets her demise . 

but there are many big laughs in the film , as i said , if you are in the right mood . 

could it have been funnier ? 

certainly . 

was it funny enough ? 

yes . 

was i entertained ? 

absolutely . 

on a personal note , i'd like to thank whomever cast rod steiger ( my favorite actor ) in the film as war-crazy general decker . 

finally , after many very small parts in direct to video garbage and minor tv roles , steiger is back on the big screen in a real movie that many people will see . 

while he's not given the type of role that you can give a real "" performance "" in , he does the job well and has some good lines of dialogue . 

the preview audience i saw the film with really seemed to enjoy him . 
"
"when i first heard that romeo & juliet had been "" updated "" i shuddered . 

i thought that yet another of shakespeare's classics had been destroyed . 

fortunately , i was wrong . 

baz luhrman has directed an "" in your face "" , and visually stunning piece with this film . 

it revolves around the two rival families , who in this version each run multi-million dollar enterprises . 

these rival companies/families are the capulet's and the montague's . 

the younger generation of these two families have formed gangs , who despise one another . 

as the storylines goes , romeo montague ( played by leonardo dicaprio ) and juliet capulet ( claire danes ) meet at a fancy dress party , and it is love at first site . 

i never believed love at first site was possible until i saw this film , the scene in which romeo's eyes meet juliet's through the fish tank is one of the most memorable . 

of course , they cannot publicly reveal their love , for their families are arch enemies . 

so they marry in secret , this is where things begin to go wrong . 

the story , as with all good shakespeare , ends in tragedy . 

the cinematography is spectacular to say the least , and the soundtrack provides the perfect atmosphere in which to "" lay our scene "" , as the film says . 

there is very little to criticise . 

the performances are convincing , and several of the film's younger stars may find that it provides a launch for their careers . 

the modernisation of the script is ingenious and clever . 

despite the well known storyline , this latest version still manages to cause tears among many members of the audience ( especially the younger generation ) , and this is certainly a great credit to the film .

"we're back in blade runner territory with this one , conceptual artist robert longo's vision of a william gibson-inspired future where information is the commodity to kill for . 

front and center is johnny ( keanu reeves ) , a "" cyber-courier "" who smuggles data via a "" wet-wired "" implant . 

he's ready to quit the biz and get a portion of his long-term memory restored , but , first , he has to finish one last , dangerous job . . 

the pressing problem in johnny mnemonic is that keanu reeves seems to have forgotten how to play an action hero since his stint on speed . 

he's walking wood in a forest of stiffs that includes henry rollins , ice-t , and dina meyer . 

 ( dolph lundgren's street preacher is in an acting category all its own . 

 : - ) without a believable performance between them , all we can do is sit back and watch the atmosphere , which is pretty good in places . 

the vr sequences are way cool , but the physical fx--such as miniatures and mattes--leave a lot to be desired . 

watch out for those bad blue-screens ! 

we wouldn't mind a minute of johnny mnemonic if the action played better . 

too bad the debut director isn't very strong in this de- partment . 

his big finale is a sloppy , silly mess that runs twenty minutes too long , which is way past the time that most of our "" wet- wired "" processors have already shut down . 

bottom line : yatf ( yet another tortured future ) . 

skip it .

"as the small boats rock slowly toward the shore at omaha beach normandy on d-day , the weary , seasick soldiers take a deep breath and open the large protective shield at the back of the boat . 

they are unaware of exactly what is going to happen . 

one man kisses the crucifix that hangs around his neck . 

as the flap falls , the battle begins . 

they are trapped like rats in a cage and proceed to be blown to pieces in the wake of enemy gunfire . 

amid the chaos of this massacre , stands a shot that , at least for me , hangs in the air like the girl in the little red coat in schindler's list . 

a soldier , clearly missing an arm , wanders around the body-strewn beach like a lost puppy . 

we are not invited to know what he is searching for until he finds it himself . 

he bends over , picks up his arm and starts to carry it , probably not bothering to ask himself ; "" what now ? "" 

saving private ryan is a masterfully composed film . 

the direction is out of this world , surely the type of command that can win spielberg another directing oscar . 

the cinematography , by janusz kaminsky , is also astounding . 

but be forewarned , this is the most violent and graphic film i have ever seen . 

the articles you read and the warnings you see are justified ; saving private ryan is visually as disturbing as a film can get . 

the question is , "" does the story and its realism justify the excessive use ? "" 

the answer from my point of view is "" no "" . 

braveheart was a truly gritty , and , one would imagine , realistic battle film . 

ryan is ten times worse . 

expect disembowelments , sucked in skulls , heads blown to bits , arms and legs flying across the battlefield . 

many in the theater could not bear to watch . 

and it is a shame , too , because this is otherwise by far one of the standouts this year . 

but such graphic displays may turn away even the most loyal spielberg supporters ( and academy members ) . 

saving private ryan takes us from the attack at omaha beach on d-day , 1944 , through into the film's primary mission . 

captain miller ( hanks ) assembles an 8 man crew and sets off to find a missing solider , private ryan , whose three brothers have already been killed on the battlefield . 

the government goes to great lengths to make sure that mrs . ryan doesn't recieve a fourth letter of condolences about her sons , that no person should suffer such injustice . 

miller's crew is not in favor of the mission and they begin to harbor a secret hatred for ryan , though they don't yet know him . 

they resent having to trudge out to bring home one soldier who doesn't have any more or less right to live than any of them . 

this film manages to keep up a rapid pace and , though there is a lot of set up between battles , the story continues full speed to the end . 

the pacing and dramatism of the extremely well choreographed battle scenes is really in a league of it's own . 

spielberg , though not a student of the "" quick cut "" school of filmmaking , takes a stab at it here , and does it better than michael bay or any of his mtv counterparts could ever hope to do it . 

bay should pay close attention , take copious notes . 

if you want to jump cut every two seconds , do it the way spielberg does it in ryan . 

in the end , the extremity of the gory violence is not justified by the "" importance "" of the film . 

schindler's list taught many people the truth about the holocaust . 

it opened eyes , sparked debate and study . 

though the battle scenes in ryan have never been portrayed as realistically before , they don't amount to anything as serious or thought provoking as the schindler's list . 

overall , this is just the truest depiction of the old adage , "" war is hell . "" 

but braveheart-dosage would have fit this movie much more appropriately , and would have made the difference between me getting up the nerve to see it again some day and realizing that this is something i doubt i could endure again . 

masterful work marred only by excessive gore . 
"
"after sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project , making the third installment in the godfather-trilogy . 

this new film has been underrated for no reason . 

it is as intellectual and majestically made as copolla's pervious films . 

it is also more psychological , pessimistic and more tragic than the first two . 

the only regret is the unconvincing performance by the newcomer sofia copolla and some "" unfinished "" developments of some characters . 

the film elegantly begins with nino rota's recognizable musical score , the beautiful skyscrapers of new york and michael's voice as he is writing a letter to his children : "" the only wealth in this world is children . 

more than all money and power on earth , you are my treasure "" . 

the year is 1979 and michael corleone has used the time since the ending of "" part ii "" to make his father's dream come true - making the corleone family legitimate . 

michael sold all his casinos and invests only in gambling . 

constantly haunted by the past , his only reason to live is his children . 

the family has amassed unimaginable wealth , and as the film opens michael corleone ( al pacino ) is being invested with a great honor by the church . 

later that day , at a reception , his daughter announces a corleone family gift to the church and the charities of sicily , "" a check in the amount of $100 million . "" 

but the corleones are about to find , as others have throughout history , that you cannot buy forgiveness . 

sure , you can do business with evil men inside the church , for all men are fallible and capable of sin . 

but god does not take payoffs . 

the plot of the movie , concocted by coppola and mario puzo in a screenplay inspired by headlines , brings the corleone family into the inner circles of corruption in the vatican . 

there is a moment in "" godfather iii "" where michael says : "" all my life i have been trying to go up in society , where everything was legal . 

but the higher i go , the crookier it becomes . . "" 

 . 

visually this film is as spectacular as the first two . 

gordon willis' rich cinematography , carmine copolla's beautiful composition and alex tavoularis' wonderful art direction could not be better . 

but copolla's first two godfather-films were more famous for their deep , intellectual plots , tree dimensional characters and incredible acting , than for their visual perfection . 

the third installment has only the plot and visuals . 

some characters could be much more developed and the acting , although good , never accomplishes to reach the same height of the first two films . 

the biggest miscasting is sofia copolla , who is so unconvincing and unemotional that she manages to ruin several scenes throughout the movie , that could have been grander and more emotional . 

the best performance comes unsurprisingly from al pacino , who should have got a nomination for best actor at the oscars . 

andy garcia is powerful as sonny's son , strong , focused and loyal . 

violence is natural to him . 

he suffers no pangs of conscience when he takes revenge on his family's behalf , and in this he is supposed to be strong in the uncomplicated way don vito corleone was . 

however both kay ( diane keaton ) and connie ( talia shire ) are useless . 

and characters like vito corleone and tom hagen are really missed . 

the good part is that michael is again reunited with old friends , that you remember from the first and second films . 

in the third film michael has become almost like his father , vito in the first film and vincenzo resembles michael when he was much younger . 

this parallel could be more interesting if vincenzo's character was more developed . 

many have pointed out that making the third film , was unnecessary . 

i disagree . 

it is a beautiful film of great importance , completing the tragic saga of the corleone family . 

the first film showed some horrible results of corleone's life . 

it showed michael making a choice ; the second showed a man damning himself for his choices and feeling the impact of changing times . 

a man desperately trying to keep his balance , focus , family and sanity , while everything is crashing all around him . 

the third film is a terrifying conclusion - a result of michael's life . 

the life he chose for himself is like quicksand - one wrong step and you are doomed . 

there is no turning back . 

and no matter how hard you try to get out of it , to free yourself , no matter how powerful and wealthy you are , you are helpless - sinking deeper and deeper till it swallows you completely . 

the beautifully directed last sequence is also the powerful climax of the film , when michael is sitting alone in his chair , left by everyone , surrounded by emptiness and memories of his friends and family members long dead . 

here he dies - alone , miserable and unforgiven 
"
"i cried during _babe_ . 

i admit it . 

the special effects , the story , the great dialogue were woven together so delicately and successfully that my mind lost track that this was a "" children's film "" --so much so that , yes , i got a little overly sentimental . 

such , my friend , is the power of cinema . 

when word came out that they were using this newly developed f/x for a doctor dolittle update , in which eddie murphy plays the title character , and many great comic actors supply the voices , my anticipation rose to great expectations . 

they can't possibly drop the ball on this one . 

can't miss . 

can't possibly miss . 

they missed . 

what went wrong ? 

after much thought , i supply three general rules . 

 ( 1 ) don't let a television actress-turned-comedy movie director near an urbanite script ( i . e . , penny marshall's dreadful "" preacher's wife "" ) . 

betty thomas worked wonders with "" the brady bunch movie "" , but the same sitcom-airiness doesn't quite work here . 

it's as if she lifted a generic sitcom , and iced it with light doses of modern r&b . 

take away the black cast , take away the atrocious soundtrack , and you have the residue of some mid-80's kirk cameron show . 

 ( 2 ) the greater the cast , the less the individual cast-member has to do ( i . e . , 

 "" con air "" ) . 

it is great to have the comic voices of jenna elfman , garry schandling , john leguizimo , ellen degeneres , and gilbert godfried in your lineup , but they have nothing to do but improvise their underdeveloped , stereotyped characters , one-line-at-a-time . 

it's even worse , because sometimes their voices are so unrecognizable that you don't get the satisfaction of linking the voice to the comedian until the credits . 

now there are three character actors who do get special treatment : albert brooks brings dignity to nearly every project he's in , and the scenes as a depressed tiger do resonate a certain poignancy . 

norm mcdonald fares nearly as well , as a stray dog who learns to bond with dolittle . 

but there's little humor here . 

that rests on the shoulders of chris rock , sorely miscast and unfunny as the voice of their wise-ass guinea pig . 

even the mouth is ill-synched . 

 ( 3 ) don't let the special effects technicians walk away with the script . 

there's a certain timing that's mandatory in comedy . 

to have this timing usurped by the brilliancy of computer generated mouths or lifelike creations of jim henson's creature shop , is a travesty . 

this is not to say that special effects filled comedies or muppet movies aren't well-timed laughfests ; with the right director , they can be and have . 

here , betty thomas is clearly over her head . 

i wish i could commend the special effects , but they're merely average . 

count the number of times where the animal's mouth is turned away from the camera , or too far to notice , or ill-synched . 

this is less a "" babe "" and more of a "" look who's barking "" clone . 

you may be wondering , 'how does eddie murphy fare ? ' 

well , he came back with the exceptional "" nutty professor "" , and i don't doubt he can come back again . 

here , he's tied into a straight man and given little to do . 

the exceptions are when he fears he's going crazy : a far cry from his smarter-than-you'd expect routine that he's more adept at . 

it's unfortunate that he is where richard pryor was ten years ago , making lame comedies without the same bite he had given in his early years . 

after all this , what's left ? 

butt jokes . 

a _lot_ of butt jokes . 

i guess for kids that may be funny , but i was stone-faced . 

if there's a lesson the film may be telling us , is that animals have feelings too , and they care way too much for your butt . 
"
"one way of telling if a film is good or not is by the length . 

if a film is only 90 minutes , but feels like 300 minutes , then it's crap . 

but if a film last 2 1/2 hours , and feels like 90 minutes , then it's excellent . 

boogie nights falls into the latter catagory . 

the director , anderson , delivers a funny , hip , yet sometimes violent film , which flies along . 

mark whalberg , a . k . a 

marky mark , plays eddie adams , a seventeen year old with a certain 'gift' in the midriff area . 

jack horner ( reynolds ) is a adult film director , who decides that eddie would be great in the adult movie business . 

after running away from home , eddie joins jack , changes his name to dirk diggler , and starts making erotic movies . 

in the movie business , dirk meets a whole load of characters ( which the film introduces very quickly and slickly ) such as scotty ( phillip seymour hoffman ) , rollergirl ( graham ) amber ( moore ) and floyd ( phillip baker hall ) , and little bill ( william h . macy ) all the characters are well written , well played , and the audience gets to know them pretty well , thanks to the excellent script . 

we learn about ambers grief about not being able to see her child due to a divorce , rollergirls hard time at school , and little bills wife , who sleeps with everyone except her husband . 

but the best thing about the excellent boogie nights is paul andersons direction and writing . 

the direction is fast , thrilling , and never holds up . 

there are some great shots , some lovely steadiocam and handheld camera sequences , and lots of other neat directional touches . 

the writing is fabulous , with some intelligent dialogue , some funny dialogue , but none of the dialogue is crap , like most hollywood films ( such as the lost world : jurassic park ( 1997 ) , or tommorow never dies ( 1997 ) . ) 

boogie nights really is a spectacular feat of direction and writing , on par ( and sometimes betters ) quentin tarantino's films resevoir dogs ( 1992 ) and pulp fiction ( 1994 ) 

the soundtrack is also excellent . 

like american graffiti ( 1973 ) , the film features some great old songs on the soundtrack , which heightens the atmosphere , and gives the film an extra lift . 

also , the costumes are great . 

the clothes really do look like what people wore in the seventies and eighties . 

the film , although excellent , does have some flaws . 

firstly , wahlberg , although excellent , cannot do highly scenes which require him to be angry . 

in both scenes where he has to act angry , his acting is so 'off' , the scenes tension and anger is lost . 

but the rest of the cast are excellent . 

burt reynolds is brilliant , julianne moore shows real emotion , and william h . macy is great aswell ( but he always is . ) 

another flaw with the film , though , is that the ending seems a bit tacked on . 

it seems anderson saw the film was going on a bit , and needed to wrap up quickly . 

it's a shame , really , as the rest of the film is perfectly paced . 

but they're small niggles really . 

boogie nights is an excellent film . 

superb directing , writing , acting and music , all combine to make one spectacular film . 

whatever you do , do not miss out on boogie nights .

"in one of my many videos i have attained from the local library , casablanca was my third classic in some weeks . 

the others being citizen kane and vertigo ( yes , i am trying to see as many of afi's greatest movies ever made as i can ) . 

but , casablanca stood out from the rest for me : it was actually watchable . 

what most hail as the greatest american film ever , casablanca isn't so much a love story as a political frenzy with a love triangle thrown in . 

it seems that star humphry bogart spend about 85 percent of the movie with various leaders of the nation instead of with ingred bergman . 

that annoyed me , as did the ending . 

why didn't the plan turn around ? ! ? 

surprisingly , i enjoyed the film . 

i liked bogart's character and his acting ( not over the top as most actors in his era ) . 

i once read about if you had a choice to be in a movie , which one would it be , and a women said casablanca . 

at first i was thinking to myself "" why ? "" 

then , as i watched the film again , i understood why . 

the movie is very well done and the script top-notch , although i doubt i understood more than half of the political mumbo jumbo . 

casablanca is , in my mind , no classic ( like solaris ) , but it is a good film and stylishly shot . 

hey , hollywood , how about this : a remake with harrison ford and anne heche ? 

now that would be a classic .

"razor blade smile running as part of the vancouver international film festival played october 2nd and 4th , 1998 . 

official release : halloween 

reviewed by vince yim 

`you think you know all about vampires . . . believe 

me . . . you 

know f * ck all . ' 

with these words , we are brought into the world of a sultry vampire seductress by the name of lilith silver ( played by eileen daly ) . 

made into an immortal a century and a half ago by the sinister ethan blake , she continues to alleviate boredom with her state of being . 

so , what's an undead girl to do , except squeeze into the tightest fitting clothes possible , get out her guns , seduce a few guys , and kill a few people for money and blood ? 

with that out of the way , let me say this . 

this film is bad . 

this film is really , really bad . 

yet somehow , it is strangely enjoyable . 

with all the elements of a direct to video horror flick ? buxom babes , gore , cheesy dialogue , and bad acting ? any casual film viewer would be more inclined to spend their money on renting innocent blood or going to see blade . 

still , it is considered to be one of the finest british vampire film . 

agreed , it might be , but is far from being the best vampire flick ever . 

period . 

razor blade smile has some rather high production values , shown by the nice overall tone to the film . 

the film is also a bit of a departure from popular vampire lore , with a vampire that can go out in broad daylight without disintegrating , doesn't sleep in a coffin ( but leaves one next to her computer ) , and sees religion as the `opium of the peoples' ( hence , immunity to crosses ) . 

but aside from that , it doesn't stray too far away from horror film conventions . 

that is , unless that is intentional . 

razor blade smile literally goes for the throat , then pumps the wound full of processed cheese . 

you can't help but laugh when a female vampire gets decapitated and her severed head goes flying into a puddle . 

you'll laugh even harder at the hideously contrived situations ( to distract two female guards , lilith tosses a cellular phone towards them and dials the number ) . 

you'll laugh the hardest when a murder witness recants the tale and suddenly starts sobbing uncontrollably . 

and then , there's the sudden twist ending ( i have enough heart not to give it away ) . 

the film refuses to take itself seriously , which is a good thing , as by the time lilith zips up her skin-tight body suit and then unzips it just to show the right amount of cleavage , you've most likely forgotten the main point of the story . 

but in case you really care , she's been assigned to kill a bunch of people who belong to the so-called illuminati , and she's leaving a huge mess behind for the police to find . 

as much as my criticisms , this movie works best as a guilty pleasure or as a film that you watch with your friends and within groups . 

almost destined for cult-status , the film's campy , cheesy overtones actually work towards the film . 

while this may not necessarily be the film you'd want to be seen watching by yourself , it makes for a fun time at the movies . 
"
"after seeing blaze and driving miss daisy , i was ready for some mindless fun--oh , maybe something like tango & cash . 

maybe not ! 

mindless fun is one thing , but brain-dead slop is another matter altogether . 

tango & cash has "" lowest common denominator "" written all over it . 

the movie stars sylvester stallone and kurt russell as rival undercover cops in l . a . russell plays cash , a reckless slob who dresses in jeans and tee shirts . 

stallone plays tango , a wealthy investor who works on the force strictly for the thrill of it ; he doesn't need the money . 

in an effort to change his image , stallone goes for a yuppie , gq look in the film , wearing spectacles and three piece suits . 

the two detectives reluctantly become partners after they are framed for murder and have to break out of prison to clear their names . 

tango & cash is unbearably noisy . 

for starters , there's harold faltermeyer's annoying synthesized score , which gets old after four notes . 

to make matters worse , the filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions and screeching cars , the more the merrier . 

in fact , the movie begins with not one but two car chases . 

there's nothing like a good old car chase to introduce the characters in a movie . 

screenwriter randy feldman's brain must have gone to mush from watching too many cop shows on tv . 

his shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything and everything the movie has going for it , such as stallone's efforts to convince you that tango is an intellectual . 

in a movie with the iq level of an amoeba , even a great actor is going to have trouble looking intelligent--and stallone is no lawrence olivier . 

it's hard to imagine anyone reading feldman's script and thinking , "" i want to be in this movie . "" 

the film's plot doesn't have one original bone in its body , and--again--you have to point your finger at the screenwriting . 

feldman's story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book , making tango & cash altogether generic and predictable . 

they simply could have called it "" action movie . "" 

every character , every twist and turn , is stolen from television or from other movies . 

adding insult to injury , tango & cash is about as believable as a "" road runner "" cartoon . 

action movies don't have to be realistic , but they should absorb you enough so that you're not thinking about the lack of realism . 

the only artistic aspect of tango & cash is the cinematography . 

there are some spectacular shots , especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango and cash slide to safety on electrical wires . 

the film's main draw is the chemistry between stallone and russell . 

unfortunately , their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants . 

the dialogue consists of nothing but one-liners , and consequently the attempts at character development are embarrassing . 

it's a shame because with a workable screenplay , russell and stallone could have turned tango & cash into a charming "" lethal weaponesque "" adventure . 

tango & cash tries to maintain a light tone , and you do laugh about once every five minutes . 

seeing russell in drag is the movie's funniest moment , but you probably already have seen it in the commercials . 

furthermore , the light tone does not sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence . 

machine guns and torture generally don't mix well with comedy . 

jack palance appears in tango & cash doing what he does best : playing a sleazy , conniving villain . 

his character , however , is run-of-the-mill , except for his strange obsession with mice . 

like many movie villains , palance likes to play games . 

in fact , he sets a ridiculously elaborate trap for tango and cash , a trap which sends the two detectives to prison so they can be beaten and electrocuted by some meanies in the boiler room . 

you have to wonder why palance doesn't just shoot the detectives in the head ! 

the story would crumble if any of the characters were to do anything intelligent . 

teri hatcher plays stallone's sister and russell's love-interest , and she is just as pretty as can be . 

but regrettably , hatcher's acting is not on par with her exceptional beauty . 

every time she opens her mouth , you cringe ; corny dialogue and atrocious acting are always a fatal combination . 

there's really very little , if anything , to recommend in the film . 

and , more to the point , tango definitely isn't worth a penny of your cash--so don't bother . 
"
"this review contains spoilers , but believe me , i don't say anything you can't guess 10 minutes into the movie . 

i * did * go into this one with high expectations . 

i had been exposed to media reports that this film would signify a departure from the slasher flicks . 

i sort of expected another exorcist or the shining . 

i even put aside my general rule of not seeing this type of film . 

boy , was i wrong ! 

another garbage slasher flick , the only difference being that * this * one has a story ! 

the story , you ask ? 

well , a scumball buys a chinese puzzle from a guy in an arab souk . 

he takes it home , somehow getting it past customs : - ) and starts fiddling with it in his attic . 

lo and behold , after he takes it apart , three demons appear and start taking him apart , but with meat hooks . 

when they're finished , his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling . 

they botch up their cleanup job , however , and manage to leave his heart ( or some gland ; i didn't really recognize the organ ) under a floorboard . 

the guy's brother and his brother's wife appear at the door soon after , and decide to move in . 

they throw away scumball's belongings , and set up house . 

turns out that wife is a bit of a nympho , and screwed around with scumball right before her marriage . 

she starts having some wild hallucinations . 

later , hubby spills some blood on the attic floorboards ( slow-mo special effects of the buckets of blood hitting the ground--all from the tiny cut on his hand ) . 

said blood is eagerly sucked up by scumball's organ . 

the organ grows into a thing that requires yet more blood in order to complete the regeneration into a really ugly thing . 

it establishes mind contact with wife , who agrees to help him get more blood , because she really wants to be screwed again . 

so , she helps him kill three businessmen . 

scumball , at this time , gradually gets his strength back and grows all his organs back . 

problem is , he doesn't have any skin , and even after three or four corpses , still doesn't get any skin . 

he finally gets some , though , but strangely enough , he ends up looking like his brother . 

guess they couldn't get the original actor back . 

who knows . 

scumball ( whose name is frank ) is not a nice guy . 

he describes his torture by the demons fondly , as the "" ultimate pleasure and pain , since at that level there is no difference between the two . "" 

somehow , i don't see getting torn apart by 90 fish- and meat-hooks a lot of fun . 

this guy is * so * bad ( "" how bad * is * he ? "" ) , 

 * so * bad that the * rats * cower in a corner in fear . 

for good reason , too ; he crucifies two of them for fun , and carves a third while the nympho's horsing around with hubby . 

anyway . hubby's daughter ( who , if course , is not * wife's * daughter ) starts to suspect something is wrong after she sees wife going into the attic with one of her johns and the ensuing screams . 

the dumb bimbo meets scumball , and is not impressed . 

she manages to escape with the chinese puzzle , and brings out the demons . 

at any rate , the demons are pissed off that they screwed up their cleanup ; they're normally quite meticulous about that type of thing . 

the story boils down to the demons trying to correct their mistake . 

the demons are not , however , the good guys . 

the dumb bimbo's the good guy . 

she somehow not only gets them to take care of frank , but also banishes them to hell or oblivion , we're not too sure which . 

not too shabby for someone with single-digit iq . 

this is basically a "" bad jinn "" story . 

it is an * awful * movie . 

awful acting , bad focus in the photography , many scenes of skin being penetrated by meathooks , which is really unrealistic , and looks like the latex that it is . 

continuity ? 

who cares . 

acting ? 

 * terrible * . 

script ? 

horrible . 

sounds canned . 

unrealistic . 

story is so-so , but the impact is lost long , long before the film ends . 

i do think the * rat * acting was quite good . 

i have never seen rats look afraid . 

they should get nominated for an award . 

really good acting there , the best in the movie . 

 "" the envelope for best furry rodent , please . . . "" 

a "" "" rating would be far too generous . 

a "" 1/10 "" rating ( or -4 in the -4 to +4 rating system ) is far more accurate . 

this movie is so bad that people in the audience were laughing , chortling at the bad acting and crummy dialog . 

i can see this film turning into the next rocky horror picture show . 

people were getting so fed up they were yelling warnings up to the characters on the screen . 

had to have something to do . 

dumb , dumb , dumb movie . 

i was embarrassed that i spent money to see it . 

it goes without saying that i disagree with the other reviews on the board that attempt to review the film for itself . 

lots of slime and red-dyed corn syrup does not constitute "" horror , "" in my opinion .

"alexandre dumas meets hong kong action with newcomer justin chambers reprising the oft-played character of dashing swordsman d'artagnon in director peter hyam's adventure "" the musketeer . "" 

for some reason that i may figure out later , i don't know why the time , money and effort were put into the making of "" the musketeer . "" 

it may be that someone had the clever idea of combining the dumas characters and story with the current enamor with the action work of hong kong imports like this film's xin-xin xiong ( "" once upon a time in china "" ) and yuen woo-ping from "" crouching tiger , hidden dragon . "" 

the result is a mix of genres that don't mesh well . 

elements of the ritz brothers-style comedy ( for those few who remember that comedic troupe from the 1939 "" the three musketeers "" ) , the man with no name from "" a fistful of dollars "" ( d'artagnan demands that the bad guys apologize to his horse in a direct ref to the clint eastwood spaghetti western ) and hong kong action choreography are all utilized in the original script by gene quintano . 

the result is an action flick that bears little resemblance to its source material while it makes contemporary that material in an effort to grab the "" matrix "" crowd . 

alexandre dumas may well be rolling in his grave if he knows what was done to his classic oeuvre and characters . 

the real problem with the "" the musketeer "" lies in the casting of the two lead , romantically intertwined characters , d'artagnan and francesca ( mena suvari ) . 

chambers has the boyishly handsome good looks for the character , a la chris o'donnell , but lacks any onscreen charisma . 

suvari has the doe-eyed , pretty looks as the chambermaid who has the ear of the queen , but she , too , does not have the chemistry to command the screen . 

if "" the musketeer "" makes them any money , they should invest in acting lessons . 

stronger performers may have helped to raise the bar on this one . 

the supporting cast is , on the surface , impressive . 

catherine denueve plays the queen of france and lends her character an air of royalty , dignity and humor , especially when she plays off of d'artagnan's mentor , planchet ( jean-pierre castaldi , who reminds of andre the giant in "" the princess bride ) . 

stephen rea looks good in the part of the conniving usurper cardinal richelieu , but is given very little to help flesh out his character . 

tim roth is the kind of bad guy you love to hate as the cardinal's chief henchman , febre . 

he is so bad he makes simon legree look like a boy scout . 

the rest of the players , particularly the three musketeers aramis ( nick moran , "" lock , stock and two smoking barrels "" ) , porthos ( steve spiers ) and athos ( jan gregor kremp ) , are background fodder whose role is to come to d'artagnan's aid when needed . 

peter hyam's does double duty as director and cinematography and may be too stretched to do both well . 

a stronger hand at the helm could have helped the mediocre performances of the leads and better utilized his veteran thesps . 

photography is straightforward action fare that goes through all the appropriate action flick motions - d'artagnan takes on a tavern full of thugs and bests them single-handed ; he fights a gang of febre's henchmen aboard a speeding coach to protect the queen ( with the obligatory branches hanging over the road ) ; he goes one on one with his lifelong enemy , febre , who murdered d'artagnan's folks years before . 

it is all routine stuff . 

the renowned wire work developed by the hong kong action masters is used to artificial effect as the players leap , defying gravity , up walls and from horse to horse . 

it works in a sci-fi film like "" the matrix "" or in a classical fantasy like "" crouching tiger , hidden dragon "" but just calls attention to itself in "" the musketeer . "" 

at one point i could swear i saw the stunt wire being used . 

it did not make me a believer and i am very disappointed . 

with a run time of 106 minutes it should have been more like 80 and i give it a d .

"has hollywood run out of interesting characters and plot-driven suspense thrillers that we must spend two hours watching will smith and a gritty gene hackman exchange obtuse dialogue and run around dodging fireballs ? 

in enemy of the state , that is exactly right . 

a few parts the net , and a few parts conspiracy theory , enemy is about as exciting as watching smith talk to cgi aliens in 1997's lame brained men in black . 

will this guy ever get a real role ? 

he has the bruce willis syndrome . 

the plot is bascially smith , playing a lawyer , getting into hot water with some high government murderers , who assassinated a powerful political figure earlier in the movie , when a tape of the killing gets into his hands . 

he inlists the help of an old conspirator ( hackman ) , and , at the end , er . . . you 

know . 

enemy was one of the worst films of last year . 

not only was it sloppy in telling its story and getting its facts straight , the acting was mediocre when it should have been energy driven , and i didn't like how smith always magically out-smarted the badies when all the other extra characters , seeming more intelligent than smith , somehow got run over by a truck . 

enemy came out around the same time as the superior star trek : insurrection . 

i know these two films are different in , well , everything , but the fact that enemy outgrossed insurrection just baffels me . 

somehow , quality can't overshadow quantity .

"the premise of wag the dog is so simple that it's adequately explained by the commercials . 

with 11 days to go until the election , the president ( who we never see ) calls in political dirty-tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal . 

deniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a "" pageant "" , a phony war against albania , fought on the blue screens of hollywood and the recording studios of nashville , with woody harrelson as the reluctant , psychotic hero . 

and if there wasn't anything more to the movie than this , it would be a second-rate heist comedy at best , enlivened by great actors -- like sneakers goes to washington . 

 ( a heist comedy ? 

yup . 

deniro and hoffman are "" stealing "" the election , so to speak , and the movie is more about how they do it -- and the fun they have doing it -- than anything else . ) 

wag the dog succeeds because it's based one great truth : the american people are stupid . 

ok , maybe it's not "" love thy neighbor as thyself "" or even "" two plus two makes four "" , but a truth nonetheless . 

 ( any average person who thinks that they're really smart about the two things this movie satirizes -- moviemaking and the political process -- is invited , nay , challenged , to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or 48 hours straight watching c-span when the house is in session . ) 

and because we're so utterly , predictably stupid , hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo , washington knows that we won't notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies -- and deniro's character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won't be able to locate albania on the map . 

the beauty of wag the dog is that it isn't a light , meaningless comedy about politics ( like speechless , the michael keaton - geena davis picture ) or from the level of light-hearted politcal satire to near-greatness . 

nor is it a hard-edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally-deprived , ethically challenged baby-boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house ( like primary colors -- and yes , i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out , thanks for asking ) . 

instead , david mamet's script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire . 

it does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers' schemes come off beautifully , and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion . 

deniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables , without any of the violent rages . 

it's all : "" what do i love ? 

what is it that brings me joy ? 

baseball , "" minus the savage bloody beating with the bat . 

he threatens a lot of people , mind you , but he's doing it in a very nice , polite way . 

it's a very mellow , restrained performance , which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script . 

hoffman , on the other hand , is giddy , exuberant and joyous . 

this kind of thing is what his character lives for , and he's so excited that he can't even shut up . 

even on the edge of disaster , he's bright-eyed ( behind oddly tinted sunglasses ) and positive . 

insiders note that he's basing his character on some powerful-but-anonymous producer -- which may or may not be true , but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets-put-on-a-show electricity that you figure a producer needs to have . 

the best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast . 

the characters are so well drawn and so well acted that we want to see more of them , listen to them talk in that wised-up mamet dialogue , get to know them better -- which we don't . 

anne heche , is dead-bang-on in her portrayal of a political press aide -- cool and composed on the outside , panicked and frenzied on the outside . 

denis leary ( one of my favorite actors -- see the ref ) is the "" fad king "" , who handles the profitable "" back-end "" -- t-shirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative , innovative ways to separate a fool from his money . 

they could make a whole movie , just about the fad king , and i'd go see it . 

willie nelson and merle haggard handle the musical end of things fabulously , from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song , to the weepy country waltz , to the hilarious "" ballad of the green berets "" parody . 

woody harrelson has a brief , but memorable part as the overmedicated "" hero "" of the albanian conflict . 

craig t . nelson , as the opposition candidate , and the ever-reliable william h . macy , as a wacky cia agent , are given surprisingly short shrift . 

 ( one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing . ) 

wag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems : the trivialization of american politics , the role of the press in dumbing down the issues , the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials , the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars -- the list goes on . 

we can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens . 

wag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we don't .

"the high school comedy seems to be a hot genre of the moment . 

with she's all that and varsity blues behind us , and several more set for release later in the year , the teen comedy seems to be experiencing its own renaissance . 

however , you wouldn't know it from the quality of the latest entry : jawbreaker . 

this shockingly bitter candy definitely has a sour center . 

the most popular , and most feared , clique at reagan high school have an unexpected dilemma . 

they have accidentally killed one of their own , the "" teen dream "" , liz purr ( charlotte roldan ) , choked on a giant jawbreaker during a kidnapping prank for her 17th birthday . 

now the three surviving girls must decide what to do . 

it takes little time at all for the group's leader , courtney ( rose mcgowan ) , to decide to cover it up . 

the ditzy marcie ( julie benz ) is game to go along , but the clique's final member , julie ( rebecca gayheart ) , has a guilty conscience . 

to make things worse , another student , the hopelessly geeky fern mayo ( judy evans greer ) accidentally discovers the truth . 

the girls' cover is surely blown . . . 

not so fast . 

thinking quickly , courtney offers fern a once-in-a-lifetime chance . 

after a quick makeover , fern is transformed into vylette , the beautiful "" new girl "" at school , and a full-fledged member of the popular crowd . 

does this mean that popularity is the key to getting away with murder ? 

or will this finely honed plan crack over time ? 

jawbreaker is obviously attempting to be the heathers of its generation , and failing miserably , i might add . 

it manages to capture the mix of murder and teen social observations , but misses three crucial elements : sharp dialogue , witty characters and the much-needed humor . 

it is possible that jawbreaker might have succeeded in being ( darkly ) humorous if it wasn't shackled to its dead-weight plot . 

the film's most innovative twist is the makeover of fern mayo . 

at this point , jawbreaker seems poised to spin wildly into the uncharted depths . 

but then , all of a sudden , the innovation stops . 

the film becomes mired in the murder-and-cover-up plotting , which quickly saps what little life and energy there was right out of the film . 

in the film , rose mcgowan fares the best . 

as the manipulative clique leader , she truly dominates every scene she's in ( not a difficult feat in a crowd such as this , however ) . 

it's a character crying out for a better movie ( or at least another decently drawn character with which to interact . ) 

jawbreaker doesn't quite know how to handle its semi-likable characters : fern and julie . 

either one could effectively end the movie at any time by simply revealing what she knows . 

the lengths to which the film goes to prolong the plot have the unintentional effect of distancing us from these characters . 

as their motives become murky and unclear , the film finally falls to the point that it doesn't really matter who wins or loses , since all sides have become equally detestable . 

 "" detestable "" is a good word to describe the film , jawbreaker . 

it's certain that , like the murder weapon described in the film's title , jawbreaker will be triggering more than one gag reflex in the audience .

"susan granger's review of "" glitter "" ( 20th century-fox ) 

there's less here than meets the eye . 

or , put it this way , if you thought madonna was awful in "" shanghai surprise , "" mariah carey's worse in this reworking of "" a star is born . "" 

she plays billie frank who , despite being abandoned by her singer/alcoholic mother ( valerie pettiford ) , believes she's destined for greatness because everyone tells her she is . 

 "" you've got this amazing gift , and you gotta use it , "" her roommate says . 

 "" your voice - it's incredible , "" says another singer . 

 "" i ain't never met anyone like you , "" proclaims julian "" dice "" black ( max beesley ) , the hot new york dj who becomes her svengali-like producer/lover . 

problem is : her signature song , "" i didn't mean to turn you on "" is wretched . 

and when she fumes out of filming her first music video because the director wants to "" exploit "" her by having her wear a bikini , the audience bursts into laughter . 

exploit mariah carey , who chooses to wear as little as the law will allow ? 

come on ! 

writer kate lanier's script is fatuous and director vondie curtis-hall doesn't have a clue how to handle the glitzy pop diva and , as a result of their incompetence , whispery-voice'd ms . carey seems to be embarrassed on-screen . 

she almost cringes when the camera comes in for a close-up , pursing her lips and averting her glassy eyes . 

talented british musician max beesley appears equally inept , and as cinematographer geoffrey simpson pans around the manhattan skyline , there's an audible audience groan when the twin towers of the world trade center come into view . 

perhaps one of the reasons ms . carey suffered her highly-publicized nervous breakdown this summer is because she saw a preview of this clunker . 

on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" glitter "" is a pathetic 1 . 

right now , it's tops on my list of the worst of 2001 .

"scream 2 has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well . 

during a film-class discussion , windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are , and why sequels never live up to the originals . 

a few rare exceptions are noted , but they left out one . 

 . 

 . 

scream 2 ! 

1996's surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america ! 

a sequel was unavoidable , but luckily the re-teaming of writer kevin williamson and director wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment . 

in fact , at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream , i would say that scream 2 might even be the better film ! 

sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , the sinuous heroine who survived a series of murders in woodsboro , ca in the original scream , is now two years older and off to college , majoring in theater . 

meanwhile , tv journalist gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who covered the murders in the first film , has since written a book about the dreadful events ; a book titled "" stab "" , which has been developed into a major motion picture . 

as scream 2 opens , a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of "" stab "" , and before long , a young couple are butchered to death , unnoticed in the midst of hysteria . 

this marks the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown "" copycat "" sets out to repeat what's been done . 

 . 

 . 

and finish what hasn't ! 

of course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the first film , and yes , movies play a huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as he/she goes about slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds , but this * is * a sequel , and without deviating from the original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies . 

this is in large part due to williamson's deliciously written script , which will easily leave you satisfied . 

as much as the film condemns the use of cliches , it is riddled with them , but it is done so effectively , and with skillful direction by craven , that you're not bound to complain . 

i will note , however , that the "" whodunit ? "" 

did wind up being the first person i suspected , but believe me , i kept changing my mind as i tried to stay one ahead of the movie . 

all the actors outdo themselves here . 

we're not talking oscar performances , but cambell , cox , david arquette as dewey riley , and jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing . 

the characters remain true to their roots , and yet show a clear sign of development over the last two years . 

we can see how the events in the first film has affected them , but we don't lose any of the luster that made them such a delight to watch in the first place . 

the nice thing about scream 2 is that it doesn't seem off-kilter from it's predecessor . 

it's a natural , smooth , and believable ( as far as horror films go ) transition from film to film . 

we skip two years , but there doesn't seem to be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two flicks . 

it flows so well that you feel more like you're reading chapter two of a book ( long chapters , eh ? ) 

than just revitalizing a cast of familiar faces . 

while main characters are usually the only connection in sequels , scream 2's entire plot structure correlates * completely * with the first , making for immediate fondness and absorption . 

as i said before , scream 2 easily lives up to , if not surpassing , it's precursor . 

the only reason scream will likely be hailed above scream 2 is because it was the first . 

this doesn't mean that it overcasts the unique , whimsical humor or overall caliber of it's sequel , it just means that scream will forever be known as the movie that mocked it's own while maintaining it's sought-after qualities . 

if ever a film followed it's original so well , it would be scream 2 , and it makes this a definite must-see for all those unbridled scream fans out there . 

scream 2 fits snugly alongside scream , and will hopefully receive as many high remarks . 

it would top off the series quite well , if it weren't for the fact that two movies don't really make a series . 

it's unlikely to assume that a scream 3 won't appear in the next few years , but if they do decide to turn this into an undeniably acclaimed horror-trilogy , let's hope they can keep up the fantastic work . 

like they say , don't mess with perfection . 

 .

but when a money-making smash-hit is almost guaranteed , who's gonna listen ?

"in the finale of disney's "" mighty joe young , "" a 15-foot tall , 2000-pound gorilla holds a frightened young boy in its clutches as it topples from a crippled ferris wheel and plummets to the ground . 

upon impact , rugged everyman and perennial do-gooder bill paxton rushes in , containing the emotional crowd with an earnest "" move along now folks , there's nothing to see here . "" 

ok , so those aren't exactly the words he uses , but it's probably one of the few clich ? s not uttered in this unnecessary remake of an unnecessary remake of that mother of all monster movies , "" king kong . "" 

1949's "" mighty joe young "" was an update of that classic creature feature , also based on merian c . cooper's original story ( 16 years after "" 'kong "" it appeared the world was ready for a new take on the beauty and the beast fable ) . 

now some 49 years later , at least according to disney's way of thinking , the world is ready for one more . 

not so . 

the only--and i mean only--reason to see the 1998 version is for the special effects . 

and these , unfortunately , run hot and cold . 

today's joe young is designed and produced by special-effects whiz rick baker , who has been wowing audiences with his state-of-the-art make-up effects since 1971's "" schlock "" ( which , incidentally , featured a baker-enhanced "" gorilla "" ) . 

joe is a combination of animatronic effects , computer graphics , and that old standard , a man in a monkey suit . 

while there are occasional flashes of brilliance--baker's had a lot of practice with simian effects , after all , including "" gorillas in the mist , "" "" greystoke : the legend of tarzan , lord of the apes , "" and the 1976 remake of "" king kong "" --there's also some surprising cheesiness . 

one of the film's most embarrassing moments is when paxton's band of african trackers first encounter and pursue the larger-than-life primate ( in a scene unashamedly ripped off from "" the lost world : jurassic park "" ) . 

paxton jubilantly extols the beast's majestic gait at the same exact moment as joe , and the computer effects driving him , stutter to a halt . 

also , if the film's producers had wanted us to focus our attentions on the titular ape they shouldn't have paraded female lead charlize theron ( "" trial & error "" ) around in a seemingly-endless wardrobe of spaghetti-strapped tops . 

even joe seems distracted at times . 

the film piles on the clich ? s like there's no tomorrow , including the predictable plot ( anthro-zoologists ship gigantic gorilla to l . a . where urban havoc is inevitably wrought ) , predictable villain ( a lithuanian i think i overheard someplace ) , predictable love story ( bill and charlize--surprise ! ) , and predictable denouement ( "" 'twas box-office receipts that killed the beast "" ) . 

kids raised on "" men in black "" ( non-monkey effects also by baker ) are going to find ron ( "" tremors "" ) underwood's outing a little lame by comparison . 

while certainly better than 1978's "" king kong lives "" ( itself a lousy sequel to a not particularly good remake ) , "" mighty joe young "" proves how the mighty keep falling . 
"
"contrary to popular belief , not every single foregin film released to an american market is a masterpiece . 

some of them aren't even good . 

some examples of this principle are the aboslutely dreadful "" un indien dans la ville "" ( presented as "" little indian , big city , "" and remade into that crap tim allen flick , "" jungle2jungle "" ) , and this . 

what could have been a clever little sex comedy turns into one mess of a french flick . 

 "" french twist "" ( the "" cool "" american title , not the real one , which was "" gazon maudit , "" literally meaning "" twisted ground , "" or something like that ) deals with a married couple with kids , and the intrusion of a stranger who kinda screws things up for them . 

loli and alain chabat ( victoria abril and alain chabat ) are not exactly happily married . 

always on business trips , alain chabat more than once cheats on her , and she eventually finds out . 

and one day , she meets a butch mechanic , marijo ( the co-writer/director josiane balasko ) , and they two kinda hit it off . 

so she decides she will get back at alain chabat by doing the obvious : sleeping with marijo . 

but she soons starts to not only fall in love with marijo , but she's also realizes she's still in love with alain chabat . 

so , of course , she does the obvious from that : she decides to keep them both . 

she'll be ( and sleep ) with each of them for 3 days each , then on sunday , she'll rest by herself . 

after all , she needs it if she's gonna have more sex than sylvia kristel . 

the film goes on for over an hour and a half , through stupidity after stupidity , moronic twist after moronic twist , and soon there's the little ironic ( ! ! ! ) 

ending . 

i know it's a completely different culture , and i'm quite familiar with the french and their cinema , but this is just bad . 

none of the characters are more intelligent than peter stormare in "" fargo "" ( a movie where stupid characters were backed up to make a point ) , and any action they do is pretty much just to get a hopeful chuckle from the audience . 

what's shocking is this was not only one of france's biggest hits , but it was nominated for a lot of cesars ( french equivalent of oscars ) . 

the writing and directing is really the big problem with it . 

josiane balasko does a good acting job with her role , but her little sex comedy isn't very humerous , entertaining , or even deep at all . 

even woody allen's not-very-good "" a midsummer night's sex comedy "" is intelligent , well-written , and possesses some depth . 

this is shallow , unfunny , and pretty annoying to watch . 

the film moves at the pace of a snail , and is damn-near painful to watch . 

thank god for the fast forward button . 

the acting , however , isn't bad at all . 

the actors do the best they can with the bad material , and victoria abril is pretty likable despite the script ( and the fact that she's stupid enough to try to divide herself over two people when she has kids ) . 

and alain chabat has some funny moments as the neurotic husband . 

but "" french twist "" is just pretty lame . 

it's not overly horrible , and has a couple very , very , very brief moments . 

but it's just a really crap film , and an example of an ill-advised distribution of a foreign film . 
"
"the idea at the center of the devil's advocate , which is , thus far , one of the three or four best films of 1997 , is that no matter what decision is made , evil will triumph -- god is a trickster , satan is a humanist -- "" the last humanist "" . 

he appears in many guises , and seduces many men and women -- in his own words , "" vanity -- by far my favorite sin "" . 

al pacino plays this role with relish , and gets to chew some delectable lines ( "" lemme givya a piece o' inside wisdom on god . . . "" , "" i have a million names . . . "" ) , as john milton -- the devil . 

the main idea -- that he can appear as anyone , in any form ( in this case , a buisness man ) , harkens mainly back to terry gilliam's the time bandits . 

but the film , is something else , something original . 

part of what makes it so very good , is that it never takes itself too seriously -- it dabbles with morality , vanity , death , and child abuse , but doesn't try to become any profound study of power . 

this is a marvelous confection -- cocky , funny , thought provoking . 

it is also entertaining . 

there is no way you could possibly predict the ending -- it pulls back upon itself , drawing purely out of the mind's eye . 

the final shot is more creative , more daring , more challenging , then anything in cinema since the white sock in the coen's fargo . 

the central themes are fascinating ( sometimes reminiscent of james' the turn of the screw , and oates' accursed inhabitants of the house of bly ) , and the product that is built around it really wows . 

its nice to know that things like this are still being made . 
"
"have you ever wondered if death is something that simply happens naturally , at any given moment , in life ? 

or if it is an occurrence that is predetermined by some much larger force within the world , or outside of it ? 

these thought-provoking questions are the subject of "" final destination , "" which is the most riveting horror-drama since 1999's "" the sixth sense . "" 

stylishly filmed and tautly directed by "" x-files "" alum james wong , the film deals with several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters ( in accurately written "" teen-speak , "" rather than overwrought , highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars wouldn't use ) , all the while developing into a darkly foreboding , severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to the less-successful , but still suspenseful epilogue . 

at the start of the film , 17-year-old high school senior alex browning ( devon sawa ) is about to leave with his 40-student french class for a field trip to paris . 

progressively getting a case of preflight jitters , he spots several mysterious "" coincidences , "" including the departure time being 9 : 25 , the same as his september 25 birthday , as well as hearing the john denver song "" rocky mountain high "" over the sound system in the airport bathroom . 

 "" john denver died in a plane crash , "" alex grudgingly mutters to himself . 

once seated , alex suddenly gets a horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff , and after causing a ruckus onboard , he , as well as six other students and a teacher , are thrown off . 

arguing in the airport lobby , alex's suspicion comes true when the plane really does explode in flight , killing all 300+ passengers , including the rest of their classmates . 

as two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going to explode , the fellow survivors , whom he has saved , treat him in varying manners . 

carter ( kerr smith ) , the hotshot jock , holds him in contempt because he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate . 

alex's best friend , tod ( chad e . donella ) , wants to stand by him but can't because of his fearful parents . 

the teacher , mrs . lewton ( kristen cloke ) , is frightened by him , believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster , as well as in a state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane to a fellow coworker . 

only outsider clear rivers ( ali larter ) , who unboarded the plane due to a sudden connection to alex's premonition even though she had never even spoken to him before , is sympathetic and thankful to him for saving her life . 

that is only the setup of "" final destination , "" and the less said about what follows , the better . 

suffice to say , the film does , indeed , turn into a slasher film , albeit one that is more thoughtful than most , and replaces a knife-wielding maniac for the never-seen granddaddy killer of them all , the grim reaper itself . 

the setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes , and "" final destination "" surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace the silver screen in years . 

graphic and brilliantly orchestrated in a rube goldbergesque manner , they manage to occasionally be so intense you don't know whether to shrink down in your seat , tap your feet in nervousness , or turn away . 

devon sawa , a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in 1999's underseen slasher-comedy , "" idle hands , "" is even more of a charismatic presence here . 

the conflicting emotions he feels for his survival , which he comes to believe he wasn't meant to do , as well as the loss of the other passengers , is superbly and subtly acted on his part . 

one scene , in which he is watching a news report on the crash and slowly begins to break down is especially realistic and powerful . 

ali larter ( 1999's "" varsity blues "" ) , in the other central role , is also effective , as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a convenience store shooting years before , leaving her stuck with an increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish man--the exact opposite of her now-deceased father . 

the other roles are not as fully written , and most remain rather one-dimensional . 

the movie is mainly sawa's , however , and the rest of the actors equip themselves well in limited roles . 

tony todd ( 1992's "" candyman "" ) , as an arcane morgue attendant , pops up for a five-minute cameo , but his appearance is rather supererogatory . 

and the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye , while at other times it hovers over being just a little too stilted and campy . 

ultimately , what is so good about "" final destination "" is that , within the confines of the slasher genre , writer-director wong and screenwriters glen morgan and jeffrey reddick have created a premise that has never been seen before in this manner , and a film that has the ability to both surprise and frighten--two things that are rarely found in today's horror films . 

if anything , it's safe to say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way again . 
"
"there are some works of art that are almost impossible to review , not because of their own complexity , but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original . 

one of such masterpieces is casablanca , probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art , but definitely the most popular one . 

its popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half a century since its premiere , but also in countless tributes and references that movie makers use in their works to this day . 

casablanca is also a movie that has the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critics and loved by general audience . 

one of the things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that it was doomed to fail , at least judging by conventional movie-making wisdom of its time . 

it was based on a broadway play so mediocre that it hadn't been produced on stage ; screenplay by three writers - julius g . epstein , philip j . epstein and howard koch - was beeing written as shooting went along ; the main actors were producers' second choice , and , finally , man behind camera , michael curtiz was considered to be capable , but not great director . 

however , the movie was commercially successful and earned three "" oscars "" , including the one for the best film . 

until this very day , it is considered to be the best example of hollywood film- making in its own golden age . 

the plot of the movie was heavily influenced by the needs of ww2 propaganda , yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstances of that global conflict in order to make intriguing story . 

in december 1941 , casablanca , exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa is controlled by officially neutral , yet nazi-collaborating french vichy government . 

thousands of refugees from war-torn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america , and ready to pay any price for precious exit visas . 

many shady characters thrive on their misery , including the corrupt police chief , captain renault ( rains ) . 

his best friend is rick blaine ( bogart ) , who used to be idealistic anti-fascist , and now owns popular night club in casablanca and lives by his own cynical philosophy of "" sticking his neck for nobody "" . 

however , everything changes when he gets in possession of two precious extra visas . 

this event coincides with the arrival of two new refugees to casablanca . 

one of them is victor laszlo ( henreid ) , czech resistance leader who escaped three times from nazi concentration camps and became the legend of enslaved europe . 

he is accompanied by his beautiful wife ilsa lund ( bergman ) , with whom rick had a stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris . 

the couple needs visas , especially because of the gestapo major strasser ( veidt ) being on their trail . 

rick is now forced to choose between love , wounded pride , self-preserving interest and his own hatred of fascism . 

the casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration - humphrey bogart , most legendary actor in the history of cinema , is one of the rare character actors who elevated his persona to the star status . 

bogart's portrayal of rick as complicated man , torn between idealistic past and bitter present , was so perfect , that his icon would forever be connected with that character . 

another icon in his company is ingrid bergman , great actress of old hollywood , here in her artistic and visual prime . 

the cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbols of that era of filmmaking - some happier times when the romance on the screen didn't look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary works . 

for many people , casablanca is probably the best romantic film ever made . 

but the reason for that isn't the romance itself - it's the realistic story of people forced to make tough , and often wrong choices in their life . 

the casting of casablanca was right on target not just in a case of main leads . 

the supporting actors also did a marvellous job . 

sidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previous bogart classic - john huston's maltese falcon ; yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original characters . 

another shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid as the weakest part of love triangle ; character of victor laszlo has believable charisma and looks like a somebody who could inspire millions of people to rise against nazi tiranny . 

unfortunately , the charisma that burdened laszlo , leaves little place for difficult choice , making his character forever overshadowed by rick/ilsa coupling . 

however , rick and ilsa actually have a serious competiton for most memorable character in casablanca . 

captain renault , brilliantly portrayed by claude rains in a role of a lifetime , was embodiment of perfect , almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption and physical charm . 

despite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie , rains managed to make renault sympathetic character , and his final conversion to the side of good , symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary . 

rains also gave another dimension to the movie , making it even more ambiguous ; people who like to analyse movies to death discovered signs of homosexuality in renault's relationship towards rick , and rick's final words leave room for even more outrageous speculations . 

together with well-drawn characters and exciting story , the movie was good in creating his own atmosphere . 

professional nitpickers would probably have a field day in discovering numerous historical and geographical inaccuracies , but casablanca is still a shining example of hollywood ww2 movie that is beliavable , if not realistic . 

any way , even if we don't see it as a historical document , casablanca is movie that can be source of entertainment as well as infinite inspiration .

"what a great film . 

what a stunning , touching , heart-wrenching , heart-warming , life-affirming , miraculous film . 

>from its opening moments , _life is beautiful_ walks that fine line between serious tragedy and uplifting comedy . 

a car with no brakes speeds through the town , and guido ( roberto benigni ) motions people to move out of the way . 

they mistake him to be the fascist president , traveling to their town that day . 

heil ! 

heil ! 

huh ? 

shortly thereafter , the president drives through , and people stare , with blank faces . 

this is standard , but somehow fresh and postmodern stuff : the clown who is also a jew , triumphs over the anti-semitic society in which he = lives . 

granted , _the great dictator_ comes to mind--charlie chaplin+s almost masterpiece . 

i think lib ( which benigni wrote and directed ) trumps gd in one essential point : chaplin+s jewish barber gives a great speech at the climax , but to do so , he had to break completely from character . 

benigni is given a similar situation : he is mistaken as a fascist dignitary , and must explain to a classroom filled with schoolchildren = on how scientists have concluded that aryans are the superior race . 

benigni+s guido stays in character , and delivers the speech , keeping = the subject matter intact while showing the absurdity of its concept . 

it = is one of the great satirical scenes in modern cinema . 

there are many other scenes , especially in the first half , which are bright and loopy and funny and silly . 

slapstick reigns , and although the film is subtitled , there was no doubt that a universal language was being conveyed . 

and although it+s focus is on the courtship of guido = to dora ( played by nicoletta braschi , benigni+s real life wife ) , a silent undercurrent creeps in . 

this is clearly a racist society , evidenced by the aforementioned scene and others , and it will soon affect him and = his family . 

the second half of the film takes place five years later , in an unnamed concentration camp , where guido , dora ( by her insistence ) , and their five-year old son , giosu=e9 ( giorgio cantarini ) , are deported . 

guido , seeing the horrors , is desperate to protect his wife and child . 

for = his wife , who is separated from him , he must find ways to communicate to = her that he is all right . 

for his son , ( and this is the most controversial part of the film ) he convinces the youngster that this is all one big elaborate game : it+s rules include hiding , being very quiet , and learning to not ask for seconds . 

which raises the big questions : how do we deal with pain ? 

with persecution ? 

with injustice on the worst level ? 

it+s said that tragedies bring out the best in people , finding strengths they did not realize they had . 

other times they deteriorate , become overwhelmed = with little strength or incentive to swim . 

sometimes even , people giggle in these moments , as if there were a vacant emotion behind them , yearning for some brightness to soothe their wounds . 

benigni+s guido realizes this . 

he is the clown , but he is not a fool . 

he sees the slurs and the vandalism , and while feeling the weight of = the verbal attacks , he still has the audacity to see if everyone around = him , perhaps even the antagonists , laugh . 

his liberty is stripped , but not his dignity , and certainly not the dignities of those around him . 

it+s obvious from the onset that here is someone who is very much against fascism and the preposterousness of an aryan nation , but does so with a grinning , joyful demeanor . 

perhaps that is a form of denial . 

perhaps his alternate reality is all that he could muster ( not unlike the very different _brazil_ ) . 

or . . . 

perhaps this is an example of great fortitude , with no weapons but = wit . 

whatever his purposes is subject to debate , but also a sure sign that this is one of the great three-dimensional characters , stranded amidst = a terrifyingly risky concept . 

surprisingly , it works . 

it is an important footnote that this film was not intended to be an accurate reflection of the holocaust . 

it+s not that the atrocities are trivialized , far from it . 

they don+t have to be broadcast and explicitly shown to muster the same horror--less is more . 

i believe = that benigni was cautious to preserve the tone , and i like the theory that = it is guido+s alternate reality that we+re seeing . 

however , any criticism that this is rewriting history , that the holocaust wasn+t as bad as it seems , is simply off-target . 

benigni+s film has won audience awards at cannes , at toronto , and is a definite shoo-in for best foreign language film ( hopefully for best picture as well ) . 

he has been made an honorary jew by a jerusalem film society . 

it swept the italian academy awards . 

controversy notwithstanding , it is one of the great films this year , and as of this writing , the one to beat for best film .

beauty . 

so what happens when you put these two people in the same room and come out with a movie co-starring the ever-versatile lisa kudrow ? 

uhhhm , you guessed it . . . not 

much . 

plot : in order to escape major financial difficulties , a local weatherman hooks up with his ball-picking lotto girlfriend and rigs the state lottery . 

but as more and more people find out about their scheme , more and more people demand a part of their winnings , and more and more problems arise . 

critique : simply stated , i didn't laugh once during this entire picture . 

for a comedy , it offered me a few smiles , a bunch of nincompoops as characters , a miscast john travolta hamming it up and lisa kudrow , in what can only described as a "" sluttier "" version of her character of phoebe on tv's "" friends "" . 

this film was not as disastrous as i thought it would be , but it was pretty close . 

thankfully , the clips of travolta dressed up in goofy outfits , dancing as the weatherman were left in the film's trailer , and not in this final cut . 

and not unlike the worst movie of the year so far , beautiful , this film also managed to feature many unsympathetic , idiotic and just plain irritating characters in its cast . 

foremost was travolta's character , who declined to give us any reason to care for him once in the entire movie . 

and for me , the casting choice of john travolta for this role was just plain wrong . 

he didn't fit the part . 

i just saw him in get shorty the other day and thought about how perfect he was for that role . 

a cool , calculating roughneck with a certain hip , suave "" je ne sais quoi "" . 

in this film , he looks like he's trying to be funny , trying to be bad , trying to be good . 

we're not supposed to be able to notice that , and when we do , at least in my case , i consider it a wrong choice in casting . 

add that to lisa kudrow , boring us with yet another one of her patented "" dumb blonde "" routines , but this time , dressed in sexier outfits . 

michael rapaport , stretching one small acting muscle to play the guy who isn't quite up at the same speed level as everyone else . 

and a truckload of empty comedic bullet shells , and you've got yourself an extremely quiet audience anticipating punch lines that never quite materialize . 

the only real good thing that i could say about this film is that its story was actually half-interesting and never really bored me . 

i also liked michael moore's perverted cousin character , and i loved , and i say it again , loved the character that bill pullman played . 

give this dude his own movie ! 

he played a lazy cop , a man who tries everything not to do any real work . 

he fakes injuries to get off duty , tries to avoid arrest situations so that he won't have to fill out any forms . . . now 

there's a base of humor . 

sadly , the filmmakers decided to bring him into play with only about half an hour left in the film . 

and there's not much else i can say about this movie , folks . 

on the whole , it was lame , included a slew of unlikable characters fiddling around in a pool of unfunny lines , and very little of interest for any target audience . 

but get somebody to write up a movie featuring that lazy cop played by pullman and i'm there ! 
"
"the best thing -- in fact , the only good thing -- i can say about dark city is that it made me want to go see l . a . confidential again . 

or go rent body heat , to see william hurt do some real noir . 

or even -- god help me -- palmetto . 

alex proyas's new movie screams atmosphere . 

i screamed , too , "" get me out of this theater ! "" 

new line cinema spent millions of dollars creating the expressionistic film noir visuals and paying the actors , and doesn't have any way to get it back . 

i paid $4 . 25 for a matinee screening and don't have any way to get my money back , either . 

you'll hear a lot from other critics about the look and feel of this movie . 

i will admit that the cinematographers and costume designers and set artists and cgi graphics geeks all worked hard to create a stunning , nightmarish future world where it's always a late night in 1948 , complete with rotary phones and automats and fedoras . 

i've got news for you fellows -- i don't care how hard you worked , or how visually stunning this movie looks -- you wasted your time and mine , working on a movie without a plot , without a clear sense of direction of where it wanted to go , without a soul or a reason to care . 

the movie starts out oh-so-promising . 

john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) is lying in a bathtub in the sort of seedy hotel that in real life , would have been boarded up long ago . 

there is a dead , mutilated prostitute in the other room -- a surprise , as he has lost his memory . 

the phone rings : it's a sinister-sounding man , claiming to be his doctor , telling him to flee for his life . 

all well and good , right ? 

wrong . 

apparently , someone decided that the audience was just a bit too dim to figure out the intricacies of the plot . 

 ( this is getting to be a popular assumption in hollywood . ) 

so , the actual beginning of the movie is not sewell running for his life , rather , it's a voice-over narration by the aforementioned doctor ( keifer sutherland ) explaining exactly what is going on and who is responsible . 

it's as though sam the piano player had told us that rick and ilsa had been getting it on in paris in the first three minutes of casablanca . 

no , wait , that's not fair to casablanca . 

it's more like watching a new plotline at the first of the show -- or if you want to know how i really feel , having an off-screen narrator explain that gilligan won't be getting off the island in this episode . 

>from here , the coherence of the plot goes down faster than ( insert monica lewinsky joke here ) . 

the characters just wander around the city aimlessly and bump into each other for no apparent reason , and that's what moves the plot . 

what we're left with is a string of unanswered questions that don't make any sense . 

we're given aliens with unlimited omnipotent powers , yet they forget to use them at critical moments and get themselves killed . 

we're given a hero who can "" tune "" into these same powers , yet he only uses them when it's convenient to the plot . 

we're given a whole long list of loose ends that go nowhere 

usually , critics will say that an actor playing an underwritten part "" isn't given much to do . "" 

in this movie , no one is given anything to do . 

sewell is given the impossible role of a man who doesn't remember anything , and plays it like . . . 

um . . . 

a man who doesn't remember anything . 

the aliens are tall , pasty-faced , and bald , and wear long black cloaks and fedoras to remind us that they're evil -- and there's a child alien as well , straight out of an anne rice novel . 

sutherland is saddled with a limp , a twitchy eye , and a breathy accent to remind us that he's in league with the aliens . 

to its credit , dark city boasts two impressive bits of casting . 

william hurt is perfectly cast as the world-weary inspector charged with catching the man who is murdering prostitutes all over the city . 

jennifer connelly , playing sewell's love interest , is given two all-too-brief moments on screen as a lounge singer -- and turns in the sexiest performace this side of jessica rabbit . 

but instead of the dogged policeman and the femme fatale given central treatment in the script ( the way they would be in any self-respecting noir movie ) they're almost tangiential to the plot , such as it is . 

the problem with dark city is this : it's a bad science fiction movie pretending to be film noir . 

the essence of film noir isn't , as proyas seems to beleive , breathy dialogue or snap-brim fedoras or tall , bald evil villains who would make peter lorre curl up in a corner . 

dark city has not one bit of intrigue , moral ambiguity , suspense , or anything else that keeps us coming back to the noir classics . 

dark city is like the intricately carved door that kate winslet floats on in titanic . 

it's an exceptionlly well-made and intricately designed piece of flotsam , sailing around and around the middle of the ocean , going nowhere .

"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . 

be forewarned . 

on december 20 , 1996 , amidst all the year-end oscar bait releases from the major studios , miramax's genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream . 

although the teen horror market had been given up for all-but-dead in recent years , the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns , eventually topping $100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history , while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre . 

the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly , everybody was looking for hip , inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes . 

the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost . 

scream director wes craven , previously best known as the creator of new line's a nightmare on elm street film series , was thrust back into the limelight . 

and scream's rookie scribe , kevin williamson , burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion . 

it's hard to understate this last point . 

mr . williamson has , based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing ( scream , i know what you did last summer from october 1997 , and now scream 2 ) , enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame , quickly become the most well-known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly-reading , box office figure-watching youth culture since -- well , since that quentin tarantino guy ( whom , it is said , has also achieved some renown as a director ) . 

indeed , in a singularly freakish oddity , it is the screenwriter , mr . williamson , and not the director that has been receiving the lion's share of acclaim for the success of scream , and the print advertisements for scream 2's theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence : while the traditional "" a film by wes craven "" drapes the film's title in the ads , right below it ( in equal sized font , yet ) reads "" written by kevin williamson "" , an affirmation of the screenwriter's contribution to the project which may be unprecedented . 

 ( i can envision the board of wga , licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of "" a film by "" is attained . ) 

and , much like mr . tarantino's screenwriting , mr . williamson's work is vaguely unconventional , incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters . 

in scream , they satirically discussed other horror films ; here in the sequel , the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels . 

scream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood , and mr . williamson's rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel . 

while the sequel was planned from the outset -- a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr . williamson sold the screenplay for scream -- the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived , and it's only at about the film's midway point when it becomes engaging . 

like its predecessor , scream 2 opens with a splashy , eye-grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film's principal narrative ; this time around , we're following the exploits of a young couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab ( a running film-within-a-film gag where the "" true life "" events behind the first film has been turned into a movie ) . 

however , although it tries hard and has some good ideas -- the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with , and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overly-noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes -- the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore ( where her performance not only convinced me that she * could * act , but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i've ever seen ) . 

there are too many knowing , hip pop-culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence , and the setup isn't nearly as cleverly frightening as scream's ; while the first film's preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying , the payoff here is almost campily theatrical . 

flash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college , where returning characters sidney ( neve campbell ) and randy ( jamie kennedy ) have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film . 

the murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors -- single-minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) roars into town to cover the breaking story , while ever-awkward former deputy dewey riley ( david arquette ) flies in to protectively guard over sidney . 

they're joined by cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film ; his role here is significantly expanded . 

the film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory , although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isn't necessary -- not because so many people have seen the first installment , but because this is , after all , a sequel to a slasher film : what do you * think * happened to these characters in the prior movie ? 

there's a lot of new faces on the scene too : sidney's new boyfriend , derek ( jerry o'connell ) and her new roommate hallie ( elise neal ) , randy's fellow film student mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , gale's newly-assigned nervous cameraman joel ( duane martin ) , omnipresent local journalist debbie salt ( laurie metcalf ) , co-ed cici cooper ( ms . buffy herself , sarah michelle gellar ) , and a pair of simpering sorority sisters ( rebecca gayheart and sirens' portia di rossi ) . 

any of these characters could be the killer -- or for that matter , could be the next victim . 

as is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay , the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly-flimsy premise of a whodunit . 

one problem that scream didn't have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer . 

here ( and to some extent in i know what you did last summer ) , mr . williamson's screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery . 

the film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements . 

 ( it doesn't help matters any that the killer's alter-ego is fairly obvious from the get-go . ) 

indeed , the finale plays as full-out camp when the villain is finally unmasked , frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes . 

this is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations , scheming , and motivation , that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it . 

while the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived , the aspect where it's head-and-shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences . 

they're staged much more imaginatively here ( save for the first post-prologue murder , which is handled in such a mediocre , conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film satirized ) , and are much more fun to watch . 

it's hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck , and a cat-and-mouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged , although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown . 

in terms of its characters , the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey ( who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music ) . 

their verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour -- an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is well-written -- and there's a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed . 

on the other hand , sidney is pretty dull here . 

she doesn't have any compelling presence , and there's nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that she's the returning heroine . 

given this , and the fact that there's no strong second banana character for sidney ( elise neal's role isn't nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowan's shoes ) , it's no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film . 

what surprises me the most about scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast . 

the film's mounting body count bears out the fact that * no * character is safe ( well , * almost * ) ; while in principal i applaud this bold policy , at some point you've got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel . 

 ( i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular , whose casting for the next installment of the series would've seemed obvious . ) 

but hey , as rose mcgowan's character said in the first film : "" no , please don't kill me , mr . ghostface -- i want to be in the sequel ! "" 

look what that got her . 
"
"this is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it just happens to be animated . 

there are some great voice over commentaries from hollywood's most famous celebrities , some fabulous animation and a compelling story . 

this is the best we've seen from disney since "" beauty and the beast "" ( 1996 ) . 

this film begins an unspecified time following the happily-ever-after conclusion to toy story . 

in the aftermath of their earlier adventures , buzz ( voice of tim allen ) and woody ( voice of tom hanks ) are now fast friends and all the toys live in perfect harmony , content with their "" lives "" . 

one day , andy broke woody's arm off , while playing with him . 

woody is now officially discarged and worthless , left with his nightmares , where he lies in a trash can with the other discards . 

later andy's mother decides to have a yard sale , and she collects a few old toys from her son's room . 

since one of these discards is a member of the moving toy gang , woody goes to the rescue , leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back . 

although his mission is successful , he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy collector named al ( voice of wayne knight ) spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the sale . 

the cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old tv series , "" woody's roundup . "" 

if he can acquire woody , al can ship everything to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit . 

so , after andy's mother refuses to sell the wooden cowboy , al steals him , and it's up to the other toys , led by buzz , to go into the city to save their friend . 

and so , buzz , rex ( voice of wallace shawn ) , hamm ( voice of john ratzenberger ) , mr . potatohead ( voice of don rickles ) , and slinky ( voice of jim varney ) , go out on a dangerous journey to rescue their friend , they find themselves confronting things like busy streets and other buzz lightyear toys . 

there are car chases , gun fights and finally the confrontation between buzz and his nemesis ( who , by the way , resembles darth vader ) . 

meanwhile , woody learns that he was once a tv celebrity and has a family - a cowgirl named jessie ( voice of joan cusack ) , a horse named bullseye , and a father figure called the prospector ( voice of kelsey grammar ) . 

they offer him another life , as a celebrity -- a toy in a museum in japan . 

he is now forced to choose between being loved intensively by andy for a little while ( before he grows up ) and be forgotten , or be admired by children for generations . 

the problem is , if woody escapes from al's clutches and returns home , they will end up back in the lonely darkness of storage . 

a real effort is made in the technical department . 

the animation is rich and colorful , with lots of wonderful details . the "" cinematography "" is also extremely improved since toy story ; there are a lot of complicated swings , turns and close-ups that really make an impression . 

lighting and filters are used to create a mood ( as in a surprisingly emotional moment - jessie's remembrance of her days when she was a beloved toy ) the film contains a lot of in-side jokes ( such as the one about videogames ) , and entertaining parodies on "" jurassic park "" and "" star wars "" . 

the film ends with the "" failed takes "" , the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on tv . 

these outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in the film . 

but what in the end makes "" toy story 2 "" a memorable experience is not the jokes , its multiple parodies or marvelous animation . 

it is its heart and emotions -- the story about the meaning of friendship , love and even life itself . 

it is not difficult to predict that "" toy story 2 "" would be a huge economical success , but its artistic achievement was unexpected . 

unexpected because the first film wasn't much more than a demonstration of special effects . 

but mostly it was unexpected because disney hasn't produced anything spectacular in years and is constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks and warner brs . 

but here the director has changed the atmosphere of the film , making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that 9 years . 

this is a big step-away from the ancient laws of disney-animation . 

off course , this is not "" antz "" , it is not as intelligent ; this is not a landmark and no masterpiece , but i promise that you'll find it as funny and enjoyable as i have . 

whether this is the best animated film of the year , i dare not say . 

my choice would probably be "" the iron giant "" , but ( along side with "" american pie "" ) this is the comedy of the year . 

i almost lost my hopes for disney , but "" toy story 2 "" proves that disney hasn't lost their ability to entertain . 
"
"long ago , films were constructed of strong dialogue , original characters , memorable plot points , and solid acting . 

one of the best examples that hollywood now completely ignore these qualities is found in the new film where the heart is . 

this opus about the power of love and the redemption of family follows the tragic , and i mean tragic , life of novalee nation ( natalie portman ) . 

hitting the road with her hick , guitar-playing boyfriend in a rusted-out gm , novalee dreams of the blue skies of bakersfield and sipping chocolate milk beneath a plastic umbrella with her unborn baby , due in a month . 

stopping off at a nearby wal-mart for a quick rest , novalee's boyfriend decides to take off and leaves her there . 

novalee then decides to secretly hole up in the wal-mart ( because she's not the brightest bulb in the stagelights ) . 

a wacky librarian ( keith david ) comes to her rescue when she goes into labor one night while she is camped in the outdoors section of the store . 

then the she moves in with a family , befriends everyone in town -- including ashley judd's character ( who has five kids and still can work part-time as a nurse ) -- fights off religious freaks , survives a tornado , breaks the heart of the wacky librarian that saved her , receives an inheritance , builds a martha stewart-esque house , becomes an award-winning photographer , and manages to always look like she stepped out of a cosmo shoot , all while not once doing anything with her kid . 

this film is terrible . 

the directing is awful : it seems director matt williams had an index card with six angles written on it and used every one of them , over and over and over again . 

we get pathetic and ugly acting by natalie portman , who can do good work . 

a disjointed pacing of key scenes and a time structure so confusing that it would throw steve prefontaine off . 

a subplot that actually validates the actions of the boyfriend who abandoned novalee in the wal-mart parking lot . 

an embarrassing display of emotions by the characters , making the audience ill . 

taking two great comedic screenwriters , babaloo mandel and lowell ganz , and forcing them to write drama on par with oprah's book club . 

altogether , it has the feeling of being trapped at home , watching a very bad television mini-series and wishing it to end , only the remote is broken . 

however , the main problem with the film is that it never answers the most poignant question brought up : where is the heart ? 

no one ever seems to find it in this piece of junk . 
"
"an entertaining 2 hours awaits the audience in this film set in the early 80's . 

sevigny and beckinsale play disco chicks alice and charlotte , who are on the lookout for love . 

alice is mousy , shy , intellectual , charlotte is bitchy , out-going and fun . 

we join their adventures as they go through a variety of adventures , and men , all to the background of the local disco . 

whit stillman has both written and directed an interesting and believable story . 

alice and charlotte are both well written characters , and the actresses who play them aren't bad aswell . 

sevigny delivers an honest performance , and makes the audience feel for her character . 

beckinsale plays extreme bitch personified , yet her character never becomes completely unlikeable . 

the huge supporting cast also play a part in making sure this movie is thoroughly entertaining . 

the dialogue is sharp and well written , with many funny set pieces . 

for example , there's a great discussion about lady & the tramp by the main characters . 

the disco tunes playing in the background also make sure that this admittedly long film is good fun . 

the direction is good , bringing out the drama and comedy in the scenes . 

but their are slight flaws with the movie . 

firstly , although it is supposedly set in the 80's , the characters are very , very 90's . 

the way they dress and act have a very 90's feel to them . 

although the male hairstyles look slightly 80's , frankly the 80's atmosphere just wasn't conveyed , which is a shame . 

also , as mentioned above , the film is too long , and some parts do lag . 

the charm of the characters do help these moments , but generally the editing could of been a bit tighter . 

the plot also side-tracks into a silly cocaine dealing bust , which seemed out of place in this movie . 

finally , their are almost too many characters in the film , and despite the running time , the film never really spends enough time on them . 

some of the characters are very slight , which is a shame . 

the conclusion , while funny , is also surprisingly weak , and certainly not strong enough . 

but despite these qualms , the last days of disco is a funny , warm movie , which is certainly worth seeing , and is a fitting homage to the disco era of the 80's . 

worth a look .
