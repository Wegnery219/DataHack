"capsule : dumb dud of an entry in the body heat sweepstakes , and now something of a landmark for having spawned a jillion clones . 

basic instinct's worst crime is that it's not just a bad movie , but in many ways , an incompetent one as well . 

it's stupid in itself , and stupid to think its audience is as stupid as it is . 

it's supposed to be a thriller , but the plot is dead on its feet , and ultimately arbitrary ; it's only put into the movie to jerk us around . 

it's also supposed to be sexy , but it's instead got the unpleasant rawness of a teenager showing younger kids his collections of dirty pictures . 

it's a ripoff . 

the story opens with a rock star being murdered while in the throes of orgasm . 

the biggest suspect is an authoress , catherine tramell ( sharon stone ) , who wrote a novel in which the murder was eerily presaged . 

or maybe it's the work of a copycat ? 

these and other plot threads get fed to the detective who's on the case ( michael douglas ) , who has a few problems himself . 

like we wonder if his elevator goes to the top floor . 

we can measure with a stopwatch the time from them setting eyes on each other to the moment they are doing the mattress dance . 

joe eszterhas has written the screenplay , and he uses a device that he used before in the much better jagged edge : the killer's identity is kept a secret until the movie's final shot . 

this isn't in itself a problem -- the problem is that up until that point , we've been given nothing to work with . 

every clue in the movie -- every clue -- is ambiguous . 

the whole thriller aspect of the movie is a shill . 

red herrings , dead plot threads , violence , and kinky sexuality litter the movie like potholes in manhattan streets . 

they add up to zip , because they're not happening to people we care about . 

douglas's character is foulmouthed and bitter and that's it ; stone's character has an iron-on smile that never changes ; the rest are forgettable . 

when we don't even have the luxury of giving a damn about anyone in the movie , who cares what happens in it ? 

especially with an ending that is not only unsatisfying , but in many ways inexplicable ? 

 ( a friend of mine once came up with a rule of thumb about movie characters : "" if no one in the movie behaves like anyone you know , or would * care * to know , just leave ! "" ) 

one of the nastier things about the movie is the way it treats lesbianism not as an integral part of someone's life , but as a kind of kink -- something to thrill men with . 

i despair whenever i encounter this kind of stupidity in mainstream entertainment ; are we still so culturally neanderthal that the only way to include something like that in a big-budget hollywood film is as a hefnerism ? 
"
"that is , unless you're one of those people who have seen the preview a thousand times on tv or in the theaters . 

i can tell you one thing now : they gave the entire movie away . 

why someone would want to base an entire movie on one premise and then give that crucial detail away in the trailers is beyond me . 

however , if they * hadn't * given it away , the film would've still been suprisingly devoid of suspense given its subject matter . 

obviously , the producers thought they could remake "" the deep end of the ocean , "" throw in tommy lee jones and a couple of cliches and call it an action drama . 

 "" double jeopardy "" offers solid acting from ashley judd and tommy lee jones , who got first billing even though he didn't see to be on screen half as much as judd did . 

it also offers some genuinely funny , clever , or full-of-tension moments ( my favorite : judd waking up in the coffin ) , but none of that can salvage the film from its insanely predictable plot . 

half the time i'm wondering whether i'm watching one of those overhyped tv miniseries , which always turn out to be less exciting than advertised . 

judging by the beginning , end , and a huge chunk of the middle , i might have been watching a special hallmark presentation too . 

the movie's stretching for an almost two hour long film with only 30 minutes worth of material . 

implausible material , no less . 

loose interpretation of one of the amendments aside , too many times in the movie i thought , "" that is * not * possible * . "" 

that kind of stuff is excusable in popcorn movies , but not one like "" double jeopardy "" that tries to pass itself off as serious drama . 

everything seems dragged out , overplayed . 

when they should've kept us in the dark , they let the cat out of the bag too early . 
"
"for his directoral debut , gary oldman chose a highly personal family drama about a violent , alcoholic husband and father , and the various lives he affects . 

but while the characters , places and events may have special meaning to the writer-director , the audience is left in the dark . 

the center of this tale is the abusive raymond ( ray winstone ) , and the film focuses on him and the people who orbit around him . 

he spends his days hanging out with his friends at pubs and girlie bars . 

then , he returns home to his pregnant wife , valerie ( kathy burke ) and their five-year-old daughter . 

raymond demonstrates his violent tendencies ( and his paranoid delusions ) early on when he accuses valerie's brother , billy ( charlie creed-miles ) , of stealing . 

raymond then proceed to beat ( and bite ) him to a bloody wreck . 

but these are the least of billy's problems . 

billy is a heroin addict on the downturn , and it doesn't seem that he'll last much longer . 

billy and valerie's mother , janet ( laila morse ) , is raymond's nemesis . 

she disapproves of him ( and he of her ) , but is powerless to do anything about it . 

she merely struggles on , hoping her children will survive their respective torments . 

if this description seems bleak , i haven't told the half of it . 

this is not a cheery movie , and most of the time it's downright depressing . 

while at times it is interesting to watch to see just what makes raymond tick , and why no one ever simply calls the cops on him , in the end , it's not quite worth it . 

there are too many scenes which randomly dot the picture with little or no purpose . 

take for example the extended sequence where one of billy's scuzzy friends defends a stray puppy . 

the film is filled with these "" character moments "" that never really achieve anything . 

granted , there are a few genuinely powerful ( and sickening ) moments in the film , but their expression seems to be more of a catharsis for the creator than us . 

the actors do a fine job , particularly in the central roles . 

the good thing about an actor turned writer is that oldman knows how to write good scenes , and the actors in nil by mouth have some meat they can tear into . 

the bad thing about an actor turned director is that there's no one to restrain oldman from making poor choices . 

a good character drama should mean something to those involved in making the film and the audience . 

oldman got it about half right .

"first troy beyer wrote the critically panned "" b . a . p . s . "" 

now she makes her directorial debut , writing , directing , and starring in this sub-par film about women talking about sex . 

though not without redeeming qualities , this film is bad . 

the basic story follows three single friends -- jazz ( beyer ) , lena ( randi ingerman ) , and michelle ( paget brewster ) -- in their search for love . 

jazz has an idea for a local talk show ; it would feature women talking about sex and dating . 

she and her friends make a demo tape of interviews with the women of miami . 

the film itself is sprinkled with these real interviews throughout , both as part of the plot and as commentary on the situations of the main characters . 

the fact that they are real provides a refreshing break from some of the more melodramatic moments in the film . 

there are several moments of bad acting , corny dialogue , and emotional overextension . 

in a low-budget independent film from a first-time director , these faults can sometimes be forgiven , if the screenplay is fresh and solid . 

that is not the case here . 

the script suffers from random plot developments . 

there are four or five of these turns in the plot , each one raising the question "" where did that come from ? "" 

at one point , a character has a lifelong reconciliation with her mother . 

we are supposed to be moved , but since the scene is completely un-led-up to , we really don't care if she and her mother get along . 

we've never seen her mother before . 

we never see her again . 

who cares ? 

what's worse , these sudden developments are supposed to engage our sympathy . 

at another point , a character announces that she can't have children . 

apparently , this is devastating . 

we wouldn't know this because she never talked about having kids before , but we are nevertheless expected to be devastated for her . 

the scene feels like an afterthought , its emotion manipulative and shallow . 

these scenes grow worse and worse , culminating in an absurd climax . 

two scenes were played with such overwhelming melodrama that i found myself laughing . 

one scene is a lover's spat between two minor characters . 

the other has the main characters expressing their copious grief by cleaning house in wails of despair and clouds of ajax . 

thinking on these scenes , it is hard for me to admit that the film has redeeming qualities . 

but it does . 

first , it is original . 

we men often wonder what women talk about when they are alone in groups , and i imagine this film gives me a pretty good idea . 

it's something i don't think has been the subject of a film . 

second , the interviews of the miami women are sincere . 

taken together , they form a mosaic picture of miami beachwalkers and bistro diners . 

the mosaic is made of sound bites and stereotypes , but each tile is some woman's real experience . 

neither the picture of women , nor their picture of men , is truly representative , but the point is that both sets of generalizations are telling in their own way . 

at some level , the stereotypes that emerge can be called true . 

i can imagine some people liking this film when its characters talk about their "" likes , dislikes , skills , and thrills , "" but on the whole , it's pretty bad . 

and that makes it even harder to forgive the bad acting , corny dialogue , and emotional overextension . 

i'll give beyer one more strike , and then she's out . 

rated r ( almost got an nc-17 ) for explicit sexual dialogue and nudity . 
"
"this has some major spoilers for the film , so be forwarned . 

the won't appear till later in the article , so you're safe for now . 

eyes wide shot ( 1999 ) running time : 2 hours 39 minutes 2 . 35 : 1 theatrical aspect 

starring : tom cruise ( dr . 

bill hardford ) , nicole kidman ( alice hardford ) , sidney pollack , leelee sobieski , todd field ( nick nightingale ) directed , co-written , produced by : stanley kubrick inspired by : "" traumnovelle "" by : arthur schnitzer 

this is an interesting film . 

i must first off state , that you musn't believe any of the rumors of the film . 

cruise is not a cross dresser , kidman doesn't shoot heroin , and there's not any scene between the two that would suggest that they were aided by a sex therapist . 

the look of the film is to suggest that it follows the translation of the inspired book from the film was written . 

the translation , "" dream novel , "" makes you thing that the film should have been titled dream film . 

there is a noticable amount of graininess to the film . 

rather than complain about it as some may and already have , see it as a style of shooting . 

i would gather that kubrick got on another lighting kick shooting this and shot with as much natural light as he could . 

this and the film looks like it was pushed another two stops to add more grain and brighten it slightly . 

as an auteur and stickler for details , kubrick seemed to be a bit lax on this one . 

the film looks great , but there are a good deal of bloopers/flubs that occur . 

you see lots of boom shots ( in reflection ) and you see the camera at least twice . 

16 months for this ? 

wow . 

reflection is the biggest killer for this film . 

their apartment and almost everything in the film casts reflections and the crew can be seen in these , some quite glaringly . 

one more topic of heated discussion : i saw the "" austin powers "" version , and to be perfectly frank , unless you know where the overlays are supposed to be , you'll probably not see them . 

two girls standing next to each other look a little suspicious , but i can wait for the unrated version on video to see it the way it's supposed to be . 

spoilers below : 

the film itself starts with ( cruise ) bill and ( kidman ) alice getting ready for a little x-mas soiree . 

they go to a quite elegant party in what seems to be a storagehouse for lighting equipment , which is actually an apartment owned by pollack . 

bill runs into an old friend from medical school who is now the party's entertainment . 

soon after , bill and alice are flirting with others at the party , thinking that the other has not noticed . 

bill is called to help with a partygoer who has had a bit too much of a good time . 

the next day , bill and alice , casually smoking marijunana in their bedroom discuss the previous nights flirtations . 

they both discover that they both knew about the flirting . 

bill starts talking about what women can provide in a relationship , and gets alice extremely angry . 

in her hazy state , she tells of an opportunity she almost acted on to cheat on bill , not caring about the possible aftereffects . 

bill gets called away when one of his patients dies , and goes to console his daughter . 

when his patient's engaged daughter makes a plea for his love and affection , he is struck with images of an affair that never occured between his wife , alice and a naval officer . 

he sees "" opportunity "" as a betrayal to his wife , and before they can continue , they are interrupted . 

as he strolls home , he encounters a hooker . 

seeing another "" opportunity "" arise , he follows the hooker home . 

they toy around , but before the act ensues , alice calls his cell phone . 

he breaks the date with the hooker , and heads back out into the night . 

he passes a lounge and notices that his old medical school buddy is playing , so he heads in . 

when he meets the friend , the friend reveals that for extra scratch , he plays these strange parties , while blindfolded . 

bill is intrigued and wants to go to one . 

nick reluctantly sets him up with directions and a password . 

what follows this is a short meeting where bill obtains a costume for this party and meets a young girl , leelee sobieski , and her father . 

the young girl has drawn his eye , but her young age , and the prescence of her father deter this from happening . 

he gets to the party , which is to say the least , a strange affair . 

after partaking in some strange "" religious "" right , women and men pair off for the orgy to end all orgies . 

a woman warns bill in disguise , that he should leave before he is exposed as a fraud at the party . 

he is detained after a second warning , where he is outed for not being in the group . 

after getting home , he hides the evidence of his evenings events . 

unable to carry on in his day , he tries piece the events of the previous night together . 

in the process , he finds that nick has disappeared , his life is possibly in danger , and the woman that warned him has died . 

i'm trying to save a bit of the film here , it's worth sitting through to get to this point . 

this is only about 100 minutes at this point . 

this is a strange film , because despite the events that occur , the film has a strong family message behind it . 

it will be hard to pidgeonhole this film as a certain kind of a film . 

it's got sex in it , it has nudity , drugs , and many more immoralistic values . 

but they all serve to show why they are bad in one's life . 

i recommend this film highly on many merits . 

cruise and kidman are rarely together for longer than 5 minutes after the opening scene , and the secrecy that shrouded the film should hopefully be apparent as to why it was kept once you see it for yourself .

"phaedra cinema , the distributor of such never-heard-of classics as "" soft toilet seats , "" "" trailer : the movie , "" and "" the one armed boxer vs . the flying guillotine , "" has sneaked its latest release , "" the sculptress , "" into a few theaters this weekend hoping to cash in on a handful of halloween holidaygoers looking for a right good scare . 

 "" the sculptress "" is a scary proposition all right , but not in the way its producers intended . 

from the outset it's easy to see why some of the larger , more reputable chains aren't carrying it : the film looks like a straight-to-video release from the early '80s that's been dusted off ( not very carefully ) and re-issued in theatrical format . 

that staple of schlocky z-movies jeff fahey ( "" the lawnmower man "" ) plays a washed-up shakespearean actor lacking in some basic people skills . 

when he's not reliving his glory days in his ramshackle nob hill apartment , screaming scotch-induced "" hamlet "" soliloquies well into the night , he's out and about on the streets of san francisco stalking loose women . 

fahey's dobie sizes up his victims ( actually just one , a peep show performer name of sylvie ) dressed like one of the guys from kraftwerk , and approaches them in the ridiculous attire of a bavarian count replete with a cane , dark glasses , and a false beard ( just in time for halloween ! ) . 

 "" do you have a castle ? "" 

sylvie asks dobie seductively when he flashes the bulging contents of his wallet outside a coffee shop . 

 "" jah . 

with ze many turrets "" is dobie's perplexing reply . 

the real "" star "" of the film ( and i use that term extremely loosely ) is katie wright , who plays the sculptress of the title . 

sarah is new in town , studying at the prestigious sf art institute under the mentorship of a "" genius "" frenchman , played by the beret-wearing patrick bauchau . 

that's convenient , because sarah would one day like to live and work in paris ( you won't believe the film's final shot , with its cheesy eiffel tower backdrop and "" rosemary's baby "" -inspired imagery ) . 

bauchau's character criticizes sarah's work publicly ( her clay busts keep turning into gargoyles--perhaps she's possessed . . . 

by an incubus ! ! ? ) but he still manages to talk her into dinner . 

whereas wright does a decent english accent , her talents pretty much end there . 

on the other side of the wall , dobie's troubled past is succinctly summarized in a scene in which he thumbs through an old scrapbook of newspaper clippings with headings like "" actor delivers a stunning macbeth , "" actor courted by hollywood studio , "" "" actor renounces hollywood for priesthood , "" and "" prostitute fingers priest in sex scandal . "" 

the film's plot could have been just as easily condensed . 

 "" artist moves in next door to shakespearean psychopath . "" 

 "" yawns ensue . "" 

so dobie rants and raves and sarah chips away at large blocks of granite till way past their bedtimes . 

late in the film , their paths finally cross with mind-numbing results . 

nobody else in the apartment complex appears to mind all the racket , but one old dear does go ballistic when sarah's bathtub overflows . 

no , we don't see wright in the tub ( or fahey for that matter ) , and the gore quotient is virtually nil , so for a horror film "" the sculptress "" is surprisingly lacking . 

the only thing worth looking at is san francisco , and writer/director ian merrick manages to make even it look dreary , windswept , and deserted . 

 "" the sculptress "" isn't even bad enough to be fun . 

luckily , a limited release has made it easy to avoid . 
"
"in some respects , rush hour is the ultimate exercise in cliched filmmaking . 

the hero is the renegade cop that prefers to work alone . 

the cop in question cannot solve the case until he gets in trouble . 

all chinese people are somehow involved in the criminal element . 

the duo must always be completely mismatched . 

the hero has to say some smart-assed comment before ( and after ) shooting someone . 

however , that doesn't necessarily make for a bad film . 

rush hour is jackie chan's first major hollywood film since the dismal the protector ( 1985 ) . 

proving once again that hollywood can learn many things from foreign film markets ( ie : hong kong ) , jackie chan is given much more free reign than before . 

still , some die-hard jackie chan fans may be disappointed , as even chan himself has voiced displeasure over the length of the fight scenes ( which he views as too short , according to one interview ) . 

this film takes a familiar theme of east meets west . 

jackie chan is lee , the straight laced inspector who is imported to help deal with a kidnapping case , while chris tucker is carter , the loudmouthed , destructive cop that is `promoted' to the fbi to help him . 

or , at least , so he thinks ( also another classic notion in action films : the fbi must always get in the way of our heroes ) . 

despite the necessary conventions of action films , rush hour is some of the most fun you'll spend and hour and forty minutes watching . 

jackie chan continues to be one of the most exciting martial artists on the big screen , continuing to perform his own stunts and dazzling audiences with his flashy kicks and punches . 

chris tucker , familiar from his whiny , annoying role in the fifth element is more palatable , complementing jackie chan's straight-laced character . 

however , jackie chan still maintains his comic-slapstick edge , as expected of him and his films . 

perfectly downplaying the `fish-out-of-water' routine through his character's attempts at mixing into american culture , he makes up for the down time his character experiences . 

when he is in action , however , you'll be amused and dazzled . 

still being inventive in the use of objects to beat people up ( in this case , a steering wheel , a serving tray , and a barstool ) , jackie chan proves to be the pioneer of slapstick kung fu . 

chris tucker's character may come across as irritating , yet is also humorous . 

since he's not a physical actor to the level of jackie chan , he uses his main weapon : his mouth ( hence , the tagline , `fastest hands in the east meets the fastest mouth in the west' ) . 

while dialogue is not necessarily shakespeare , it is appropriate for the film and still very funny . 

while not necessarily poignant , attempts at character development and growth between characters come off surprisingly well . 

lee's `knowledge' of american pop culture ( `that's the beach boys ! ' ) 

when contrasted against carter's lack of knowledge of chinese culture makes for an interesting scene where lee teaches carter the kung fu disarming trick , while carter teaches lee hip-hop dance moves . 

while rush hour is not at the same level as police story 3 and 4 ( known in north america as supercop and jackie chan's first strike , respectively ) , it more than makes up for the poorly received films operation condor and mr . nice guy . 

with its appropriate mixture of high kicks and lots of laughs , it makes for a fun film . 

as well , it is a true departure from jackie chan films , as it is missing one common element : a whiny female co-star . 
"
"there are those of us who think of leslie nielsen as the bumbling , hapless straight man from the hysterical "" naked gun "" films , crack an immediate smile and forgive him of whatever wavering movie spoof he's committed himself to starring in since . 

the wavering movie spoofs , however , are less forgivable . 

to be fair , "" wrongfully accused , "" the send-up in question and nielsen's third parody since the last "" gun , "" isn't quite as excruciatingly humorless as his "" dracula : dead and loving it "" or "" spy hard , "" which is a mighty good thing . 

nielsen is still in tip-top comedic form , able as ever to deadpan his way through even the most horrible puns , but he really needs a screenplay that plays off his talents instead of relying on them , and he needs one very soon . 

 "" wrongfully accused "" meshes together the premises of "" the fugitive "" and "" patriot games , "" casting its always game star as ryan harrison ( get it ? ) , a master violinist who is drawn into an affair with a married temptress ( kelly le brock ) . 

she , however , sets harrison up to take the rap for the murder of her husband ( michael york ) - a crime actually committed by a one-armed , one-legged , one-eyed man ( aaron pearl ) . 

harrison is arrested , found guilty and sentenced to death , but escapes from a prison bus , of course , and then is pursued by a determined u . s . marshal named fergus falls ( richard crenna , unnecessarily riffing off of tommy lee jones' already smirky oscar-winning role ) . 

there's also a mystery brunette ( melinda mcgraw ) and an assassination subplot involving the u . n . secretary general , but like any of it matters . 

 "" wrongfully accused "" gets off to an assured start , with an in-concert nielsen , touted "" lord of the violin "" by bare-chested posters , pulling a jimi hendrix on his musical instrument as hundreds of tuxedo-clad mosh in front of the stage . 

nice touch . 

most of the scenes that follow , however , never top the opener . 

 ( hysterical exceptions : the mentos and "" baywatch "" goofs . ) 

movie parodies are crammed in at an almost-subliminal rate , but most are empty . 

when a giant snake lunges onto the screen and snatches a cast member a la "" anaconda "" or baseball players disappear into a "" field of dreams "" -esque cornfield , there's really nothing to laugh at . 

other moments , like an interlude in a fishing shop , are so unfocused that you're not sure what you're supposed to be laughing at . 

there seem to be more cheap references than frenzied send-ups here , so it's possible that director/writer pat proft , by bombarding the viewer with a careless mixture of the two , guarantees something is sure to stick . 

and what does stick sticks well , particularly the jabs at genre conventions like stylized flashbacks and hard-boiled dialogue , what those "" naked gun "" s ( which proft collaborated on ) did great ; these bits are so on-target that they allow you to remember "" wrongfully accused "" as an almost-halfway-there spoof instead of a lame-brained failure . 

the movie might have been cursed to begin with , opening fast on the heels of "" mafia ! "" , from proft colleague jim abrahams , and "" baseketball , "" from proft colleague david zucker , but it's a strong possibility that nobody is going to be accusing "" wrongfully accused "" of being nielsen's funniest .

"arriving in a barrage of hype , the blair witch project is one of the biggest box office success of the year . 

however , like the golden child , although blair witch has made a lot of money , it's not very good . 

donahue , williams and leonard play themselves as three students who set out to make a documentary about the blair witch myth . 

the film is made up of the camcorder footage they recorded , which means grainy footage and woozy camera angles . 

although events start of normal , they get weird pretty quickly , while the threesome argue more and more as the journey goes on . 

although an interesting premise , the blair witch project amounts to nothing more than a missed opportunity . 

the biggest mistake the film makes is to let three mediocre actors the chance to improvise . 

most of the dialogue is ad-libbed , and still manages to sound like a poor b-movie . 

the 'script' eventually degenerates into shouting matches , with the f-word included a lot to sound like students . 

there are breaks in these arguments where some creepy events occur , but then it's back to the shouting and swearing , which gets very tiresome very quickly . 

if i wanted to see three people get lost in the woods , shout a lot and swear , i'd go on scout camp . 

but no , the audience is meant to get some entertainment factor out of this , but i'm not quite sure how . 

the supernatural parts of the film are actually interesting , especially if close attention is paid to the story developing first twenty minutes . 

with no music and no budget to work with , the film has to depend on natural , psychological scares , which are sometimes well delivered , sometimes not . 

i never really felt truly scared during any part of the film , although there is a small sense of fear underlying throughout the film . 

however , because the actors are so irritating , the scares are lost when it eventually reverts back to heather saying 'what the f * ck is that ? ' 

a lot , and mike giggling like a loony . 

there's also the niggling fact that these student filmmakers do some really stupid things . 

the main problem is the fact that even though these hapless bunch could be killed at any moment , and are hopelessly lost , heather still insists on filming it all . 

the film gives a half hearted reason why she should want to do this , but it isn't very convincing . 

also , the students have no idea how to survive in the woods , such as following a large river flowing through the woods to civilisation . 

there are also some parts where the 'amateur' camcorder footage is obviously staged , heather's apology being a major one . 

the blair witch project , in the end , just fails to deliver . 

i suppose if you've been lost camping before , the film may deliver some chills , but this is no use for the other 99% of the paying audience who haven't been lost in the woods . 

apart from the final minutes , the film is mind boggingly unscary , and the shouting matches get hideously dull . 

the spook scenes are short and far between , and any other horror movie could probably achieve the same amount of fear that these scenes provide . 

although a good idea , it's not executed well enough to be a fun , scary cinema experience . 

it's a worrying fact when the website ( http : //www . blairwitch . com 

 ) is better than the film . 
"
"adam sandler turns up the charm in his latest romantic comedy , the wedding singer . 

unfortunately , that also has the effect of softening his edge . 

he's nowhere near his peak of happy gilmore , not that it was much of one . 

he's certainly not helped here by a rather frail plot . 

the year is 1985 , letting the whole film obsess with 80s nostalgia . 

adam sandler is nice guy robbie , the titular wedding singer , who entertains at the local reception hall by belting out his interpretations of classic 80s hits . 

robbie's life is thrown into turmoil when his fiancee , linda ( angela featherstone ) , leaves him at the altar . 

however , things are looking up when he meets julia ( drew barrymore ) , a waitress at the hall . 

she's the perfect woman , but for one small flaw : she's engaged to be married to a slick junk bond king , glenn ( matthew glave ) . 

so , most of the film deals with the slow realization by robbie that he and julia are in love , and his attempts to stop the wedding . 

as far as plots go , it's a pretty thin and tired one . 

to fill the gaps , the wedding singer delivers heaping spoonfuls of 1980s nostalgia . 

from boy george to michael jackson , from miami vice to dallas , from the first cds to the last rubik's cubes , this film revels in all the minutiae . 

and then there's the music . . . 

learning a lesson from the successful soundtracks to grosse pointe blank , and romy and michele's high school reunion , this film packs more 80s songs in the film than the running time will allow . 

as a result , most songs get maybe a lyric or a half , but you can almost see the bright gleam in the record executives' eyes : the wedding singer vols . 

2 , 3 , and 4 ! 

while the nonstop 80s riffs get incredibly tiring , at least they distract you from the plot . 

at least last year's my best friend's wedding stirred up the standard "" keep your true love from marrying someone else "" plot by making the rival a nice person . 

here , glenn is such a lowly rat of a man that you never see what julia saw in him . 

barrymore , on the other hand , is simply charming as julia . 

which leaves us with adam sandler . 

he's at his best in the film when his nice guy persona fades a little ( such as when he has a breakdown on stage during a wedding reception ) . 

when he's in full nice-guy mode , he's more pathetic than endearing . 

the film boasts several cameos ( most notably by steve buscemi and jon lovitz ) . 

but none of them work well at all . 

buscemi's role as a drunken best man simply fails to be humorous . 

lovitz , on the other hand , as a rival wedding singer , makes you long for his good old days on saturday night live , where he was actually funny . 

the only cameo which has some appeal is a guest appearance by a classic 80s rocker during the film's finale ( surprisingly , one of the only plot-related scenes which actually works . ) 

adam sandler still has some work to do before he can become a dependable leading man . 

while he attempts to change his image in the wedding singer , the end result is no net gain .

"die hard 2 is an altogether unfortunate fiasco , inferior to the original in every respect . 

place the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson , who wrote the film's pathetic screenplay . 

every line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor . 

the plot is altogether implausible ; the convoluted story line involves a band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower , leaving a dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to land . 

the film has zero credibility , and all of the characters come off as cliched , cardboard cut-outs . 

so much for the script . 

how about the action ? 

well , let's put it this way : director renny harlin could learn a few things from john mctiernan , who directed the original , as well as the hunt for red october and predator--all standouts for their hair-raising suspense . 

by contrast , harlin doesn't have a clue when it comes to choreographing action , and consequently , die hard 2 never picks up steam . 

die harder is impossible to take seriously even for a minute . 

in fact , the movie often seems deliberately campy , and it almost reaches the threshold of being so bad it's good . 

you do laugh , but you laugh at the film , not with it . 

die hard 2 should have never been cleared for takeoff . 
"
"you've got to think twice before you go see a movie with a title like maximum risk . 

the title is generic . 

it's meaningless . 

and i can't believe it's good business . 

when you pick up the phone and dial 777-film , how in the world are you supposed to remember that the new jean-claude van damme movie , the one that looked kind of cool in the trailers and is directed by some chinese hot shot , is called , geez , maximum risk ? 

yuck . 

the movie itself deserves your attention . 

for sweet bloody thrills , this one beats the summer blockbuster competition hands-down . 

only mission : impossible came close to delivering as skillful a thriller , and i'll give maximum risk the edge simply because it's not as slick as the tom cruise picture , and therefore more gratifying in its execution . 

much to my surprise , van damme continues to develop as a pleasant , unpretentious action hero . 

his track record isn't as solid as schwarzenegger's , but he's a hell of a lot more adventurous than arnold . 

in 1993 , van damme worked with hong kong's premier hardcore action director , john woo , on a fairly lame movie called hard target . 

 ( if you can find a bootleg copy , woo's radically different director's cut is much better than what was eventually released . ) 

this follow-up is directed by ringo lam ( city on fire , full contact ) , whose hong kong films are distinguished action pictures that have consistently played second fiddle to woo's more operatic offerings . 

the surprise here is that maximum risk is a more effective hollywood action flick than either hard target or woo's subsequent broken arrow . 

here's the rundown . 

van damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend ( jean-hugues anglade ) finds a corpse that's alain's exact double . 

turns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother , michael , who has been killed by some russian heavies ( and some strangely american looking cops ) . 

alain does some investigating . 

he finds that michael had booked a flight to new york city , and received a message from someone there named alex bohemia . 

assuming michael's identity , alain flies to new york and gets tangled up with michael's girlfriend ( natasha henstridge ) , the fbi , and the russian mob in little odessa . 

that's as much as you need to know . 

the story is adequate , but not overly involving -- and the major plot points are basically explained to you twice , just in case you go out for popcorn at the wrong moment . 

there's a love story , too , but i didn't find it terribly convincing , partly because ex-model henstridge is too high-strung in her high-profile debut ( she had precious few lines as the alien ice queen in species ) . 

she's great to look at , and she can certainly read a line , but what she does here can't really be described as "" acting . "" 

of course , "" acting "" isn't really what she was hired for ( i lost track of whether her shirt comes off more often than van damme's ) . 

the movie is exceptionally violent , bordering on gratuity . 

 ( keep that in mind when planning your date . ) 

the stunts are spectacular , and the fact that you can spot van damme's stand-in makes his work no less impressive . 

there's only so much you can do with a car wreck , but this movie makes crisp , effective use of pile-ups in a handful of frenzied destruction derbies . 

and lam has a surprising , innovative sense of exactly where the camera should go to catch any bit of action . 

the main difference between lam and woo , i believe , is that while woo relies on sheer spectacle to gas up his action show pieces , lam has figured out more about using cinematic space and double-barreled points of view to make things run . 

don't get me wrong -- when chow yun-fat soars through space pumping bullets out of two pistols and chewing on a toothpick with glass and confetti littering the air around him in woo's hard-boiled , it's an amazing moment . 

but it's a moment that's hard to reproduce in hollywood . 

 ( for one thing , hollywood doesn't yet have chow yun-fat ! ) 

while woo's hollywood movies look like the work of a talented upstart , maximum risk is a surprisingly confident picture . 

the very first shot of the film is an awkward overhead view of a chase through the streets of a european city , but lam's use of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on . 

the film editing is a particularly savvy complement to lam's shooting style , accentuating rather than amplifying the action . 

the performances could have used some fine tuning ( in particular , there's an annoying , overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should have been toned down or jettisoned completely ) , and the movie doesn't always overcome the limitations of its genre . 

the story is a little mundane , although there are some effective moments involving van damme's unrequited feelings toward the brother he never knew he had . 

but it's not often that hollywood cranks out a truly satisfying action picture , and it's doubly surprising that this one should come with a mere whisper of publicity . 

van damme fans should treat themselves to what may well be the man's best movie , and international action buffs will no doubt savor this flavorful hong kong/hollywood hybrid .

"i don't know what movie the critics saw , but it wasn't this one . 

the popular consensus among newspaper critics was that this movie is unfunny and dreadfully boring . 

in my personal opinion , they couldn't be more wrong . 

if you were expecting airplane ! -like 

laughs and agatha christie-intense mystery , then yes , this movie would be a disappointment . 

however , if you're just looking for an enjoyable movie and a good time , this is one to see . 

honest , it is . 

this story is about a 4th network , wbn , taking to america's airwaves in 1939 . 

penny henderson ( mary stuart masterson ) , the station owner's secretary , must deal with her overbearing boss , an unimpressed sponsor and writers ready to quite on a moment's notice , partly due to the fact that they haven't been paid in weeks . 

among the mayhem , she must also deal with her soon-to-be ex-husband , roger ( brian benben ) who desperately wants her back . 

unfortunately , her problems only get worse as the night goes on and the body count rises without explanation . 

while trying to woo penny back , roger must deal with the police and try to find the killer that lurks at wbn . 

mary stuart masterson does well in her role as penny ( i'm trying to be unbiased so i won't tell you how amazing she looked ) , although brian benben gets most of the screen time . 

along with the two leads , are several recognizable faces , including corbin bernsen ( l . a . 

law ) , michael mckean ( laverne & shirley ) and bobcat goldthwait . 

the special effects are amazing , and fooled me ( which some may argue isn't very difficult to do ) in many scenes . 

although the movie sometimes goes overboard with the physical comedy , it more than makes up for those mistakes throughout the movie . 

overall , i gave it , or an , depending on what system you use . 

some comments collected from friends : 
"
"one of the last entries in the long-running carry on series , carry on behind is very similar to carry on camping in that it involves a group of holidaymakers descending on a 'caravan' site . 

professors anna vrooshka ( elke sommer ) and roland crump ( kenneth williams ) and a group of archaeology students stay in the caravan site owned by major leep ( kenneth connor ) so that they can explore the nearby roman settlement remains . 

anna has a little trouble understanding english and sometimes people get the wrong end of the stick : - for instance , when anna is asking for 'scrubbers for dirty caravan' , she means that she wants a scrubbing brush to clean the caravan ! 

arthur upmore ( bernard bresslaw ) and his wife linda ( patsy rowlands ) take her mother daphne barnes ( joan sims ) and her minah bird on holiday with them . 

mother-in-law jokes prevail . 

furthermore , the trouble that joe and norma baxter ( ian lavender and adrienne posta ) have with their large irish greyhound allows for some comical moments between the two families . 

fred ramsden ( windsor davies ) and ernie bragg ( jack douglas ) leave their wives ( liz fraser and patricia franklin ) behind for a fishing holiday . 

however , they have more in mind than fishing when they catch sight of two young girls , sandra ( carol hawkins ) and carol ( sherrie hewson ) . 

the story involves the disruption caused by the archaeological professors of the day-to-day running of the camp , the search for the minah bid and greyhound , the major , fred and ernie's desperate need of a woman , a misunderstanding leading to a striptease at the caravan park's pub , and a shock in store for daphne . 

the partnership between sommer and williams is very effective and amusing . 

this is what binds the movie together . 

joan sims stands out as the demanding mother-in-law , bernard bresslaw and patsy rowlands work well together as husband and wife , and carol hawkins and sherrie hewson are a welcome addition to the cast . 

on the other hand , there are low-key performances from kenneth connor and peter butterworth as barnes the handyman , and there are very poor performances by windsor davies and jack douglas who spend far too much time on the screen ! 

even though there is no real plot to speak of and the jokes are getting bluer due to the new scriptwriter dave freeman , there are enough truly comical moments and bright and breezy performances to lift this carry on above many of its predecessors . 

although the regular cast is depleted , the ones that remain show that they can still make a good carry on film . 

a relative flop at the cinema , this movie deserves a lot more recognition . 
"
"when the haunting arrived in theaters , all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects . 

while i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department , i don't think that they are completely to blame for this movie's failure . 

it appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the "" unseen "" terrors , and it was about as scary as a dust bunny . 

so special effects or not , if the story isn't the least bit scary , you aren't going to end up with a very frightening movie . 

the thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern . 

dern is always great , and even though he may have had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie . 

as i sat through the seemingly endless , albeit fairly impressive , special effects , i kept wishing that this movie was about dern's caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast . 

never a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie . 

liam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear . 

he decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals to spend a few days in a haunted mansion . 

he tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia . 

and he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goings-on . 

catherine zeta-jones , lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects . 

like the original , taylor's character is the star of the movie . 

but since she doesn't quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms . zeta-jones , their parts did seem to be a big larger than in the original . 

and let's face it , probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zeta-jones . 

i'll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren't in it . 

but the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets . 

they take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients . 

there really isn't much of a story here . 

just endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with . 

and the special effects are great . 

in many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere . 

in other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the "" cool shots "" quota . 

at no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary -- funny , maybe . 

but not scary . 

then we have the set . 

when i first saw the house , i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it . 

but it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did , and decided to take the idiotically overdone route . 

this included a flooded hallway with books as stepping stones and a mirrored circular room that revolves . 

what part did these rooms play in the story ? 

absolutely none . 

they were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie . 

then we have the actors . 

lili taylor has never been one of my favorites . 

and when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in , she comes in around the average or slightly below mark . 

i have no idea why liam neeson took this role . 

he basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus . 

his character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him . 

i have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman . 

zeta-jones was cast because she is too hot for words . 

the fact that her character is bi-sexual is just icing on the cake . 

all catherine has to do in this movie is look good . 

fortunately that is something she does very well . 

while she does have a fairly good size part , it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie was as eye-candy . 

it's too bad someone of her talents wasted them here . 

any random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role . 

the haunting is the antithesis of another of 1999's horror movies , the blair witch project . 

the haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget , while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares . 

both prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant to a horror film . 

if the story sucks , it's all downhill from there . 

my advice ? 

if you are looking for special effects , go rent star wars . 

if it's scares you want , rent halloween . 

either way , it's probably in your best interests to skip the haunting .

"insane ( but inspired ) musical about alferd packer , the first man ever tried for cannibalism in america . 

as the story unfolds we learn what events led to packer ( trey parker ) supposedly killing and eating the five men who got lost while accompanying him through the mountains of colorado in search of gold . 

throughout , packer must contend with evil trappers bent on stealing his prized horse , a tribe of `ute' indians that doesn't seem quite on the mark , and a terrible winter storm that leads to the eventual cannibalism . 

parker obviously knows his musicals very well , because the viewer is also treated to some of the most maddeningly catchy songs to appear in a film ( he would accomplish this again in his post-cannibal ! 

musical motion picture , south park : bigger , longer , and uncut ) . 

apart from the inherent interest of seeing a pre- "" south park "" parker and stone in their first effort , cannibal ! 

also offers up some pretty decent laughs . 

the aforementioned `ute' indian tribe that packer's group encounters is a definite highlight , as are two rousing musical numbers about snowmen ( one of which ends on a comedically deadly note ) . 

stone's humphrey character steals the show , especially when complaining about the prospect of having to `eat butt' or revealing what's underneath his muff cap . 

jason mchugh's character of mr . miller is the stand out performance though , as he offers a hilarious dissenting voice to the proceedings . 

as i mentioned before , parker's songs are very catchy . 

you'll be hard pressed to get `it's a shpadoinkle day' out of your head once you've heard it ( incidentally , the braniff logo that appears at the end of every "" south park "" episode is scored with a few notes from this song ) . 

other songs you'll find yourself humming include `when i was on top of you' ( a love ballad ) , `the trapper's song' ( the villains leit motif ) , and `hang the bastard' ( the rousing finale ) . 

thankfully , none of these songs are quite as embarrassing to find yourself singing in public as south park : bigger , longer & uncut's songs are . 

released as a pick-up through troma studios , the film is available on videocassette and dvd . 

the videocassette includes an intro by the beautiful jane jensen and an interview segment with lloyd kaufman , discussing his admiration for parker and stone and the fact that they had been hired for a zucker brothers film ( which turned out to be the hilarious baseketball ) . 

there are also multiple trailers for upcoming troma films . 

as for the dvd . . . 

well , that's a different story . 

probably one of the best dvd packages of the year ( and potentially of all time ) , cannibal ! 

the musical ! 

the dvd is a massive achievement . 

presented in 1 . 33 : 1 ( full frame ) only , the disc has the usual troma inclusions : the tour of troma , the troma intelligence test 2 , trailers for upcoming releases , but where the disc truly shines is in its cannibal ! 

specific extras . 

the first thing i must note is , the transfer is about as beautiful as any i've ever seen on any disc . 

the picture is crisp , clear , and free from any noticeable artifacts . 

add to that one of the funniest commentary tracks i have ever heard , featuring trey parker , matt stone , jason mchugh , dian bachar , and andy kemler getting drunker and drunker as the track continues and you still haven't scratched the surface of the extras . 

there's also behind the scenes footage of the shooting of the film , a clip with trey , matt , and lemmy ( of the band motorhead ) from the film terror firmer , an index for easy location of all of the songs in the film , and finally , an index of all the songs as performed by the cast of a stage production of cannibal ! . 

it's good to see this film finally get the treatment it deserves . 

kudos to the entire production staff at troma and aix for making one of the most entertaining dvds i have seen in a very long time .

"capsule : gal is a 50s-ish london cockney gangster who has retired to spain . 

his old associates want him for one last job and send the vicious don to give him an offer he can't refuse . 

a standout performance by ben kingsley as don cannot save what is essentially a set of cliches recycled from old westerns . 

 , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) 

roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast , "" who would have guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by . . . 

ben kingsley ? "" 

my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it . 

they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles . 

the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious . 

that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast . 

gary "" gal "" dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain . 

life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing . 

but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch . 

the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa . 

the second punch comes from gal's past . 

back in london gang boss teddy bass ( ian mcshane , tv's lovejoy ) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal . 

he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal . 

don will accept any decision gal makes from "" yes "" to "" certainly . "" 

however , if gal says "" no "" don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy's ex-porn- star wife deedee ( amanda redman ) . 

in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody's skin . 

kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness . 

there are some serious problems in louis mellis's and david scinto's script that should have been caught before filming . 

when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success . 

beyond an ability to use skin-diving gear , no special talents are required of him . 

any local hood could have done what gal is needed for . 

additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault . 

no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool . 

in spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar . 

i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade . 

the story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability . 

the old gang , however , wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git ? im . 

it is not a great plot . 

in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards . 

perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film . 

it is an old plot dressed up to look new . 

if the plot is old , at least the style is creative . 

this is director jonathan glazer's first film , but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout . 

his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences . 

cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes . 

we see one side of a person's faces . 

but the other side fades into the darkness , a sort of metaphor for the half-world these characters in-habit . 

half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden . 

we yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog . 

at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking , the heavy accents , and the cockney language . 

sexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre , the london crime film . 

the plot may be new to british crime films , but it would be overly familiar as a western . 

further respectability comes from ben kingsley's high-powered performance . 

i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .

"recently one night a young director named baz luhrmann couldn't sleep . 

he tumbled out of bed and moved over to the television where he watched mtv for an hour . 

then he moved to his kitchen where he spent the same amount of time eating spoiled food . 

then he took down a volume of shakespeare's work and read it cover to cover - never really paying attention to the words or plot . 

and then , as a climax , he took out his video camera and pressed the "" on "" button . 

the result ? 

william shakespeare's romeo + juliet - the worst film ever made and a complete failure . 

though , to be fair , an interesting complete failure . 

the idea at the film's core is to make shakespeare appealing to the crowds . 

this is done by moving the camera around at a rapid rate so that we can't see what is going on . 

and filming the dialogue in voice over . 

and shooting leonardo dicaprio like a calvin klein model . 

and making the frame go still while flashing the character's name at the bottom . 

and filming long tedious action sequences in slow motion . 

i mean , man , this is the 90s , dude . 

however i've seen terrible films that are fun to watch . 

 ( examples are batman and robin and the island of doctor moreau . 

 ) that rule doesn't apply here . 

this is a film that takes itself seriously . 

that is it's major fault . 

another problem was pointed out by my friend , alex ( who was singing songs by leonard bernstein throughout . 

 ) ; the original play is a powerful piece of work because the author remained neutral and didn't take sides . 

here it's clear that we are supposed to side with romeo . 

 ( just look at the way they film him . 

 ) from the begining he's our hero and this doesn't work . 

and dicaprio's awful performance doesn't help . 

luhrmann never decides if he wants to entertain us or enlighten us . 

the result is a mess . 

you can feel him striving to be something he isn't . 

he tries to pull of a mix in which drag queens are filmed from purposefully arty angles . 

he tries very hard . 

key word : tries . 

 "" oh look , he's filming above water action from below . 

pretty . 

what does it represent ? "" 

why do people do ugly things ? 

i scrambled away from my tv set feeling guilty as if i could never read the play again and keep a straight face . 
"
" "" he's back , and it's about time . "" 

was the motto for this television series pilot ( i call it a pilot , i don't care what fox network says ) revival of the cult classic british tv show , doctor who , that spawned no series , which means there are no smart network execs out there ( not exactly news to a lot of people , i know ) . 

the motto was well chosen . 

the series was simple , it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled around in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies , including the evil daleks , and the master , who appears in this feature , played very badly by eric roberts . 

as good as this revival was , there is something missing from it to make sure it was really doctor who . 

is it the acting ? 

hell , no ! 

paul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys who've played the doctor ( including his predecessor and off-screen friend sylvester mccoy , who appears once more for the regeneration scene ) . 

he looks right for the role , is a brilliant actor , and slips effortlessly into the role , the way my two favorites jon pertwee and tom baker would . 

daphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr . grace holloway , the doctor's first companion that he kisses on screen , she is not your typical female companion who screams , and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor , she is a tough , spunky american , and ashbrook shows this well . 

young yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee , and i've seen him in other stuff in which he usually plays the punk kid who dies at the end ( this film included ) , which , imho , wastes his talent . 

the only problem with the acting is eric roberts . 

one time he had to say to mcgann's doctor , "" i always dress for the occasion . "" 

but he broke it up , and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like a song lyric , "" i always . . . 

dress . . . 

for the occasion . "" 

you need an actor less slow and less reliant on moving his hands to act , and who's also british , like mcgann is as the doctor . 

executive producer phil segal said he was casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role . 

i dunno who thought of casting him , but if they're reading this : news flash : eric roberts is * not * a star ! 

he rides on his sister's coattails , and any hit movie he makes has nothing to do with him . 

is this problem the kisses to the past ? 

they have references to the show so subtle that non fans would not notice them , only whovians would , and they're good . 

is it the script or the movie as a whole ? 

the script is a classy piece of work , featuring a master who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue , and the movie as a whole is one fans will love , and it is a good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series . 

so what is it ? 

simple : no plot . 

the master , on his last legs , sends for the doctor to rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him . 

the doctor attempts to take his remains back to gallifrey , but they accidentally land in san francisco , 1999 , december 31 , where the master , with young street hood chang lee's help , opens the eye of harmony , which will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor , with the help of female surgeon , dr . grace holloway , doesn't close it by then . 

virtually no plot . 

i was told the movie would've featured the daleks on screen and started with more of a courtroom drama between the master and the daleks , but a lot of rewriting went on on the set . 

that shows how smart people are , as it would have made the movie a hell of a lot more interesting , and that would've gotten a four star rating out of me .

"plot : a young recruit gets plucked out of nowhere by the number one gangster in london and quickly becomes a staple by his side . 

but this new guy is not like all the others , he's got ambition , he's got goals and he loves everything he sees about being the number one gangster . 

violence , lots of swearing and betrayals ensue . 

critique : a very good , serious-minded , unique british gangster flick which misses the "" great "" mark by way of an annoying voice-over popping up throughout the film and a so-so ending . 

here's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix . 

okay , so it's not entirely new , but it's definitely original when all put together as done here . 

the thing i liked most about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period in which it was taking place . 

it's 1968 and these dudes are looking good ! 

yes , it's all about the suits , fellas . . . the 

italian shoes , the cufflinks , the ties and the birds ( that's ladies , for those uninitiated ) hanging around you . 

here are a bunch of horrible men , gangsters if you will , looking sharp , talking shit and busting heads all over the place . 

but that's not the basis of this movie . 

the basis of this film comes in the relationship between the number one gangster in the group , the excellent david thewlis , and one of his cronies , paul bettany , also extremely good in this film , and how the power , sex appeal and coolness of one , affects the other . 

you know how there are always these "" hanger-on "" gangster types who latch on to the godfathers , the leaders , the top dogs of every crime organization ? 

well , most of the time , these dudes are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one person . . . that 

is , their boss . 

so all the gangster number one needs to worry about is his enemies on the other side of the fence . 

but this film brings the betrayals , the messed up loyalties , the honor codes among bad guys into play within the same group and presents it in quite the stylistic package . 

of course , director paul mcguigan isn't trying to be guy ritchie here , and doesn't over-stylize his presentation , jazz it all up with a hip soundtrack or add any humor to the mix . 

nope , he goes straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scenes which are still embedded in my mind as i type this . 

the first is a confrontation sequence between bettany and a man from which he's attempting to sway some information and it is downright nasty ! 

 ( "" look into my eyes ! "" ) 

in fact , the last time that i've seen a guy so scared in a movie was john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brothers' miller's crossing . 

scary shite . 

but there's an ever better scene than that in this film . 

this one features bettany , once again , slowly torturing , hacking and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster ( from that man's point-of-view ) , but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes , one by one ( that's right , he "" does "" the guy in his underwear ) . 

that scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film , especially in the relationship between bettany and his boss ( why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman ? ) . 

but the flick's not perfect . 

in fact , i didn't mind malcolm mcdowell's voice-over narration at first , but as the film grew into a major flashback ( most of the film is presented as such ) , he came in every now and then , and rarely added anything of interest to the plot . 

all he seemed to do was swear and call people the c-word umpteen times , and even described one scene as it was happening ( "" . . . so 

i opened the door , then went up the lift , etc . . . . "" -it's 

like , yeah , i know that already , i could see it on the screen ! ! 

overdone . ) . 

i also didn't quite "" buy "" the ending of the movie , which despite being original , seemed a little unbelievable , especially when you consider that it's supposed to be taking place 30 years later , and folks still seem to be holding grudges , still in love , still living in the same apartments ? ? ! ? 

i mean , c'mon . . . it's 30 years , man ! ! 

i don't know , somehow it didn't work all that well for me . 

but one of my favorite genres has always been the crime movies , and this one is a decent addition to the lot . 

forget the lame title and malcolm mcdowell's narration of the obvious plot points , and concentrate on the film's stronger attributes such as its style , the exquisite atmosphere of the time period , its original look at the gangster dynamic within the same group , its memorable sequences and the solid performances from its two main leads , bettany and thewlis . 

incidentally , unlike a few of the gangster flicks that i mention below , this one is in no way a parody or homage to this genre of films . . . it's the real deal ! 

note : this film is packed with strong accents all around , which makes it hard to make out some of the words from time to time . 

it's also quite violent and i don't remember any film that used the c-word as much as this one , so leave the kids at home for this one . . .

"there is a scene early in jakob the liar that hints at how much better it could have been . 

the scene is set in a jewish ghetto in poland circa 1944 , where a one-time cafe proprietor named jakob heym is walking resolutely through the streets , fists stuffed into coat pockets . 

to one side of him , residents scavenge for food in the street ; to the other side , german troops beat a group of jews . 

jakob , however , never stops moving . 

it's an efficient , effective set-up for the character , who is clearly nobody's idea of a hero at the outset . 

he is a man who has responded to the horror of his surroundings by withdrawing from them , excising his moral peripheral vision . 

the set-up is critical because fate will turn jakob into a reluctant savior . 

after a visit to a german commandant's office and a moment alone with a turned-on radio , jakob learns that russian troops are quite near . 

when he brings this first news of the war in years to his fellow jews , they become convinced that he must have a radio , which is a punishable offense in the ghetto . 

the good news brings hope to the ghetto ; the everyday specter of suicide vanishes . 

a private man of limited creativity finds himself burdened with creating stories of russian military progress just to keep his neighbors alive . 

this promising story of an ordinary person doing the extraordinary is burdened from the outset by casting : the "" ordinary person "" in question , jakob heym , is played by robin williams . 

i am of the depressing opinion that williams is growing less assured as an actor in his "" serious "" roles with every passing year . 

compare his dramatic scenes in the world according to garp and moscow on the hudson with what dreams may come or patch adams , and see how much more mannered he has become ( or , at the very least , how much less sensible at choosing material ) . 

jakob the liar depends on the notion that jakob has to struggle to craft his fictions , but williams always looks like he's struggling _not_ to craft them . 

when he improvises a radio address by winston churchill for ailing 10-year-old orphan lina ( hannah taylor gordon ) , he seems relieved that he can finally get wacky . 

oh yes , and then there's that little girl . 

some viewers will undoubtedly consider the hero's fanciful stories for a young charge too reminiscent of life is beautiful , but those scenes aren't problematic because they're familiar . 

they're problematic because they're jarring and distracting , introducing a cutesy relationship into a film that shouldn't have been about cutesy relationships . 

jakob's character arc may be about his willingness to act for the benefit of others , but there are plenty of others without poor little lina . 

every scene with her feels contrived , pulling jakob the liar away from its central story of hope coming to a previously hopeless people . 

it is a pleasant surprise to find that jakob the liar is a much grittier production than you might expect from a hollywood-ized holocaust , combining the weighty subject matter with dark humor in some effective ways . 

director peter kassovitz , working from jurek becker's novel , crafts some nice scenes between jakob and the other townspeople , and draws solid performances from armin mueller-stahl ( as a once-revered doctor ) and bob balaban ( as a barber drifting into depression ) . 

there are just too many things going on that prove distracting , whether it's the sketchy romanctic angle involving liev schreiber as an earnest former prizefighter , or williams' incongrous presence , or a sweet but utterly irrelevant little girl . 

jakob the liar deals with too delicate a subject for such fumbling , and has too compelling a central character to waste . 

and after one wonderful early scene , you can see the film wasted and fumbled away . 
"
"contact is the 1997 movie i've seen the most - five times to be exact . 

four of those times were on the big screen , but even on a tv , it's a very impressive film . 

the same can't be said for films like independance day , but that's because contact is a rare example in sci-fi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects , and all of us know looking back that id4 didn't offer much outside of some one-time delightful eye candy . 

contact's wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) , a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of "" merely listening "" to sounds out in space . 

her interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age , encouraged by her loving father , ted ( david morse ) , who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola , fl ( that was , of course , before the days of internet chat rooms ) . 

while everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence ( of which the program seti is an acronym for ) , ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on , keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive . 

ellie's strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist , a belief likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young . 

in puerto rico , she meets palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a writer examining the effects of technology on the world's overall happiness ; a one- time seminary student who describes himself as "" a man of the cloth , without the cloth "" . 

despite the vast differences in opinion regarding a "" supreme being "" , ellie and palmer hit it off , and even take the time to sleep together . 

it's a weak and hurried relationship , but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on . 

meanwhile , dr . david drumlin ( tom skerritt ) , who has authority over seti but finds the program a frivolous waste of time and money , is ready to pull the plug on any and all seti funding . 

this leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors , eventually finding a setup in new mexico and leaving palmer with no explanation , and only a one night stand to remember . 

it is in this nm city where , several months later , ellie finally picks up on a strong signal from outer space , perhaps the most profound discovery in the history of science . 

when the signal is closely examined , many new developments spring up , and before long , drumlin is stepping in to take over the operation he once scoffed at . 

eventually , it is concluded that information in the signal may be blueprints for a transportation device used to teleport an earthling to vega ( where the signal seems to have originated ) . 

the media swarms , fanatics go further off the deep end , scientists clamor for new information , politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions to take , and presidents are morphed into a celluloid reality ( remember when zemeckis couldn't get enough of this in forrest gump ? ) . 

as if that weren't enough , ellie's discovery leads her to the nation's capital where she again runs into palmer . 

contact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs . religion . 

the impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented , with no signs of bias . 

arguments for both sides are intelligent , solid , and thought-provoking . 

when palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega ( of which ellie is a leading candidate ) , personal convictions play a more important role than love interests . 

the question is , can a person who doesn't believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when 90% of the planet * does * believe in a higher power ? 

even when the film wraps up , it's uncertain whether it's meant to play as an advocate for religion , science , both , or even neither , and in our modern day society where "" right and wrong "" is only opinion ( at least speaking "" politically correctly "" ) , the ambiguity is an incentive . 

don't get me wrong . 

as much as it sounds like it , contact isn't merely a theology class rolled into a reel of film . 

it's a * highly * enjoyable two and a half hours . 

despite its seemingly heavy issues , it's not a tedious undertaking to watch this film . 

the special effects are outstanding , though ( warning ! ) 

highly depreciated on the small screen . 

even so , some of the subtle visual effects ( that will likely go unnoticed by many ) are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as "" sci-fi "" . 

the storytelling is rich and complete , and although there are moments in the film that feel quite pretentious ( and at times , even hokey ) , it's easily one of the best 1997 films , and one of the best sci-fi films i've ever seen . 

this is zemeckis' best since back to the future , and for those of us who actually know that forrest gump was astronomically overrated , zemeckis now has real reason to boast . 
"
"watching the movie , i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup , cute 'n cuddly , computer-generated monkey . 

if the monkey died , the movie got an extra half star . 

alas , the monkey showed up at the end , unharmed , to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs . 

what that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars . 

that's pretty generous , considering the movie's camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek . 

when will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it . 

so why such a seemingly high rating ? 

there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage . 

first , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater . 

the sound and screen kicked ass . 

nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don't necessarily mean that in a good way ) . 

also , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie's tension . 

i even liked the computer-generated settings . 

i usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i've seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities . 

also , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain . 

william hurt isn't too bad either . 

neither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable . 

and perhaps i shouldn't admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood . 

there is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a "" real "" kiss -- no sex ) . 

it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six . 

those movies were probably as bad as lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven . 

that type of moviemaking is a lost art . 

now for the bad news . 

worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue . 

it's squeaky-clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction . 

 "" you better hold on to your joystick , "" is one such line . 

and when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign . 

second worst , and closely related , is the screenplay . 

the story's exposition takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain what's happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest . 

once the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived . 

when gary oldman easily reprograms will's pet robot to kill the robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : "" he flipped the switch to 'evil . ' "" 

then there's the tone of the movie . 

the colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson . 

then it could be an adventure movie . 

they're mostly right , except that johnson ( will ) wasn't a good enough actor to carry it off . 

still , that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination . 

just because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn't mean that we have to bow to a "" promise keepers "" notion of who's the center of a family . 

many quality family films have been made with a non-traditional family structure ( fly away home comes to mind ) to much better effect . 

and the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie . 

in star wars , the rebels were the good guys . 

we were rooting for those who were fighting against the system . 

in lost in space , the rebels are the bad guys , a terrorist force that must be killed , crushed and silenced so that our children may live free . 

that ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists . 

finally , a few specific details deserve criticism . 

the movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056 . 

why ? 

why bother saying what year this is . 

just tell us it's the future . 

i bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 . 

setting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won't be timeless ( not that this movie was really in the running anyway . ) . 

then there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole . 

this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny's barber chair , and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven't learned a thing about ergonomics . 

one vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed : it made lost in space look cool . 

the strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and , out of context , made it sound hip . 

this is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie . 

but if that's the best part of the movie , i can't in good conscience recommend it . 

still , if you get stuck seeing it , as we did , you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance , think of liking bad movies as a child , and bring along your "" bad movie bingo "" cards .

"like the wonderful 1990 drama , "" awakenings , "" starring robin williams and robert de niro , "" at first sight , "" directed by irwin winkler , is inspired by a true story documented by physicfirst sight , "" directed by irwin winkler , is inspired by a true story documented by physician oliver sacks . 

since "" awakenings "" was so very good , and made my top ten list the year it was released , "" at first sight "" is not quite as strong since it is not directed with as sure a hand as penny marshall , but is still an intelligent and vibrantly-acted drama . 

the film begins as amy ( mira sorvino ) , a stressed-out new york architect , decides to take some time off and travel upstate to the country . 

at the hotel she is staying at , she makes a massage appointment and after a long , soothing session which ends with her crying as a release of emotions , she strikes up a conversation with the handsome masseur virgil ( val kilmer ) , only to find out later that he is actually blind . 

amy doesn't really care if he has a handicap or not , and begins to spend time with him more and more until they finally start to fall in love . 

once she has returned to new york , amy begins to research on virgil's certain type of retinal blindness , which he has had since three years of age , and out of a stroke of luck , comes into contact with a doctor ( bruce davison ) who believes he can repair virgil's sight , even though there have only been thirty similar cases in history . 

at first reluctant , virgil finally travels with amy to nyc and agrees to the surgery , much to the hesitance of his overbearing , but loving older sister ( kelly mcgillis ) . 

ultimately , the surgery is a success , but problems arise since virgil cannot relate to what he sees , since he has never visually seen anything before , only touched objects . 

he moves into amy's apartment and she is eager to stand by him , but virgil's maladjustment begins to put a strain on their relationship . 

on the basis of the overall story , "" at first sight "" is indeed a film that has been done many times before , and owes a great deal to its predecessor , "" awakenings . "" 

what will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance . 

however , what helps "" at first sight "" rise above this predictability is in the mature and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy . 

usually , romantic pictures are of the shameless puppy-dog sort ( the recent tom hanks/meg ryan-starrer "" you've got mail "" immediately pops to mind ) , but with this film , i grew to care more about the characters and their plight . 

the film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil . 

the massaging sequences were strangely erotic , maybe even more so than the later actual "" love scenes , "" and as their romantic involvement quickly developed , the film was both entertaining and sweet , and there was clearly a lot of chemistry between the two . 

these joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to a contrast in the life styles that they have always known , with virgil completely used to being blind and having a comforting , peaceful life in the country to amy's eventful life in the "" big city . "" 

the other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board . 

val kilmer , usually cast in the "" macho "" type of role , was always believable as a blind person , and playing his character was probably a little more tricky than it appears . 

it was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity , but to sympathize with , and he pulled it off . 

mira sorvino , who made a spectacular debuting splash in 1995's hilarious woody allen comedy , "" mighty aphrodite , "" for which she won a well-deserved oscar as a kind-hearted , but ditzy hooker , is a standout here . 

although she has made some mediocre film choices since then ( 1997's "" mimic , "" 1998's "" the replacement killers "" ) , she always has managed to come out unscathed , and it is with "" at first sight "" that she finally has another juicy role to play . 

in a truthful climactic scene set in amy's apartment between she and virgil , sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses around today , and has a flare for both comedic and dramatic pieces . 

kelly mcgillis , who could have easily come off as the "" bad , "" one-dimensional sister , instead is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character to play as a woman who may be overly protective but simply cares for her brother . 

finally , nathan lane , who is usually a little too over-the-top , is appropriately restrained as a vision therapist . 

the one misstep of "" at first sight "" is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil . 

very little is ever said or discussed concerning it , and when the surgery occurs , it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eyes . 

perhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more in-depth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences , but i would personally take realism , even if it is graphic , any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder . 

in "" awakenings , "" the patients and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed . 

because of how strong the screenplay , written by steve levitt , is in the way it deals with the main relationship , and because of the fabulous performances from kilmer and sorvino , the film's few problems can be swept over to the side . 

the adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is , no doubt , in respect to the real-life couple that the film was inspired by , who are still together after many years ( even though the setting of the film was changed to new york ) . 

since january is usually the time of year that is known as the dumping ground from bad movies , "" at first sight "" comes as a refreshing and sophisticated change of pace .

"adam sandler vehicles are never anything special , but continue to make a load of money . 

which really goes to show the sad state of cinema today . 

while good comedies like rushmore , to choose a recent example , gets limited release and doesn't make a lot of money , big daddy got a huge release and has made a lot of cash . 

it's also nothing special and doesn't deserve the money it's making . 

but i digress . 

sandler plays sonny koufax , a unemployed new yorker with a seemingly low mental age . 

his girlfriend makes a ultimatum to him : either wise up and get responsible , or she's leaving him . 

by a strange set of events , koufax ends up with julian ( played by twins cole and dylan sprouse ) a five year old kid . 

after a failed attempt to impress his girlfriend with the child , koufax decides he wants to keep the child . 

however , social worker mr brooks ( mostel ) finds out that koufax isn't the real father and wants to take julian back . 

koufax along with his new girlfriend layla ( lauren adams ) fight to keep the child . 

big daddy really isn't that good . 

many of the jokes revolve around toilet humour , and supposedly we are meant to find julian and sonny peeing against a wall to be funny . 

there's the occasional good one liner , but these are usually strangely delivered wrong and lose most of the humour . 

the film , after all these silly gags , then suddenly turns sentimental , and this is where big daddy really goes from bad to hideous . 

the court scene at the end of the film is useless and unbelievable , and not helped by the soppy overacting . 

it's a poor attempt to win over the audience . 

adam sandler basically plays the same role he has in his last few films ( except the wedding singer . ) 

joey lauren adams is much , much better , and deserves a far better film than this trash . 

steve buscemi pops up in a funny cameo , and his scenes are pretty funny . 

rob schneider is also funny as a crazy delivery man . 

the two twins who play julian are o . k , they start out rather well , but then becoming annoying and brattish halfway through and finally turn 'all american' wholesome goodness at the end of the film , where the tear juice is turned up high . 

big daddy is really nothing special , and is not even worth it for a few chuckles . 

although it is actually well put together , with nice direction , good production design and even some montages , this professionalism can't help the fact that the script and characters are trash . 

big daddy is for die hard fans of sandler , and that's about it .

"in a flashback , the teenage girl in the eccentric family in the canadian film , the hanging garden , tells her senile grandmother that she is going to a school dance . 

horrified , the grandmother wants to know if her granddaughter knows "" the rule of 6 . "" 

if you don't break off a kiss by the count of 6 , then you committed a sin with the boy . 

and most of all , the grandmother wants to know if she has "" protection ? "" 

she must carry a rosary in her pocket at all times . 

the richly acted film is written and directed by thom fitzgerald in a quirky but loving style . 

although some may refer to the film as yet another dysfunctional family picture , that moniker misses the mark . 

yes , every member of the household has their own special problems , but the writer didn't choose to name so many characters for various flowers by accident . 

this delightful little picture mixes love , tragedy and pathos , resulting in a hopeful and almost magical concoction . 

during the opening credits we observe the boy , sweet william , at the center of the story . 

first , he's an average sized young lad who is slapped off-screen by his father . 

next , he's 300 pound teenager , played with hopelessness and depression by troy veinotte . 

when the opening credits end , we cut to 10 years later . 

william is now an average-sized , reasonably happy adult , played with love and compassion by chris leavins . 

william has returned after 10 years absence to attend the marriage of his free-spirited and foul-mouthed sister rosemary to his first childhood lover , fletcher ( joe s . keller ) . 

kerry fox from an angel at my table and shallow grave plays rosemary with a compelling joy . 

nicole burnell , who gave such a devastating performance in the sweet hereafter , plays the teenage rosemary . 

the father of the family , whiskey mac ( peter macneill ) , is an alcoholic autocrat who is more obnoxious than harmful . 

his wife , iris ( seana mckenna ) , says that she would have left him years ago to at least go to some place warm were it not for her lack of money and her obligations to the kids . 

rounding out the family is christine dunsworth as nine-year-old violet , the sister whom william meets for the first time . 

as the exuberant irish music fills the air at the wedding in the family home , william wanders off to try on one of his old coats , which causes him to laugh at the size of his former self . 

the director manages to stage simple scenes in wonderfully imaginative ways . 

he takes a common wedding dress train and uses it to set up scenes in fresh and fascinating ways . 

rosmary's trip to the bathroom after drinking too much beer is beautifully orchestrated , and kerry fox is at her hilarious best trying to cope with the long train in a small bath , all while talking to her brother . 

as much as anything , the film is a series of character sketches . 

in one of the strongest we watch william in a flashback as he has his first sexual encounter , a homosexual one . 

although he is perfectly happy liking the same sex , his mother is aghast . 

a woman friend of hers suggests she take william to a local housewife , dusty miller ( martha irving ) , who , for a fee , will have heterosexual sex with william . 

with absolute finesse the director crafts a subtle scene that manages to yield significant emotional punch without being sensational . 

dusty , after asking iris to watch her daughter , takes william and gently introduces him to the joys of sex with the opposite sex . 

all of this notwithstanding , he still prefers males . 

the film is at its most poignant in several sequences in which the grown william comes face-to-face with himself when younger . 

this causes his ugly old memories to be reignited . 

in the most devastating , he has to come to grips with his former self who was so overwhelmed with the stress that he tried to hang himself . 

even here , the director touches your heart without ever letting the story dissolve into anything approaching a tearjerker . 

the ultimate result is an uplifting story that has more hope that one would ever expect from the outline of its plot . 

the hanging garden runs 1 : 31 . 

it is rated r for strong sexuality , language , violence and some teen drug use and would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are quite old and mature .

"films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there's never really been a comic book like from hell before . 

for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . 

to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . 

the book ( or "" graphic novel , "" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . 

in other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source . 

if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell's directors , albert and allen hughes . 

getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ? 

the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london's east end . 

it's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called "" unfortunates "" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision . 

when the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case . 

abberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . 

upon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can't stomach . 

i don't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay . 

in the comic , they don't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end . 

it's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts . 

and from hell's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( "" who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? "" ) . 

don't worry - it'll all make sense when you see it . 

now onto from hell's appearance : it's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) . 

the print i saw wasn't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don't say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic . 

oscar winner martin childs' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place . 

even the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent . 

ians holm ( joe gould's secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham . 

i cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually wasn't half bad . 

the film , however , is all good .

"in , "" the muse "" albert brooks plays steven phillips , a hollywood screenwriter who after winning a humanitarian award for his work is dumped by his studio . 

they claim that he's lost his edge and his agent is quick to agree with them . 

he knows that he needs to write something fresh and original and quick or else his career will be over . 

so he turns to his "" best "" friend , jack ( jeff bridges ) another screenwriter who's enjoyed success after success . 

on the way over to jack's house steven sees jack helping an attractive woman ( sharon stone ) into a cab and begins to think : is he having an affair ? 

when confronted , jack relunctently tells him that this mystery woman is , in fact , a muse , a mythological figure who is believed to have inspired all creativity , and has helped him garner his success . 

 "" she doesn't do any actual writing , "" he is told , "" but inspires you . "" 

steven is excited by what he's hearing and asks jack to call her up to see if she'll take steven on as a new client . 

jack arranges a meeting between the two and suggests that steven bring her a present , preferably something from tiffany's . 

after the meeting the muse , sarah decides to take on steven , but at a price : she wants a suite at the four seasons and wants steven to perform odd tasks for her ( like bringing her salads in the middle of the night . ) 

steven's wife ( andy macdowell ) sees him at a food store and questions him about why he has tampons in his wagon . 

steven confesses everything and , although at first suspicious , she later allows sarah to move into their guest room and eventually into their life . 

the only question for steven is if the muse is worth all the trouble he's going through for her . 

and that's a question only time will tell . 

 "" the muse "" is albert brooks' sixth film as writer/director/actor ( he co-wrote with monica johnson ) and although it's a good movie it's not up to the level of his best works ( "" defending your life "" and "" mother "" ) . 

the problem lies in the script , and for a movie that relies on its dialogue for its humor , there aren't nearly as many laughs as they are chuckles despite a few good one-liners . 

it has a great premise but doesn't deliver up to it's full potential . 

but , i like albert brooks in this film and i think that we can all identify with steven phillips a little bit . 

he may whine and complain , but he just wants to support his family and be happy . 

and i like sharon stone in this movie too ; it's a nice change of pace for her . 

and i also enjoyed the cameos featuring the likes of rob reiner , james cameron and martin scorsese . 

and although "" the muse "" doesn't have as much to say about hollywood as robert altman's "" the player "" i still left the theater feeling good . 

and that's something i wish i got out of more movies .

"a number of critics have decided that it's open season on freddie prize jr . , slamming the young actor as an utterly talentless pretty boy on career cruise control in sound-alike , disposable teen fluff like "" head over heels , "" "" boys and girls , "" "" down to you "" and "" she's all that . "" 

while the prinze oeuvre is hard to defend , his talent is not . 

i first saw him in the independent dark comedy "" the house of yes , "" where he gave a subtle , impressive performance as the younger brother in one of america's freakiest families . 

prinze has the acting chops ; he just needs to take a few supporting roles in some grown-up movies to show the non-believers that he has what it takes . 

 "" summer catch "" certainly won't help his case . 

inoffensive , but utterly generic , the baseball-related romantic comedy does little more than kill time . 

the story deals with the love affair between tenley ( jessica biel ) , a wealthy cape cod girl and ryan ( prinze ) , a local boy from a working class family who dreams of becoming a big-time baseball star . 

ryan's preoccupation with his new honey-bunny drives her elitist father ( bruce davison ) crazy and endangers his position as pitcher with a cape cod summer league team . 

it's a wonder the kid has any time to pitch , as his time is occupied with making out with tenley , fighting with her dad , bonding with his own dad ( fred ward , who deserves better than this ) , fighting with his brother ( jason gedrick ) and carousing at a neighborhood bar with his teammates . 

the filmmakers desperately want to make a quirky , character-heavy baseball movie like "" bull durham , "" but haven't got a clue how to get there . 

and so they glide from one clich ? to the next for 108 minutes . 

the only bit of originality comes from marc blucas in a minor role as a center-fielder from texas . 

in an early barroom scene , blucas , best known as demon-fighting riley finn from "" buffy the vampire slayer , "" hears a young woman compliment a guy on his ass , then turns to teammate matthew lillard and states , "" he does have a nice ass . 

a bubble butt . "" 

when lillard gives him an "" are you insane ? "" 

look , blucas calmly says , "" it's nothing sexual , "" then goes on to evaluate the hind-ends of some other players , including lillard's . 

speaking of asses , prinze does not bare his in the movie . 

the actor has a no nudity clause in his contract , so two stunt-butts were employed for a couple of semi-nude shots . 

blucas , whose character secretly dates a large woman throughout the story , gets another unique moment late in the film . 

sick of hearing teammates make "" fat chick "" jokes , he climbs on top of a table and loudly declares his love of amply-sized ladies . 

while his speech still ends up objectifying women , it remains a nice change of pace in a numbingly ordinary movie . 

trivial tidbit : "" summer catch "" marks a scooby doo summit . 

marc blucas appears in "" jay and silent bob strike back "" as fred from the scooby doo gang , while freddie prinze jr . plays the same character in the upcoming big budget film version of the old cartoon . 
"
"five years after his directorial debut based on stephen king's writings called the shawshank redemption ( 9/10 ) , writer/director frank darabont returns to the big screen with another prison film based on the famous scribblings of stephen king . 

unlike the latter film , this one is a big , long , laborious bore . 

plot : a seven-foot death row inmate is discovered to have secret healing powers . 

critique : this film is slow , drawn-out , boring , uninteresting , unexciting , predictable and topped with a couple of one-dimensional "" evil "" characters . 

its only positive attribute lies in its actors who all do credible jobs and its message of hope and belief in miracles . 

the real miracle of my night was the fact that i did not fall asleep during this straightforward , unimpressive film about a guy with special powers who we never truly understand or care about . 

of course , much like all other death row cell blocks , this one is filled with decent inmates who all happen to be "" misunderstood "" , except for one cookie-cutter crazy guy who is evil personified . 

and let's not forget all the guards on death row , who also happen to be angels from the heaven above , except for one cookie-cutter crazy guard who is also evil personified ( and is there any reason why there are about six guards when there appears to be no more than three inmates ? ? ? ) . 

am i supposed to identify with anyone in this film ? 

or even more importantly , am i supposed to give a rat's ass about anyone in this film ? 

well , if i was , i sure missed that boat , because the only thing that i ended up caring about during this entire picture was the obscene amount of fat that tom hanks has been able to burrow under his loose chin . 

furthermore , there is absolutely no reason in the world why director frank darabont needed to take three hours and ten minutes out of anyone's life to present this story . 

in fact , the story is empty within itself . 

i truly did not get anything out of the film other than the fact that there is a guy on death row who has special powers to heal , and we are left wondering if he should still be executed or not . 

wow . 

how interesting . 

the plot's utter predictability is also at fault here with one guess as to whom is to get healed by the gentle monster in this film ( we are told that one certain lady has a tumor early on in the movie ) . 

whip out those thinking caps , kids ! 

hmmm , and i wonder what will happen to those two cookie-cutter "" evil "" guys who have nothing in their system but hate and negativity . 

hmmmm , now think hard here , boys and girls . 

what a crock ! 

i am guessing that this film was supposed to be some three-hour exercise in spirituality , but unfortunately for me , it was neither spiritual or the least bit engaging . 

in fact , it was one big bore . 

i didn't see the point of the movie , i didn't see the point of the story and i certainly didn't see the point in tom hanks' big double-chin . 

all in all , a bad movie starring some great actors doing solid work , especially michael clarke duncan as the man of the hour , john coffey . 

give that man an award or something !

"capsule : suprisingly more of a comedy than a straight action flick , which isn't necessarily a bad thing . 

not exactly oscar caliber , but one helluva bullet-riddled good time . 

extended review : you know , i remember when hitmen were evil , murderous scum . 

alas , the times are a-changin' . 

in a recent string of movies , hitmen are suddenly wise- cracking , fun-loving killers-with-hearts . 

this brings us to hong kong director kirk wong's first american feature , the big hit . 

oddly enough , about the same time last year a similar film , grosse point blank , was released . 

advertised as a quirky comedy with hints of action , it turned out to have a suprising dosage of it . 

the big hit is quite the opposite . 

it was hyped as "" the new film from producer john woo "" , so one would it expect lots of stylized killing and action . 

however , there's a sore lack of it , which is about the only thing wrong with the big hit . 

the film starts out with mel smiley and his cohorts doing a job on a white slaver . 

mel , played by mark wahlberg in a dopey , milquetoast role , is a killing machine ; he flips , spins , even breakdances whilst popping caps . 

sadly , he doesn't get a chance to do much of it . 

except for the beginning set piece and the last 20 twenty minutes or so , the film is in comedy mode . 

the action , at least what there is of it , is prime cut stuff . 

wong , after numerous hong kong features , makes quite a nice u . s . debut . 

however , his pacing is a bit off , with the action sequences only bookending the movie and not lasting long enough . 

they start off electrifying and fresh , but just kinda stop . 

normally , this would hamper a movie to the point of being unenjoyable . 

luckily , we have ben ramsey's screenplay , a bitingly funny piece of work . 

the only problem is there might be too much humor , one joke makes you laugh so hard you miss the next few . 

some of best gags include an oriental film maker down on his luck and one of mel's hitmen pals that has just discovered onanism . 

the only problem is how some of the minor characters are handled , some being there only for a laugh , which sometimes works , sometimes doesn't . 

overall , the big hit may have it's flaws , but it makes up for them in a stylishly directed , gut-wrenchingly funny joyride . 

definately one of the better ways to spend two hours .

"taking a few tips from the pulp fiction school of filmmaking , go is the new feature from the director of the cult hit swingers . 

the story centres around a group of people , who include brit simon ( askew ) , and checkout girls claire ( holmes ) and ronna ( polley ) and the misadventures that they get into , split into three chapters . 

everything from sex to drugs to violence is covered in a film with a much blacker edge in comedy than swingers . 

although qt's touch is evident in nearly every frame , go is entertaining enough to forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride . 

liman , who also photographed the film , has a deft touch with the camera , and the film looks good . 

the film also seems to have benefited from a budget , with the night-club scenes in particular looking pretty good . 

there's a twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get a smirk . 

the young cast are talented and help bring the story to life . 

holmes , one of the dawson's creek cast ( a show i'm not particularly fond of ) displays much talent here , and despite her largely limited screen time manages to make a three dimensional character and never becomes a caricature . 

askew is slightly successful , being rather obnoxious . 

no doubt the filmmakers intended this to make the audience cheer when what happens to him , but instead of 'funny annoying' he's just annoying . 

he drags down slightly one of the funniest chapters , but the talent around him in that particular tale more than makes up for it . 

the real standout is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl : her refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining . 

also entertaining timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer , who gives an nice evil performance . 

the script , written john august , is sharp and witty , with good dialogue and some funny jokes . 

it starts off rather slow however , but in about twenty minutes the script has found it's footing and just keeps getting better . 

the stories are largely satisfying , although occasionally there's too much attention on one detail but not on another . 

also , some of the endings seem a little forced and lucky . 

still , the cast have a meaty script to get into and obviously enjoy it . 

it could of tried a little harder in some parts however , and these parts lag . 

because this is a gen-xer movie , the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany , and go's one is pretty decent . 

unlike other gen-xers movies , go never allows the music to substitute for plot or dialogue , which is a plus . 

go is a very easy movie to absorb into , and the audience really starts feeling for these characters . 

thankfully , they never become two dimensional characters who are bent and twisted throughout the movie to fit into the stories mechanics ( like the heroine in 10 things i hate about you . ) 

they are who they are and they stay that way . 

go is great fun , and a worthy follow up from the director of swingers . 

ignore the fact that it steals from pulp fiction and very bad things , and just sit back and enjoy the rollercoaster ride . 

erm , go to go , i guess .

"modern audiences are more likely to be familiar with les misirables from the pop-broadway musical rather than victor hugo's original tome . 

adapted several times for the cinema , this latest effort does a superb job of translating the characters , story , and heart of the novel to the screen . 

liam neeson stars as jean valjean . 

as a young man , valjean stole some bread to satisfy his hunger . . . and he was sentenced to 19 years of hard labor for his crimes . 

prison hardened him , and on his release he seems doomed to a life of crime and squalor . 

however , an unexpected act of compassion changes his outlook on life , and he vows to become a better man . 

however , he runs up against one man who doesn't believe in reform . 

inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is an obsessive law abider . 

he has no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules , even with benign intentions . 

he once served as a guard at the labor camp where valjean served , and after valjean breaks his parole , javert devotes himself to bringing him to justice . 

two women also get caught up in the struggle . 

fantine ( uma thurman ) is an unwed mother suffocating in an unforgiving society . 

her daughter , cosette ( mimi newman , and later , claire danes ) , is her life , yet she cannot afford to raise her . 

instead , cosette is sent to live with a cruel foster family which extorts money from fantine , and forces cosette into a life little better than a slave . 

director bille august manages to create a faithful adaptation of victor hugo's novel , which , though omitting some of the political undertones , remains true to the overall story and tone of the book . 

hopefully you won't , as some clueless members of the audience did , wonder where all the songs went . 

the movie manages to be completely engrossing without the andrew lloyd webber flourishes . 

the experience is bolstered by strong performances throughout , though neeson and rush deservedly take center stage with their core roles . 

neeson in particular deserves kudos for his portrayal of a man trying to do good , but continually haunted by his past . 

the supporting cast is also extraordinary . 

the only actor who dims in comparison is hans matheson , playing the revolutionary , marius . 

the film slightly loses its luster during his brief love affair , but it is transitory , and truly only distracting when contrasted with the rest of the film . 

the novel les misirables is , by any account , an epic , both in its scope and in its length . 

while it would be nearly impossible to cram everything from its pages into a two hour movie , this latest attempt does an admirable job at the translation . 

it , too , is an epic . . . and one worth seeing .

"i find most of television so intensely boring that i simply never turn on my set , unless i'm watching a movie . 

i don't even have cable , so i went to radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching "" the x-files "" every sunday night . 

it's the only show that's worth an hour of my time each week ( though , since i don't watch reruns , i'm glad that i have six months of the year to avoid television altogether ) . 

i am an avid fan of the show , and have been for about three years now . 

and i love gillian anderson . 

the x-files is the film that continues the story where the season finale left off . 

the film is like a two-hour episode , except that there are a lot more special effects , the plot is thicker , and the resolution is more satisfying . 

this is a terrific film , both for fans of the series and for those who have never seen it ( i imagine that viewers unfamiliar with the show will find the film to be solid and riveting entertainment ) . 

i expected to like it more than any episode i've seen , and my expectations were met . 

actually , the film takes a few risks in its story and plot devices , but , thankfully , the makers managed to do it right . 

when the finale ended , the fbi branch known as the x-files had been destroyed , and our heroes , mulder ( david duchovny ) and scully ( gillian anderson ) were left stripped of five years of hard work . 

the film picks up soon after ; and mulder and scully have been reduced to field agents investigating a bomb threat in a federal building . 

but wait , i'm getting ahead of myself . 

the film actually opens in the ice age , about 32 , 000 years prior , during which a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien . 

the alien's blood infects them ( fans of the show will certainly remember the black cancer ) , and the story jumps into modern times , during which a young boy is also infected with the cancer . 

it turns out that the bomb was planted to kill the boy , and mulder and scully uncover the cover-up despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi . 

soon , they find out that the whole thing has to do with aliens . 

as i've written before , it's not easy to write plot summaries for films like this , because everything needs to be a surprise . 

fans of the show will know what to expect , and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film . 

director rob bowman has done a great job expanding the eerie feeling of the show to the big screen , making small adjustments and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television . 

there are some truly suspenseful and well-created scenes here ( late in the film , when they're in the alien spacecraft , you'll see one of the better action sequences in recent cinema ) . 

the special effects are very good , and the production design by christopher nowak is fantastic . 

what i find interesting is that the x-files is actually a great way for series neophytes to get into the story . 

our heroes are given subtle introductions ( we're not expected to know them on the outset ) , and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isn't required to understand the film . 

there are , of course , little elements that the makers have included as payoff to the fans , but i'll keep those as surprises . 

it takes a lot of thought and understanding of the series to create a film using roots as complicated as the ones that the series provides , and then create a coherent film that anyone can understand clearly . 

the series is strong for a lot of reasons . 

it's original ( though it has many ties to "" the twilight zone "" and owes some homage to hitchcock ) , and impressively eerie for a television show . 

what really makes the series shine , however , are the actors . 

duchovny has so much presence , and is just a fun guy to watch . 

he has that confidence that will someday make him into a bankable leading man . 

anderson is equally good , and paralyzingly beautiful ; she's also a strong actress . 

both performers have acted in little more than their series , however , though i think they'll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon . 

i enthusiastically recommend the x-files , both for fans and non-fans . 

1998 is a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters , and this film should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry . 

it's an intelligent film , and takes you places that you might not have been ( or , at least , might not have seen so many times that they feel familiar ) . 

the x-files is impressive in concept , as well : fans of the series are likely to be highly critical , and to take the premise beyond the series is a risky move . 

it's nice to see a risk pay off for a change . 

actually , it's nice to see a risk at all . 
"
"stendhal's syndrome : a condition where , in the presence of art , a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression , suicidal behaviour and personality disorder . 

grim stuff , to be sure , but the subject of a remarkable film from italy's master of the horror thriller dario argento . 

boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone , the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento . 

it follows his disappointing american debut trauma ( 1992 ) , the patchy opera ( 1987 ) and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late 1980's . 

based on the novel by graziella magherini , the film stars argento's daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapist-killer . 

visiting florence to follow up several leads , she is lured by the killer alfredo ( thomas kretschmann ) to an art gallery , a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail . 

at the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints . 

posing as a bystander , alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer , a strange game of cat and mouse begins . 

a gripping story evolves , and a coherent one , too , which may surprise those familiar with argento's often lumpy narratives . 

the stendhal syndrome is not a simple cop-hunting-killer scenario . 

it is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central character's psychological disintegration . 

the script explores its psycho-sexual themes with intelligence and candour , perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers . 

but as dark as its themes are , the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years . 

argento is once again working in his native italy , and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences . 

effects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here , and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent . 

the film's opening 20 minutes segues between hallucination , flashback and real-time with tremendous style . 

proof that , at his most inspired , argento remains one of the world's most exhilarating filmmakers . 

the cast is generally good , though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all but emotionless . 

asia argento's performance is by turns risky , awkward and fascinating . 

it's a difficult role , and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts . 

thomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo , and marco leonardi ( of cinema paradiso , and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy ) does okay as anna's work colleague and increasingly confused love interest . 

but perhaps the stendhal syndrome's single most striking element is ennio morricone's soundtrack . 

active since the 1960's , morricone has scored over 100 films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts . 

it's mostly a variation on the one theme : a slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary , haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards . 

it's been three decades since argento and morricone worked together . 

this is a long welcome reunion . 

if the film has a fault , it is that the last half hour drags a little and the film doesn't quite reach a completely satisfying climax . 

but by the closing scenes , the stendhal syndrome has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argento's career .

"in china in 1982 i turned the tables on our national guide and asked him if he had any questions about america . 

i guess i was expecting some sort of political question . 

instead , i was dumfounded by what was most on his mind . 

 "" in america , do wives and their mothers-in-law get along well ? "" 

he assured me in china that they did , but i am certain if that were true he would not have asked . 

even in china people seem to have problems relating to in- laws . 

perhaps some of life's most difficult relationships arise when families are suddenly artificially joined by marriage . 

a man trying to relate to his new prospective in-laws and vice-versa could be the basis of a very strong comedy . 

meet the parents does not demonstrate that fact , however . 

greg focker ( played by ben stiller ) has been dating and in love with pam byrnes ( teri polo ) for ten months and is now ready to propose to her . 

he will do it during a weekend visit to meet debbie's family and to attend her sister's wedding . 

from the beginning the relationship is awkward between greg and jack and dina byrnes ( robert deniro and blythe danner ) . 

through no fault of his own , the airline has lost greg's luggage . 

and he has to ask to borrow clothing . 

it is the beginning of a game of one-upmanship in which greg is nearly always one-down . 

as the games go on greg is more and more uncomfortable and uneasy which only contributes to the mistakes he makes . 

greg is playing a game he does not understand , in a league he is new to . 

but perhaps along the way he will discover some unexpected secrets about his father-in-law . 

this film had potential in its tale of one-upmanship . 

it has hit on a situation that many in the audience may find familiar--one that has not been done overly frequently in films . 

but the script by jim herzfeld and john hamburg is a little too contrived . 

too many coincidences in the story work against greg . 

the script could not decide if the main character was incompetent or simply unlucky . 

certainly he does not help his situation by doing everything wrong he possibly could , but even when he is trying to do the right things nature conspires against him . 

there is an uneven mix of slapstick sequences and human comedy . 

certainly the last part of the film feels awkwardly written . 

the main reason to see meet the parents is to see robert deniro's performance . 

deniro plays the suspicious and not a little fascistic father as tightly wound and threatening as he can . 

the little judgmental expressions on his face are a show in themselves as greg digs himself deeper and deeper into his insecurities . 

but we do not really see much of that digging . 

ben stiller is an affable presence in the film but is not really stretching himself by playing the role as the nebbish to whom so many bad things happen . 

it is nice to see blythe danner again on the screen . 

but her character has a basic conflict between a basic decency and her love for her husband and the script should have given her more to do with that . 

randy newman has written a playful score . 

in the first few seconds of the film it does something creative i have never heard a film score do before . 

there is a lot of source music that is popular music of the 1960s . 

presumably that is what the upper class listens to at least in somebody's imagination . 

humor is subjective and some this film has been getting some favorable comment . 

but this is a comedy that works only occasionally for me . 

i would have to rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . 
"
"upon first viewing of this movie , the phrases "" been there "" and "" done that "" come quickly to mind . 

spy hard manages to steal almost every joke from the zucker brothers films , the most popular of which are airplane and the naked gun series . 

stealing stuff can be profitable in this industry , but only when you steal the right stuff . 

what little plot there is involves dick steele , aka . 

agent wd-40 ( leslie nielsen ) trying to save the world from an almost deranged madman played by andy griffith . 

along the way to it goal ( goal ? ) , the film manages to spoof mainly the james bond type films , but also manages to hit on films such as home alone and sister act . 

the trick about spoofing is that you have to actually be funny , or at the least , satirical . 

spy hard achieves neither , as it borrows all of the wrong elements from the superior zucker brothers films . 

the "" dick , the world is in danger . 

what is it ? 

well , it's a big roundish ball floating in space around the sun . . 

 ( i'm paraphrasing ) "" type of exchange is used at least four times in the opening ten minutes of the film , each time getting progressively less funny . 

what they should have stolen were the background sight gags which were so effective in the zucker brother's films while writing their own dialogue . 

director rick friedberg focuses more on the mug shots of his actors ( especially nielsen , who can do this quite well ) than on the delivery and context of their lines , much of the time cutting the punchline short . 

the whole film seems to be in a race with itself to be over , as is evident in the final sequence , where there is no comedic denouement after the climax . 

as was usual in the zucker brothers films and in spy hard , the end credits tend to replace this by being out of context . 

one of the more amusing was , "" captain of the enterprise . . . . . . james 

t . kirk "" . 

overall , i thought this was a very weak effort . 

while all of the right films to spoof were chosen , they used none of the right spoofing methods . 

next time they should "" spy "" a little bit harder . 

 * * * * = excellent .

"if you have ever seen fox tv's special car chase programs , you'll have a good idea about the content of ronin , the new action "" thriller "" from director john frankenheimer . 

the film involves a mysterious briefcase , that several groups of terrorist want to get their hands on . 

an irish women , dierdre ( played by the truman show's natascha mcelhone ) , hires a group of mercenaries to assist her in getting the briefcase . 

among the people she hires are sam ( robert de niro ) , vincent ( jean reno ) , and gregor ( stellan skarsg ? rd from good will hunting ) . 

dierdre's groups assignment is too seize the briefcase while the current owners are transporting it . 

they accomplish this task , but a traitor is in the bunch and the briefcase is soon on the run again . 

the briefcase stays on the run , as the movie leads the viewer through several plot twists that are badly executed . 

the writer seemed to be attempting to make a smart action movie , but failed to understand that just because there are surprises , it doesn't add too the credibility of a senseless script . 

the plot twists get no reaction because they come at a time where no one cares what is going on , after the apparent climax of the film . 

but to add to the excitement , as i mentioned earlier , there are endless car chase scenes . 

they are unrealistic and fail to add anything to the story . 

don't get me wrong , i love car chases , but they were overdone and too long here . 

we never do find out what's in the briefcase , but i doubt anyone cares by the time they finish sitting through this two hour long attempted thriller . 
"
"reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others , each derivative in their own special way ) . 

the guy can't seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : "" rule #1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel "" ) , create multi-faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely ) . 

his screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight . 

i can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard , "" oh you thought my movie was gonna go here , f * ck you jack ass , take that twist , decipher this mother f * cker ! "" 

it's almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie . 

and why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ? 

auteur theory be damned ; it's kruger's "" style "" , not the director's that winds up on screen . 

kruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut "" sometimes less is more "" . 

and his numerous twists can't even claim to be originals ; arlington rd's ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j . pakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol' gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn't know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the "" character "" . . . grammar 

be damned ) . 

 "" how did you know that ? "" 

the stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along . 

 . 

 . 

since twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger's screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it's no wonder why he works so frequently . 

he's quickly becoming miramax's mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects . 

this is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr . vehicles . 

their company's current logo could be "" we ride the trends "" . 

reindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head . 

although affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick . 

affleck is such a puppy dog that it's impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone's bitch . 

the role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent "" serious "" movie getting . 

it may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who's played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance ) 

james frain is nick , rudy's cellmate , a manslaughterer who's found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron ) . 

ashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she's never seen one picture of him . 

which works out fine since the character is killed in a near-riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co-horts . 

he plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino . 

though by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i've described might as well be irrelevant . 

this is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one-liner . 

included : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less ) . 

though it's an action film , the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on , incredulous as the audience . 

the flick was directed by john frankenheimer , a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career , fell off the a-list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is slowly climbing his way back up . 

it would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin ( one of those almost but not quite movies ) which followed the island of dr . morneau 

 ( you remember , the one with marlon brando in mime make-up and a not so flattering moo-moo ) , and now this . 

he films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain-zapped mtv audience to pick apart . 

problem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes ) serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play . 

character problems abound ; rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre , the latter of which is not ( at least at this point ) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off . 

the former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear . 

but then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster . 

charlize theron , an extraordinary talent , is , like affleck , playing whatever part the script requires her to play , whether it be vulnerability at one moment , anger at the next . 

she never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes ( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this . 

gary sinise has played this role frequently , and here , as in snake eyes , he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol ( the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more ) , that it becomes more of an annoyance ( oh there he goes again ? ? ? ) than a threat . 

these are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience . 
"
"so here is the second of 1999's remakes of classic horror movies . 

the first was the dumb , pathetic but ok remake of the classic 'the haunting' . 

now comes the highly awaited remake of house on haunted hill . 

the classic which starred vincent price as a man who pays a group of people 100 , 000 to stay in his house . 

if they survive the night they get the money . 

if not well you get the jurisdiction . 

having not yet seen the film ( dvd on its way ) i wasn't sure if i would really like the remake . 

but sure enough it comes through and has a great storyline to fall back on . 

geoffrey rush ( in a fantastic role with an incredible performance ) is steven price , the owner of an amusement park destined to scare the wits out of people . 

his wife evelyn price is throwing a party with her friends . 

steven dismays at the idea and makes his own list . 

somehow someone , or something changes that list and five other people are invited to the party . 

eddie ( taye diggs ) an ex-baseball player , sarah ( ali carter ) an ex-assistant who can re-wire anything , melissa ( brigette wilson ) a talk-show host in sorts , dr . blackburn ( peter ghallager ) , and watson ( chris kattan ) a smart-mouthed humorist in ways . 

what he is gonna do is pay these five people 1 , 000 , 000 dollars if they can survive through the night . 

if they can they get the money , if not well they don't . 

the house on haunted hill used to be an insane asylum . 

years before mental patients broke out and killed the dr . there , forcing him to lock the place up because if he died , so did they . 

everyone who was in there burned to death . 

now it is steven price's home and he is throwing this party for these five people . 

what starts out as a seemingly normal night , turns into a horrifying , blood splattering night . 

the deep dark secrets of what really happened in that asylum and why those guests are actually there are revealed . 

one-by-one the people start to disappear . 

conspiracies start to turn up , and steven price finds out that his house may be alive after all . 

the people find rooms , which once held mental patients . 

rooms which once had people dying . 

rooms which may still contain these people . 

now these five people must try and survive the night and try and survive the house , and they must survive each other with terrorfying results . 

since i officially haven't seen the original i can't say which is better . 

i can say however i liked this movie . 

geoffrey rush gives a one in a million performance as the rich steven price , and does a great job doing a vincent price role . 

famke jansen as his wife was great and even kind of eerie at times . 

ali carter and taye diggs sort of become the main characters and ali carter who debuted in varsity blues gives a fantastic performance here as does taye diggs . 

chris kattan gives us great comic relief and the movie contains a lot of comical lines . 

peter ghallager and brigette wilson were great as well and gave commanding performances as potential victims . 

the plot was well conceived and was very absorbing . 

the movie has atmosphere the whole way through that is disturbing and creepy , and even sometimes downright scary . 

i found even the opening credits to me a little ominous . 

one thing i knew not to expect was a 'haunting' type movie with special effects galore . 

even though it had fantastic gore and special effects , the movie has only a 19 million dollar budget , which doesn's show all the way through but you can tell . 

the movie was written well , and it's only major flaw is the under-developed characters and plot holes that we are left with . 

the ending is quite clever and some may not even get it . 

i must say house on haunted hill was a surprise . 

i was expecting another haunting with special effects , no scares and a dumb ending . 

instead i found a good halloween movie with gore , scares and great acting . 

house on haunted hill is one of those movies you really can't take seriously . 

though it is a well-made movie with a good storyline it still has some flaws . 

but besides that the movie is fun , smart and scary and makes us wonder why remakes like this can't be made all the time !

"what would you do if no one could see you ? 

well , if you're a super smart bio-molecular research scientist working for the military , you'd grope a co-worker and rough-up your neighbor from across the street . 

that's right . 

of all the non-criminal possibilities brought about by rendering oneself invisible , in "" hollow man "" kevin bacon's character opts to commit sex crimes . 

er , it's kevin bacon who plays the super smart military bio-molecular research scientist ? 

something sounds horribly wrong already . 

but this is a paul verhoeven film , and the sleazepin director of such open-crotch classics as "" basic instinct "" and the infamous "" showgirls "" never lets a little credibility get in the way of his voyeuristic tendencies which , when you come right down to it , is all this film is about . 

 "" hollow man "" features a string of hapless , c-list actors ( among them bacon , elisabeth shue , josh brolin , and kim dickens ) in a grade-z plot with a lot of special effects that , frankly , don't look much better than those used in the 1933 version of "" the invisible man . "" 

oh bacon glistens when he gets wet all right and looks like a rather fatty side of cheap flank steak when he's attempting reentry but otherwise it's lots of "" thermal "" shots and inanimate objects ( elisabeth shue included ) bobbing around without any visible signs of support . 

since invisibility , once achieved , isn't much of an effect ( the actors spend half their time conversing with nobody and the other half of their time talking to each other--it amounts to much of a muchness ) , the director elects to wardrobe all of his female protagonists in loosely-buttoned sweaters so that the minute bacon's character gets invisible he can head straight for them . 

it's as if that fascinating concept--what would you do if no one could see you ? --is 

simply a verhoeven ploy to show some skin . 

as a horror film , "" hollow man "" is unsophisticated and disturbing ( in its intent , not its achievements ) and not worth your time or your hard-earned dollars . 

it's minor verhoeven--and even that's not saying much--and boy is it hollow .

"i've never been a member of the robin williams fan club . 

a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way , and i sometimes feel as though i'm watching a 40-year-old class clown . 

in his films , williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy-feely emotion , leading to wildly uneven performances . 

mrs . 

doubtfire seemed ready-made for the same problems , but instead it proves to be williams' best comic screen project yet . 

while it still contains some characteristic self-indulgence , mrs . 

doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly-laugh comedy served up with high energy . 

williams stars as daniel hillard , a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior . 

one such incident proves one too many for wife miranda ( sally field ) , and she files for a divorce . 

unemployed , living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children , daniel decides to respond to miranda's ad for an afternoon housekeeper . 

he turns to his brother frank ( harvey fierstein ) , a theatrical makeup artist , and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire , a matronly 65-year-old englishwoman . 

daniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on miranda's flirtation with a wealthy client ( pierce brosnan ) , to spend time with the children , and to learn something about responsible parenting , all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best . 

mrs . doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work , and basically it does so . 

the most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel , and thanks to the fantastic special makeup that's instantly believable . 

it may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film , making dustin hoffman's dorothy michaels look like milton berle . 

more problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell ; it's a bit hard to swallow that she doesn't recognize any of the voices as her husband's . 

perhaps the biggest contrivance we're asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs . doubtfire in a few minutes . 

there's more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask . 

fortunately , these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll . 

during the film , i was generally too busy laughing . 

after getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams' riffing , mrs . 

doubtfire kicks into high gear once the wig and pads are in place . 

daniel's frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful , as is the climactic restaurant sequence , even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away . 

clearly , most of the credit for doubtfire's success goes to robin williams . 

it took putting him in drag , but for once he plays a comic character that isn't just robin williams with a different name . 

he thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire , and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foul-mouthed . 

wisely , he never aims for saintly . 

his responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty , but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity . 

it's one of mrs . 

doubtfire's charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect , just people trying to be better . 

as miranda , sally field is solid in a background role , and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu . 

the children are also good , although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest . 

the supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing . 

it's easy to see mrs . 

doubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over , and it's true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common . 

but mrs . 

doubtfire manages to carve out its own space , particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judge's decision and the ultimate status of daniel and miranda's relationship . 

there's nothing dazzlingly new in mrs . 

doubtfire , but there are plenty of laughs , and good comedies are always in short supply . 

and it's nice to see robin williams just act for a change . 
"
"one of the contributors to the destruction of the batman film franchise chris o'donnell stars in this remake of buster keaton's 1925 silent film seven chances . 

now i've never seen seven chances , as i'm more of a chaplin fan than a keaton fan , but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this . 

o'donnell plays jimmie shannon , the manager of a pool table manufacturing company . 

he also fears commitment , and despite dating anne ( renee zellweger ) for over three years , he's unwilling to marry her . 

his reasons ? 

well he's a guy you see , and well , guys are like stallions , and they apparently don't like to be roped or something ( hey , that's the movie's explanation . . . 

i'd marry renee zellweger in a second ) . 

eventually it comes time for jimmie to propose , and when he does , it's the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever . 

he essentially says to her , "" you win "" and hands her a ring . 

the audience should now hate this character . 

i did . 

then the meat of the plot presents itself . 

jimmie's grandfather ( peter ustinov , completely wasted ) dies and leaves jimmie his entire estate of 100 million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table business . 

however , in order to get the money and save the jobs of the factory workers , jimmie must be married before his next birthday ( which is just over 24 hours away ) . 

having blown his chances with anne , jimmie proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest a "" business proposition "" . 

the movie wasn't half bad by this time , surprisingly . 

it wasn't boring me , and even managed to read my thoughts at one point . 

ustinov's character left a video will , and while he's reading the ridiculous clause in it , i thought to myself "" what is this , brewster's millions ? "" . 

as soon as i thought it , hal holbrook's character actually says "" what is this , brewster's millions ? "" 

it was quite surreal . 

something happens though during the film's final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was going to receive . 

up to that point , all of jimmie's prior girlfriends had turned down his "" business proposition "" which i felt was good . 

at least the film wasn't painting women to be cold hearted gold diggers . 

when jimmie has no other options , his goofy friend ( played by artie lange , making a career out of playing the goofy friend ) places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page story . 

at this point , 100 , 000 women don wedding gowns and head off to persuade jimmie to pick them to be his bride . 

these women arrive at jimmie's location and immediately start bullying him about what he's looking for in a woman . 

when he's had enough of their unjustified attacks , he tells the angry mob that there's been a mistake and he won't be marrying any of them . 

as a result , the women proceed to chase him around the city , in hopes of catching him and tearing his limbs off . 

this goes on for the rest of the film . 

it's just chris o'donnell running from 100 , 000 obnoxious , greedy , angry and stupid women . 

my groans of disgust could be heard for miles . 

the film finally ended ( thankfully ) , but to this day i'm still groaning . 

the bachelor is available on dvd from new line home video . 

it contains the film in both full frame and in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , cast and crew info , and special dvd-rom features . 

the original theatrical trailer is also on the disc , which contains scenes not in the film . 

apparently there was even more footage of the gang of brides chasing o'donnell around the city , and at one point o'donnell is leaping from the tops of buses . 

so that was bad enough to be cut , but the other 30 minutes of bride shenanigans was good ? 

ugh .

"toward the bottom of the '80s action movie barrel lies action jackson , the only movie in hollywood history to show sharon stone and vanity topless within a span of ten minutes . 

this carl "" apollo creed "" weathers vehicle features the traditional cop vs . evil establishment crook , and relies on all the '80s trappings , from the token heroin addict who needs a fix to the shouting superior officer . 

somewhere in between come the explosions and boobs , although there is a curious lack of exploding boobs . 

weathers is action jackson , a detroit cop known for all sorts of crazy vigilante techniques . 

speaking of one past criminal apprehension , jackson's superior yells , "" you tore his arm off ! "" 

jackson replies , "" he had a spare . "" 

jackson has been busted down to a desk job because of past problems with auto manufacturer dellaplane ( craig t . nelson ) and now has to act as department liaison to a dinner honoring nelson . 

after hearing what jackson thinks of him , stone says , "" i take it you're not one of dellaplane's friends . "" 

 "" not unless they changed the definition , "" jackson glowers . 

and of course it turns out stone is mrs . dellaplane . 

faux pas , jackson . . . 

not everything is happy in motown ; people are being killed and dellaplane has evil plans for the awa . 

it's all up to jackson to stop it , and his only lead lies in vanity ( not his own ) . 

wherever she left off with prince in terms of exchanging sexual favors for career advancement she picks up in action jackson . 

she plays the heroin addict and chanteuse in dellaplane's nightclub . 

after singing one particularly sultry number for him , she saunters over and complains , "" i expected a standing ovation . "" 

he responds , "" you're getting one , "" and it's damn clever because he's sitting down at the time . 

prince wouldn't even let out an innuendo that lame and he's the king of the horndogs . . . 

or at least the prince . 

it's a testament to the '80s that sharon stone is killed off within the first 30 minutes but vanity survives the whole movie . 

action jackson is another variation on the "" unlikely partners "" buddy action flick , with jackson lugging junkie vanity around . 

this leads to some of the worst paired acting of the me decade , and with the dialogue they're given , there's not much room for improvement . 

my favorite is when vanity , feeling the effects of drug withdrawal , says , "" i feel like my teeth are hollow , my gums are made of dry rubber and someone's trying to start a bonfire in the back of my bloody head . "" 

jackson's response is , "" i think i felt that way once . 

they called it love . "" 

you'll understand when i say watch this at your own risk .

"sometimes you just have to tip your hat to a film . 

sometimes you just have to jump on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride . 

i saw the truman show with an audience full of teenagers , most of whom were no doubt drawn by ace ventura himself and hoping to see his latest take on fart jokes . 

surprised , they may have been , when they realized that this picture actually had something to say . 

but by the attentiveness of the crowd i'd say they were won over - as was i . i can't tell yet if truman really is that good , or if it only seems that good in comparison to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of hollywood so far this year . 

time alone will make that call . 

but by the end of the film we were all on truman burbank's side . 

we were concerned for his well-being , and wanted him to win . 

that we felt as we did is a tribute both to the film and to jim carrey , who has achieved legitimacy at last . 

the truman show is a film best viewed cold , with as little foreknowledge as possible about the plot . 

unless you're under a media blackout , however , you probably know the basics . 

carrey stars as truman burbank , a capra-esque everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wife meryl ( laura linney ) in the south florida island town of seahaven , which looks like michael eisner's idea of the perfect american small town . 

truman would seem to live the perfect middle class lifestyle , complete with a working wife , a best bud , friendly neighbors and interesting co-workers . 

there is tragedy in his past - his father drowned in a horrible boating accident , leaving truman with a dreadful fear of water , and of travel in general - but overall , life is good . 

but then one day as truman leaves his house for work , a klieg light falls magically from the sky . 

this curious event may lead truman to discover what the rest of the world already knows : that he is a prisoner on the world's biggest soundstage , that his wife , friends and relatives are all actors paid to interact with him , and that his life has , for over 10 , 000 days , been broadcast as the world's most popular television program . 

what makes the first hour of truman so enjoyable to watch is the magical verisimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol and weir . 

the soundstage , we're told , is "" only the second man-made structure visible from space . "" 

truman's movements are tracked ceaselessly by 5 , 000 cameras scattered throughout the town : button cams , dashboard cams , mirror cams , wife cams , big cams and small cams . 

weir cuts the film so we're never quite sure if we're watching truman through the camera of director weir or through the camera of the show's omnipotent creator christof ( ed harris ) who oversees the show from a control room built into the man-made moon in seahaven's sky . 

the second act offers a plethora of clues for truman as to the truth of his existence . 

his best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) always has a six pack of beer with him . 

his wife seems to exist in an eternal commercial in which she is always endorsing the latest hot household product . 

he sees the same people walking in the same set patterns all over town . 

one wonders why he didn't pick up on any of this earlier , but christof has an answer for this : "" people tend to accept the reality with which they're presented . "" 

nevertheless , truman begins to grow restless , and dreams of escape to fiji , where an old college sweetheart ( natasha mcelhone ) supposedly lives . 

this convincing reality of television as progenitor of reality is a magical and provocative concept ; the best thing jim carrey does is stay out of its way . 

by underplaying truman , he allows the subtle manipulations of the film to take over . 

there is a particularly poignant scene in which truman confides his fears to marlon , and marlon answers with best-friend sincerity , "" i'd gladly step in front of a bus for you . "" 

but that line was fed to marlon through an earpiece by christof . 

the abject cruelty to which truman is subjected to hits home - and from that moment , we're on his side . 

the truman show derives much of its success from playing to our own secret paranoid fantasies - haven't we all , at least once , doubted our place in the world , doubted the sincerity of those closest to us ? 

ultimately , however , the picture rises above its own artifice to raise some real questions about the relationship of humankind and our creator . 

what does god really think of us ? 

does he resent our abandonment of paradise ? 

who exactly is watching us , up there in the sky ? 

if you enjoy the picture as much as i did , credit weir for allowing the magic of the screenplay to work . 

as for carrey - well , truman burbank is the kind of role that jimmy stewart was born to play . 

carrey is no jimmy stewart ; to his credit , he doesn't try to be . 

he just tries to feel the way you or i would , if we suddenly found out that the whole world was watching us .

human survivors are systematically hunted down and destroyed . 

however , some humans are fighting back led by the heroic john connor . 

to stop connor , the machines send a terminator ( arnold schwarzenegger ) back to 1984 to murder connor's mother , sara ( linda hamilton ) , and thus prevent connor from ever being born . 

in response , the humans send a protector , kyle reese , played by michael biehn . 

images of machines and of humans' reliance on machines dominate the film . 

even though the characters know that the benign oil drillers of 1984 will become the ruthless hunter killers of 2029 , humans continue to use the machines . 

in the climax of star wars , luke relies on the force alone--his own spiritual power--to destroy the death star . 

in the terminator , however , sara must use another machine--a giant hydraulic press--to vanquish her enemy . 

cameron seems to be implying that this reliance on technology is inescapable--and he's not happy about it . 

unabated technological growth brings about the terminator's other obsession : the apocalypse . 

we have plenty of imagery regarding armageddon : thousands of human skulls line the streets of future la . 

children watch the flames in a burning television . 

when the terminator arrives in 1984 an almost biblical lightning storm precedes him . 

even though the "" future is not set , "" there is no doubt about where the world is headed at the end of the movie : the machines will rise and the humans will have to struggle for their very existence . 

all sara can do is await it . 

 ( cameron doesn't wimp out like he does in terminator 2 ) 

the end of the world is the human race's own fault , too . 

after all it is the humans that created in the evil machines in the first place . 

back in 1984 , when the cold war was still in full effect , the film must have been seen as a very apt metaphor for nuclear war ( another obsession of cameron's ) . 

these days , one can read a criticism of machine-like behavior in humans . 

true , humanizing touches are put into paul winfield's and lance henriksen's detective characters , but the terminator is also able to move through the city undetected . 

cameron also draw parallels between the mechanical efficiency between the terminator and reese when they first arrive in 1984 la . 

from a technical standpoint the terminator is very well done . 

arnold schwarzenegger is a perfect antagonist--unstoppable , merciless , obdurate . 

we are not meant to empathize with this ultimate killing machine as we are in some of schwarzenegger's later works ( eg , commando ) , but fear him . 

cameron and hurd's script basically depicts a one hour and forty-five minute chase , taking a few moments here and there to explain time travel and develop the romantic subplot . 

while we do see the hackneyed dialogue cameron is now so well known for , there is also considerable suspense especially for the first time viewer who may be unsure of kyle reese's intentions . 

cameron directs the film at a rapid , kinetic pace . 

either the camera is moving or something within the frame is moving--usually both occurs . 

the violence is not particularly graphic ( temple of doom's heart-pull scene outgrosses the terminator's ) , but it is brutally staged making it that much more effective . 

for a low budget film , the terminator's special effects and art direction ( especially in 2029 la ) are remarkably well done . 

special mention should be made of the stop motion effects work at the end of the film depicting the terminator endoskeleton . 

it is some of the best stop motion i have ever seen . 

one thing that doesn't hold up after all the years , however , is linda hamilton's hairdo . 
"
"years ago , robin williams made _jumanji_ , a brilliant achievement in special effects , but a travesty on nearly every other level . 

the same can be said for _what dreams may come_ , a boring , illogical , weepie-wannabe that left my senses numb . 

don't get me wrong : i love breathtaking special effects and pulse-pounding imagery . 

_brazil_ is on my personal top ten . 

_the city of lost children_ is a great film because of its outlandish scenarios . 

i even love _2001_ and _last year at marienbad_ , being in the minority amidst my friends . 

_what dreams may come_ , imagery aside , has little daring thought to complement its imagery . 

the daring thought it _does_ have is never fully realized . 

it's idea of a plot is so lukewarm , that it insults the bigger questions it raises . 

it would have been better if the filmmakers rid the film of the live action sequences , put on an electronica soundtrack , and sell it as one of those popular _mind's eye_ videos . 

robin williams plays chris nielsen , who dies too prematurely--not only in the story , but before we have a chance to really know and care for him . 

the director , vincent ward , and the screenwriter ronald bass , have chosen to tell his life story in flashbacks while having the foreground story focus on his experience with the afterlife . 

big mistake . 

it would have been far better to take the half-hour or so needed to tell his life story first ( ala _it's a wonderful life_ ) , so that i can build up respect for him , so i could know and possibly care for him , his children , and his long-suffering wife ( played superbly by annabella sciorra ) . 

instead , the filmmakers insult my intelligence by rushing into the story , expecting that the film to grow in depth as it progresses . 

it doesn't . 

so in the afterlife , chris learns that ( a ) people still don't meet god , ( b ) that our thoughts are reality , and ( c ) time does not exist there . 

hmm . . . 

i+ll grant one of those silly giant ideas for the sake of the narrative . 

 ( the "" not meeting god "" part still irks at me , but perhaps there was no possible way to film it and give it due respect ) . 

that said , this alternate reality still makes no possible sense . 

read on . . . 

chris' wife commits suicide . 

since suicides go to hell , chris would be separated from his wife forever . 

the important question is , is heaven really heaven if you are separated from the one you love ? 

good question . 

and i like good thought-provoking questions . 

i don+t like it when the filmmakers deviate from the question . 

i _loathe_ it when the filmmakers deviate from the question so that the film becomes a popular rescue film , especially a rescue film which does not take its underlying premise seriously . 

i _really_ loathe it when it+s story is no longer run by logic , but by special effects . 

hey chris : did you forget ? 

your thoughts are _real_ . 

they are more _real_ than the physical world , according to the new-age screenplay . 

so , why don+t you conjure up positive thoughts of annie , and let that run wild ? 

and then she would appear before you , and you two would live in happy bliss for eternity ? 

because there would be no movie , that+s why . 

and albert the angel ( played by miscast cuba gooding , jr . ) says bluntly : "" that+s fantasy . "" 

umm . . . 

if your thoughts are more real than the physical , then fantasy is not fantasy , but real . 

surely some eastern meditation specialist would be able to tell you that . 

and if you happen to think that you are an unimaginative person , and that your thoughts aren't big enough to sustain you for eternity , well , in all due respect , that's why i don't subscribe to this theology . 

all due respect . 

another idea , based on "" time , ( pause ) , does not exist here ! "" 

so chris , spend your eternity with annie , as she is on earth , reliving your favorite memories , or hang out with her when she was growing up . 

you+ve got eternity : perhaps you can hang around long enough and learn not to freak her out . 

and forcing her to write "" i still exist "" in her diary , imo , is just too tacky . 

there are many other ideas , all of which are a hundred times better than what+s unraveled in the plot . 

the great aforementioned question is sidetracked into gimmicky subplots that have been done before , and just come out stale . 

most insulting is the subplot where important people in chris+ life appear in heaven differently than he expects , so when they finally show themselves , he realizes they were with him all along . 

and when this happens , the film runs in slow motion , as if to build emotion . 

_gag me with a spoon_ . 

so the only things for me to like are sciorra+s effective performance , who rises far above this mundane material , and the special effects . 

please note that while i enjoyed some of the visuals , i did not enjoy _all_ of them : some of the images looked like sandy duncan universe , everybody floating up and down in invisible strings . 

it sounds like a joke , but it+s really true : i really tried to block out the dialogue , and figure out what music would best work as an alternative soundtrack . 

my vote goes to a rare cd called "" never say die "" ( 1981 ) from petra , a christian rock group . 

it+s pretty good , and they have a song about annie , who commits suicide . 

 ( it+s too late for annie/she+s gone away for good/there+s so much we'd have told her/and now we wish we could/but it+s too late . . . ) . 

melancholic , yes . 

depressing , yes . 

but far more entertaining . . . 

so , in case you don+t know , let me be straight . 

suicide--bad . 

_don+t do it_ . 

no . no . no . ( got it ? --you 

shouldn+t have to pay $7 . 50 to hear this in an awful robin williams schmaltzfest . )

"i know that "" funnest "" isn't a word . 

 "" fun "" is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective . 

but that's the word that came to me right after viewing "" chicken run . "" 

no wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like "" that was the funnest movie i've ever seen ! "" 

so to hell with webster's -- "" chicken run "" is one of the funnest movies i've seen in a while . 

i can't remember the last time i've seen anything funner . 

the chickens at tweedy's farm are up to something . 

living in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box . 

one night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer . 

rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs . tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm's egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan . 

she orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , "" chickens go in ; pies come out . "" 

what sort of pies ? 

chicken pies , of course . 

co-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : "" creature comforts , "" "" the wrong trousers , "" and "" a close shave . "" 

the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . 

part of what made the "" wallace "" films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . 

 "" the wrong trousers , "" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and "" a close shave "" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . 

but in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived . 

now teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in "" chicken run . "" 

the plot is largely lifted from "" the great escape "" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . 

thing is , the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; "" chicken run "" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . 

part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? 

park and lord milk the incongruity for all it's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . 

but they're * chickens * , so it's funny to us . 

another thing that helps "" chicken run "" ( and most of park's films ) succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing . 

there are references to "" the great escape , "" obviously , and "" stalag 17 . "" 

the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both "" raiders of the lost ark "" and "" indiana jones and the temple of doom . "" 

there's even a nod to "" the blues brothers , "" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson's nationality and film history . 

the "" braveheart "" reference is a hoot if you catch it . 

when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , "" chicken run "" is downright brilliant in its execution . 

consider this : since july of last year , i've seen dozens upon dozens of "" blair witch project "" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . 

out of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . 

why ? 

because once you got past the thought that "" they're parodying that 'blair witch' movie , "" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . 

they were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . 

conversely , "" chicken run "" doesn't lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . 

if you've never seen "" indiana jones , "" the chase sequence is still fun . 

even if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . 

park , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it's understood , and as a result , "" chicken run "" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . 

enjoyment of this movie doesn't require knowledge of film history , but if you've got it , "" chicken run "" is that much richer . 

the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it's hard not to fall in love with every one of them . 

ginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on "" absolutely fabulous "" ) nails it . 

she has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . 

the characters' inevitable romance doesn't feel contrived , but sweet . 

poor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn't any help . 

jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . 

they even come up with an inspired riff on something that's baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . 

one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of "" chicken run , "" it comes as a delightful surprise . 

the film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . 

the animation is first-rate . 

remember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable "" chicken run "" really is . 

this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . 

as in such top-notch family fare as "" a bug's life "" or "" toy story 2 , "" "" chicken run "" has something to offer in nearly every frame . 

certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they'll catch all the details . 

anyway , the movie's just a boatload of fun . 

funnest damn movie i've seen all year .

"expand the final fifteen minutes of home alone into a feature-length film and you've got baby's day out--an agreeably amusing children's comedy about a bumbling band of kid kidnappers who are unwittingly outwitted by an innocent infant . 

the plot tracks a trio of crooks-posed-as-photographers ( mantegna , pantoliano , haley ) who steal nine-month-old bennington august cottwell iv , aka baby bink , from his old-money home . 

but the plan goes awry when baby crawls out an open window and into the streets of downtown chicago ! 

following the path of his favorite story , called "" baby's day out , "" baby rides a bus and visits the zoo and winds up at a skyscraper construction site . 

while baby stays unscathed , the crooks fare worse for the wear . 

the stooges get hit by boards and dropped from roofs and , of course , suffer multiple crotch injuries . 

 ( john wayne bobbitt should probably steer clear of this one . ) 

like he did in planes , trains , and automobiles , john hughes again demonstrates his mastery of the simple set-up and extended execution . 

here , he's aided and abetted by a director , patrick read johnson , whose choreography could rival a coen brother . 

best bit : baby crawling across a busy city street . 

baby's day out has only two emotions--awww and ouch--and the actors play them accordingly . 

forget the cartoon concern of lara flynn boyle or cynthia nixon , disposable as mom and nanny , respectively , the ones to watch are the ones who are wincing . 

joe mantegna is a great head stooge , barking lines like "" that little doo-doo machine is my retirement money . "" 

brian haley has a great scene with a gorilla , while joe pantolianto plays curly to mantegna's moe . 

 * he * is funny . 

needless to say , twins adam and jacob warton are adorable beyond belief .
